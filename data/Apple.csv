"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got a really good looking phone I‚Äôve got the gold 256 GB and it‚Äôs really a upgrade from my old Samsung battery health did come at 85%. I guess that‚Äôs decent right other than that it‚Äôs a really great phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was having a real problem (to me) with the ""Zoom"" feature. I must have been unknowingly touching the screen with three fingers, thus enlarging the font too much for the screen size. After de-selecting that ""Zoom"" feature, I became happy again with the purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was I nervous to buy a $500 iphone on Amazon? Yes! I am glad I did, the phone arrived in excellent condition, with a screen protector already on. I'm very happy its not cracked or majorly scratched, I recommend buying this phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really enjoyed battery life,facial recognition is something new for me enjoying my iPhone very much"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Okay Reviewers I ordered this IPhone 11 Pro Max off of my sons prime account.. This is one bad ass phone! And I got a great deal from this amazing company! Shipping was on point! And this phone OMG perfect! Like it came from Apple! If I didn‚Äôt know it was refurbished? I would have thought it was never touched! That‚Äôs how perfect it is! I felt like a child at Christmas! Stoked! So, definitely would and will buy from this company again! Thank you for your loyalty to your customers! Super excited! Placed it in a case as soon as I looked at it .
Okay about the iPhone 11 Pro Max .. outside of it‚Äôs beauty . Wish I could take a picture of it , but i can‚Äôt . I‚Äôm on it..
the 11 is holding its value for great reasons .. it really is a bad ass phone !! And the 12‚Äôs are nice but the 11‚Äôs sit right next to those 12‚Äôs ! But cheaper in price but the quality is all the same!
The pictures are amazing!!! ( FYI My son has the 12 My sister 12 pro and brother in law has 12 pro Max ) so pictures are not so noticeably different.. cause this 11 pro Max takes great photos also and the battery life is awesome ! 24 hrs no charge and still had life left! I have charged it with the cord charging ( it came with a good charging cord not junk) and I also have charged it with the magnetic cordless charging.. about the same.
I have not done the face recognition as of yet.. I use a passcode.. I do miss the finger / thumb recognition button but from what I see with my son ? Face recognition is prob just as fast or faster?
The speakers on this is loud! Love it!
Now yes this is a bigger device it is a 6.5 in screen but it‚Äôs not bulky at all ! The phone is slender not heavy but a case did help tremendously holding it cause it‚Äôs so thin.. haha i dont know how to explain that one but I Dont know to drop it haha so a case helps to grip it .. if that makes sense ? Lol
But with the cheaper price tag ? I was able to get the highest GB and still save a few hundred‚Äô dollars!
I did my research cause I was looking at this phone for a while and then was gearing for the 12 pro Max for it has 3 or 4 better features. But After comparing and deep research? What was being said is true! The 11‚Äôs are amazing phones! And unless your a Photographer? You won‚Äôt see a inkling of a difference with the camera or video.. the processor in the 11‚Äôs are also fast and made right! Apple surly did a great job with the 11‚Äôs !!! So again for what you get and with that price tag ? You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Iphome 11 pro Max! I‚Äôm freaking happy I got one heck of a deal ! I love the look ,the quality, how fast it responds, the pictures, the battery life, the features, and the company that I bought it from! Hope this helps with someone‚Äôs research and decision making!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was in new condition and clean operation when received. Upgraded from 7 Plus. A good jump in speed and quality."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente servicio y tel√©fonos en lo personal tuve un peque√±o inconveniente pero inmediatamente me dieron soluci√≥n 100% recomendado entre mi familia y amigos"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and it‚Äôs been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. I‚Äôve gotten the run around told several different story‚Äôs! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still haven‚Äôt seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! It‚Äôs a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! It‚Äôs very aggravating and a headache it‚Äôs not $20 or something it‚Äôs almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully you‚Äôre experience is better!

I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didn‚Äôt know it was ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù I‚Äôd swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and it‚Äôs now 4:23pm the next day and it‚Äôs still yet to go dead I‚Äôve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but that‚Äôs not a big deal I guess. I‚Äôve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! That‚Äôs a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud. If ever needed I will definitely come back to this seller with no hesitation at all! I‚Äôm just very pleased with everything over all!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good but worth the price !
No issues !
Just need a good charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great customer service!!! First phone the volume was low and they returned with no problems. Second phone is perfect!! Will definitely do business again!! Thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Deben mejorar el nivel de bater√≠a y el estado de la pantalla"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Externally the iPhone I flawless, but the battery is not good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very happy with this purchase. Paid for 256 memory. Received phone with 512 memory. I feel I got a fantastic deal."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy correcto y profesional"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great shape, the only reason for the 4 star is there is nothing on the phone or the packaging with the IMEI number. Made it more difficult to get the device activated because you had to get it hooked up to itunes prior to activating the services with my carrier."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with everything a new phone comes with, I had absolutely NO PROBLEM placing my SIM card in it and downloading my other iPhone profile and works perfectly !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Its like brand new,"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs too old and little scratches everywhere. It doesn‚Äôt look like what I saw on the site."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dislike the glitches"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I recommend this product. I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone worked well overall, until a made a phone call. The main speaker on the top front of the phone that sits on your ear during a call must‚Äôve been busted because it was barely audible. There were about 3 deep scratches on the screen as well, all of those was unexpected as I purchased the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. The battery health was 87%, which was acceptable for a used phone. It was great besides the speaker and scratches which I ultimately returned it because of. Return process was smooth and I got my money back within 3-4 days of shipping my return."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I want to recommend that you choose Sikksound to purchase from! I just ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Max silver Friday, received it the following Monday. When I received the package I was kind of nervous because the packaging was so small, but they had everything packed nice and tidy! I had no problems with my SIM card, it worked immediately, I had a little issue with my Apple ID but I figured it out, nothing to do with the seller. The phone didn‚Äôt have a single scratch, it literally looks brand new, LITERALLY! Face ID, touch screen, camera, speaker, everything works! Batter life is at 97%, which is more then I expected! If I ever need to purchase a phone again, I will be purchasing from them! Thank you! üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent condition! Price is great!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in great condition. No cratches. It even had on a screen protector. Phone is currently being used in Jamaica with no issues connecting to the local network."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have this 4 stars because although the phone was on very good condition. When unboxing it comes with a very sticky protective sheet on top of the screen. Upon removing the sheet unlike apple
Leaves a sticky film covering the entire screen. Water or little soap alone was not able to remove this film.
My husband had to use an adhesive remover a few time to completely remove the film."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looks great and even came with its own screen protector like new. I did check my battery life on it and it‚Äôs 82"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I try to swipe it barely can swipe I try to purchase on Amazon to confirm my purchase I have to swipe, it won‚Äôt allow me to swipe and the letters don‚Äôt work properly on key board"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love everything about this phone. Bought it as a gift and they love it. Great condition and great price. Deffinately recommend this phone and this seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone only lasted 6 months."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone working pretty good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","They liked the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice size"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When it eventually arrived I was pleasantly surprised how good it looked. I have had a couple of instances where the touchscreen hasn‚Äôt registered on the first/second touch but other than that it has worked well so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It seems like a brand new phone to me because I can‚Äôt tell the difference."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm so happy! At first I was skeptical, because I read some negative reviews! I ended up buying the iphone 11 pro max silver 64gb unlocked and I received what i ordered!! I had an iphone 7 plus, and I bought this with my own money. I'm so happy. I love the camera, good screen with NO scratches, and it's so pretty! Will be recommending to my friends and family! although the phone has 84% battery health, but i honestly don't care. mine old phone was in the 70's lol. :)))))))))))))"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone itself is very high quality. The graphics are amazing, the apps load quickly, the camera is very nice. The phone is pretty heavy though. I haven‚Äôt noticed that with newer iPhone models so if the weight of the phone might be an issue for you, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this one. The product isn‚Äôt damaged at all and it came with a SIM card remover tool and a charger and charger box. The shipping for me was difficult though. They kept on pushing forward the delivery date up until I had called and went off on them, then it has gotten to my house on time."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","VERY HAPPY FIND OF THIS PHONE!!
was skeptical about buying an used phone because I always buy the refurbished ones directly from apple but now it was not the case because inflation and prices going up.

Had do give my newest ip 13 and go back to this one due to bad battery and that I didnt like the feel of the ip13 and this really gave my hopes back.

Avant Solutions was my seller and it had all original parts, not icloud locked and, the battery health was at 92% !!!! The listing for these phones guarantees at least more than 80% but this was much better.

As any used phone, it should have knicks and dents and mine only had a small scratch on an edge (presumably because previous owner drop it without a case on) and it came with a tempered glass on!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was just as expected! The product even came with a screen protector and was just as described. Great job!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good price and works perfect! The only reason I had purchased an Android over a month ago was I didn‚Äôt want to pay for a bigger iPhone 11. So after a month of working on that droid, I found this iPhone 11 Pro Max at a reasonable price. Always will buy renewed iPhones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal use. I like everything for now"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dropped out of my pocket when I sat in a chair (2‚Äô off the ground) and the middle of my screen cracked."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone came in 3 days, perfect condition very satisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was ok but the screen is faulty. Phone fell with screen protector AND a phone case on. Somehow only the phone screen broke while the screen protector was intact"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought mine from chubbiestech and they did good. The phone had no scratches fully functional and battery health was 87% and it‚Äôs pretty good. Other than that it was perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn't expect it to get stuck every few days during important calls or using apps. The screen freezes and occasionally closed out of an app while in use without saving changes or progress. Hardware was in great condition, but using this phone made it difficult to complete tasks, access docs/drives to share, access photos and at the very least mute or increase volume during calls."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the 11 pro max ( obvi lol ) , silver , 256 gb . i was a tiny bit nervous due to some of the negative reviews but i jus got this phone and initially it‚Äôs fine to me . it came unlocked , no previous icloud was linked to it . all buttons work fine , camera is fine , face id is fine , volume / speakers are fine . battery capacity is at 87% which is fine cus i currently have an xr , 64 gb , 73% capacity .. so a bit of an upgrade for me . it‚Äôs so new to me ( like an hour old ) so i haven‚Äôt set it up yet but like i said it came unlocked and the imei number ( or whatever lol ) says ‚Äú no sim restrictions ‚Äú so i believe it‚Äôs unlocked and i don‚Äôt believe i‚Äôll have any problems setting it up. like i said i literally jus got the phone but so far i‚Äôm really happy & relieved & inlove .. and it came w a bit of mild scratching only on the sides of the phone but i‚Äôll have a case on it anyways , no screen scratches or scratches on the back or on neither cameras . hopefully it lasts a couple years or so and it also has a 90 day return / replacement warranty ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo mejor es el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is good but a red dot came on my camera."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My only MAJOR complaint is that the speaker is a little damaged. Music sounds staticky and so do phone calls from both ends. But the face recognition, battery life and camera all looks brand new. So you get what you pay for with this one. All in all I definitely don‚Äôt regret buying a renewed phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a hit and Miss. You can either get a good condition Version or a totally scratched up phone that was previously owend by a cat."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is amazing I‚Äôm so happy I ordered from them my phone came so fast and it looked brand new no scratches or anything!! Camera is so clear as well!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like in the title this is an amazing phone that works perfectly except for the speaker i mentioned. To clarify the speakers work but the bottom speaker seems to have some water damage because it makes slight static noises and is muffled a bit. Couldn‚Äôt find a fix for this but it‚Äôs a minor problem compared to everything else. So far, i would recommend paying for the renewed premium option and i‚Äôll update this review if anything major happens."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very satisfied with the purchase got it today phone was spanking new !!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","You would think spending this much for a used product it would at least be functional, but not the case for this guy. Phone has 82% battery and dropped 50% life sitting in my pocket for 2.5 hours meaning I have 5 hours of max life when not using. Have my appointment to get the battery replaced as I would rather pay $69 for a new one than go through the hassle of a return and repurchase. Based on other reviews it looks like you are rolling the dice in batteries period. Would recommend adding $69 out of pocket for anyone using these refurbished phones. Outside of battery, everything else seems top notch so far. Bought my wife a refurbished from another vendor that came with a new battery and will be going with them next time for my own.

Update - seller stated that in the end I purchased a refurbished (so essentially buyer beware in their own words!) and could send it in for a replacement, but cannot guarantee it will be better as it is another refurbish. Still spending the $69 to simply fix the issue with a new battery and would encourage any one purchasing from them to add that to your true total cost. Next time will buy directly from apple with a legit guarantee as my cost to go with this seller is only $100 cheaper in total spent, but now with a clearly lower quality refurbish and customer support team. Not worth the time and hassle and lesson learned."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery health was 100% when i got it. This kicks my 2020 SE‚Äôs ass for sure"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone in very good condition. Minor scratch on screen but nothing to worry about."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So for my birthday I was gifted the iPhone 11 which was really nice at first but 3 days in it started to crack. And the longer the day went on the more the cracks started to spread.
So had to return that phone which made me very skeptical of getting the iPhone 11 Pro Max instead.
I had literally no problems with setting it up or transferring everything, which was such a relief.

Have had this phone for a few months and so far no cracks, no scrapes, camera works beautiful, and I can actually hear people when I‚Äôm on the phone! The iPhone 11 had TERRIBLE audio and I always had to turn on speaker for calls yet could barely hear.

I don‚Äôt normally do reviews but this surprised me with how well it‚Äôs going. üôåüèªü•πü•π"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone has issues with the earpiece unless I use hands free or EarPods I have to use the speaker I like the memory space"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i gave 4 stars cuz sometimes the phone glitches out and i can‚Äôt touch the screen but other than that everything is good. my battery health was at 85 when i got it (may 24) and it‚Äôs still at 85."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My IPhone 11 Pro Max arrived much earlier than the delivery date, the phone looks like new just a tiny scratch in the screen but you don‚Äôt eve notice, it come with a different charger but works fine and charge fast, the battery life was 82%, no that bad for a refurbished phone. so far the phone works very well let's see what happens later. But I will definitely buy again from the seller Refoned!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","If you‚Äôre like me, you don‚Äôt want to get wrapped up in a contract for a brand new phone, but you still want to feel like you‚Äôre not far behind the newest iPhone. Well, this is it. I upgraded from the Xr and it‚Äôs a night and day difference. The iPhone 11 Pro Max should be the go to for anyone looking to stay in the ballpark of $500 for a phone. I feel as though this phone will still still be relevant for a while."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pristine condition with 100% battery health, thanks Amazon for another great iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone shipped exactly like the description. Works perfectly and just what I wanted."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","To be honest I can't really rate the product due to the fact that I haven't had the phone for a month. So far so good ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was totally amazed by this phone. it came with 98% battery health and the phone was spotless. Besides the box and the refurbish notes that come with it, you would think this phone was brand new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I RARELY leave any reviews but I'm DISAPPOINTED because I paid the extra money for the ""excellent condition"" to avoid things like this. (sorry for the pictures. hard to capture the dents on such a shiny surface, tried to include flash and no flash pics and this might be a little long)

Straight out the box, there is not only a scratch on one of the back cameras that shows up through pictures, (I checked) and another one on the surrounding glass of all three cameras on the back but also the front-facing camera has little DENTS/DIVETS. The ENTIRE device has these little dents all throughout the phone. Many of them are scattered over the screen, a cluster of them on the back (that I forgot to take a picture of), HOWEVER, the sides are the worst. It is pretty noticeable, even from a foot or 12 inches away as the description described. I'm not even sure what could cause that because on the sides it mostly looks internal. It is a different color entirely from the color of the phone.

ALSO, as you can see from the pictures it is also like DIRTY? There is some weird white substance in the grooves/seems on all four sides of the ENTIRE phone. The white substance was neither in the amazon box, the box the phone came in, nor in the sleeve that the phone was placed in so that means it was packaged with whatever the white stuff is and sent.

To top it off, the battery capacity is only 84% PERCENT. This is not in ""excellent condition.""

Pretty disappointed because other customers seemed to have a pretty good experience. Going to have to return which annoys me because I rarely do returns as well and try to avoid it. :("
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After looking at my options this phone and Amazon‚Äôs warranty seemed like my best option. It is like new and a breeze to set up. My only complaint was it came with a vinyl screen protector that was poorly installed. It was peeling off when I got it do just removed it. Replaced my failing 8+ and is a nice upgrade!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our iPhone 11 Pro Max we received was virtually flawless. The screen had no scratches, but the battery did require more charging. Nonetheless, the transferring of data/files was easy, as we took both phones to an AT&T store. All was done in less than 30 minutes. The part that took the longest was adding the Apple Watch to the new phone. The whole process took another 40 minutes. Overall, the entire experience was very positive. This is our 3rd phone purchase from the Renewed at Amazon, and have not had a bad experience thus far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS AMAZED HOW NEW THIS PHONE LOOKED NOT ONE SCRATCH I WILL SAY THERE IS 1 tiny tiny chip of paint missing by the camera lens but it‚Äôs super tiny it‚Äôs more lik a dot not noticeable at all other than that not one mark I transferred my service over with no problem everything works no glitches or problems AT ALL AND AT FIRST I BOUGHT THIS SAME IPHONE FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER ON HERE FOR ALMOST $200 MORE AND WAS SENT A SUPER SMALL IPHONE SO I SENT IT BCK AND FOUND THIS ONE SO IM GLAD I HAD THAT HAPPEN CUZ THIS ONE WORKS AMAZING AND I PAID $200 LESS AND IVE SEARCHED ON HERE THIS IS THE CHEAPEST IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ON AMAZON SO IF UR LOOKING FOR THIS IPHONE UNLOCKED THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY AND 1 MORE THING I HAVE METRO BY T-MOBILE AND IT HOOKED UP WITH NO PROBLEMS"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","only thing I didn't like was the length it took to get here. but love the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","From the point I placed my order, the seller was straight forward with the order. I originally ordered a silver 11 pro max and that color was out of stock so the seller worked with me getting me a space grey model instead! Within hours, the order had been shipped out and I got it 2 days later. Extremely well packaged, the phone was on and ready to go with a full battery. Inserted my SIM card (for Verizon) and there were no issues, started right up on my network, no issues with the ESN (clean, not blacklisted). I‚Äôve had it for roughly a week and a half and it works great! No issues, looks brand new, came with a third party charger and cable (not apple certified cube) and a sim port pin. I‚Äôd highly recommend this seller and would gladly order again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic quality phone out of the box. Thanks seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","üßêüßêüßê"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was nervous to buy after seeing so many bad reviews , but the phone is great! Its in Excellent condition. I had a hard time finding any scuffs or marks i dont think i have any. Everything is as promised i just wish my battery health was higher than 82% otherwise it wouldve been a 5 star rating"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was the renewed and not the renewed premium so I figured there may be superficial damage but I did not realize there would be a decent handful of micro scratches directly to the screen. I opened the box and was immediately disappointed. It looked like something I could have bought from a random guy in a mall food court rather than a refurbished phone. The scratches were not huge or deep but where very visible when the light hit them even at an arms length to everyone that looked at it. Requested the return a few minutes after opening the box and shipped it back the very next morning. I did get a quick refund with no real hassle but would have rather had a phone with a decent screen. I then ordered the renewed premium. The last two photos are what I ended up receiving where someone had put on a tape type protector that left a disgusting layer of thick sticky residue completely covering the touch screen. After about a solid two hours of cleaning and I finally had a clean phone but for being renewed premium that‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. No scratches obvious on the screen of the second phone and generally happy with the performance but the arrival appearance probably would have made me ship it back again if I was not stubborn to the core. It‚Äôs like Amazon wanted me to return both and go to Apple and to buy a brand new phone (which was the next step if I couldn‚Äôt get the screen clean on the second one)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono estaba desbloqueado, bater√≠a 90%. Muy bueno."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is great just it‚Äôs legit and is the exact thing that you pay for I was spectacle at first but once it arrived I was excited that I got what I expected I do suggest reading the description first because a lot of people made me get mixed emotions about buying this phone online. But overall it all worked out in the end and I‚Äôm happy so I definitely recommend buying."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 I bought this phone refurbished, but it came in good condition. Maybe one small scratch, but other than that, it was clean and well maintained. However, soon after I booted it up and transferred all my information and such, I got an alert that it couldn't be determined in the screen/display was a ""genuine Apple part."" I didn't think a lot of it, but the next day, my screen started flickering (orange/blue) and glitching. This has been happening for weeks now. There is hardly ever a second where the screen is on where it doesn't flicker orange. The only remedy is turning my brightness way down. Even that doesn't fix it because 1) I can't see the screen hardly and 2) I probably just can't SEE the flickering. Often, it'll get progressively more flicker-y until sometimes I see 'double' on the screen and it freezes. Like, I can't push any buttons or anything so I have I to turn it off and turn it back on. This doesn't actually fix the flickering but at least it un-freezes my phone (sometimes). This type of thing happens a minimum of 8 or so times a day. I suspect this is all to do with the alert about the display I got, but now I'm not sure because I no longer see the alert in settings.

Yes, I've tried restarting my phone. Yes, I've tried deleting apps that might be causing it to glitch. When I looked it up, I found that it may be due to some certain display settings being turned on, but I'm convinced it's not that. I'm pretty tech savvy and I've never seen this before.

Overall, it's a great phone, great camera etc. and worth your money. But, it's probably a better idea to buy new so you don't have to deal with any defective issues."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered the phone in the morning and it showed up at my house at 6pm! I was so surprised and happy.

I was kind of concerned with the reviews but the phone was such a good deal that I went for it anyway. It does have some very small scratches in the top right corner of the display like maybe some keys rubbed on it at some point in a bag - but when the screen is on you can‚Äôt see them at all. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this was a wonderful deal and the rest of the phone looks completely new. My battery is at 97% and has lasted for hours and hours. No issues there.

I guess my suggestion is that if you‚Äôre going to be nit picky about scratches or dents, don‚Äôt buy a used phone. I‚Äôm extremely happy for what I paid."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se entreg√≥ en muy buenas condiciones, con muy leves se√±ales de uso. Lo √∫nico en contra es que al parecer la pantalla que le cambiaron no es original, ya que en las configuraciones del dispositivo me lanza una alerta dici√©ndome que la pantalla no es original o no est√° bien instalada, por lo dem√°s el dispositivo fue entregado como se anuncia."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came earlier than expected, I was excited to get it, didn't want to go out of town without a phone, so when it arrived early, I was happy...until I took the phone to my carrier to put a new sim card in it, that's when the sim card was rejected because the phone was not unlock or fully unlocked.Also, the iPhone did not look like the iPhone 11 Pro Max I bought, it looks smaller and not the size of the actual phone in the picture, the was nothing in the unmarked box the phone was in to even indicate that it was actually an iPhone 11 Pro Max they sent me.Am very disappointed, cause now I still don't have a phone...but I also have to go out of town without a phone, I tried to request a quick replacement since am travelling in one day, but they refuse and stated that I have to return the phone, then they will give me a refund but not another phone...SMFH!! So, I got the phone today and return it today. Now am waiting for my refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect shape. The best experience buying refurbished phones, especially iPhones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered a renewed premium iPhone. Which I inspected in excellent condition as described but, the iPhone had many scratches around the edges.Phone is being returned"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I knew I was getting a renewed phone and couldn't expect a perfect phone but when it got here I noticed various scratches on the glass front screen and was wondering whether to return it or not. Fortunately nothing else was wrong with the phone, the camera lens was clean, the phone wasn't locked, the battery health was at around 95%. I decided to look for a glass screen protector and that solved the scratched screen as the new protector makes the scratches underneath not too noticeable. There have been no other problems since then and I am pleased with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn‚Äôt come in the apple box and no apple sticker but the phone came crispy and it only has one thing wrong with it but it‚Äôs cool"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I loveddddd this product!The price was great and I only found a few scratches on the bottom of the phone. They‚Äôre barely noticeable and can be covered by any case. Even with this, the phone was in almost brand new condition with 80% battery charge and a super clear screen! Super happy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is good, has great battery life and It arrived very fast. The only thing is that it has a few signs of wear. It‚Äôs not a big deal though."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs a pretty good phone. Great quality when it comes to aesthetics. Battery is great too. However I have been facing a couple of problems recently. One problem is that it tends to get hot when browsing the web. The other problem is network connectivity. The Wi-Fi and the cellular data randomly cuts out for a random period of time. Hopeful the last one was just some fluke because I haven‚Äôt experienced it again after the first few times."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything has worked well so far on this I-Phone (after downloading my info from I-cloud) ... except ...! A warning that the phone itself is displaying (I have attached an image) saying that it's unable to determine if the display is a genuine Apple part... ! I am afraid this will give me problems later on ...!Is anybody else having this problem?? Can anybody from this company give me customer support?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cracks on front, speaker doesn‚Äôt work right constantly hangs up and no one can hear you on it. I was surprised to see it didn‚Äôt work as expected I was hoping it would"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had this phone for over 6 months. There‚Äôs never been a problem with the phone. The only thing is that the iCloud storage is not sufficient and you will most likely have to pay for GB every month. It recognizes my face even in the dark. The battery lasts longer than a day if I‚Äôm not on it streaming. It charges really quickly. My phone hasn‚Äôt overheated at all. Although when it‚Äôs charging I don‚Äôt get on my phone. If connecting aux cord, you need adapter cause box doesn't come with one. Camera quality is good especially if you‚Äôre switching from android."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Woudl buy again. Love making payments."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôd recommend buying an Amazon Renewed phone and will buy one again in the future. It‚Äôs like a new phone! It‚Äôs much faster than my iPhone 8 Plus. I just won‚Äôt spend $1,099 on the newest phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max) from Apple and this is a great option to upgrade to a ‚Äúnew‚Äù phone! Plus, I bought the two year insurance on it in case something happens."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my iPhone 11 p r o max I was worried about buying a reconditioned iPhone like new well it is like new I bought it sold and shipped from Amazon very happy with it ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my review of the 512GB iPhone 11 Pro Max from Buyspry. I got this phone exactly 3 days ago.Your mileage may vary since these are refurbished phones however I did do some digging on this company and the seller had a great eBay reputation and no dings on BBB so I decided for this price and the Amazon backed 90 day money back, I had nothing to lose. I personally didn‚Äôt care if this phone came with a few scratches and nicks to the body, it would be going in a case anyway. The phone however arrived in a nice little box and procreated very well. The presentation was very decent. The phone was in immaculate condition and I couldn‚Äôt really find anything wrong aesthetically. The shipping did take a week but I‚Äôll chalk that up to amazons storehouse and the recent icy weather. During my 3 days of use I have noticed no abnormalities and everything functions great. If there is a downside it‚Äôs the battery life. It‚Äôs at 90%. Obviously I would want it to be at 100% but at this price I‚Äôll gladly take it. If you look at amazons refurbishing details it also lets you know that the battery‚Äôs are only guranteed to be over 80% life, so that is something to note, however battery‚Äôs aren‚Äôt too expensive and since this is an upgrade over my iPhone X even at 10% less battery life it still lasts several hours more easily. Overall I‚Äôm extremely pleased with my purchase and am so glad I got this for this price. Hope someone finds this info useful"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good aspect, signs of usage and 87% battery health"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my (like) new iPhone. I did a lot of research looking for the best deal and this was a pretty good. I‚Äôve had this phone for a few months now and haven‚Äôt had any problems. The battery life is great! I recommend this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery wasn‚Äôt replaced in service mode excellent cosmetic,but old battery"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in excellent condition. Would not recognize that it is renewed. No scratches. Nothing. Worth the dollars."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular funciona regularmente bien, el sensor de proximidad no estaba funcionando bien pero no era mayor problema‚Ä¶. La bater√≠a estaba consumida pero definitivamente creo es la mejor bater√≠a que hecho iPhone dura todoooo el d√≠a, no recomiendo celulares usados por ese precio deber√≠an costar menos ya que siempre viene con problemas los cuales result caro solucionarlos al menos en Ecuador"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was really excited about receiving this phone as it‚Äôs my first upgrade in 6 years. Everything from the condition of the phone to installation was great, until I checked the battery‚Äôs health and found out that it wasn‚Äôt a genuine Apple battery installed. On top of that, the phone became extremely hot as I was charging it. I‚Äôm giving this 2 stars because at least the phone arrived in pristine condition, which makes this even more disappointing. Minus 3 stars because of the aftermarket battery that was installed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone came earlier than I expected and with excellent working condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was somewhat nervous about buying a used iPhone, but could not justify the price of a new one. The 11 is the last major upgrade -- new chip, pro max, etc. Improvements to the later models are only incremental. So it was the perfect choice for me. I bought mine from Amazon because -- Amazon. And I opted for the renewed premium model. Mine came without a scratch anywhere and 90% on the battery. I am a happy camper."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone thinking it is a dual sim card as I had read to have a special sim card tray to hold two sim cards but what I got is BOT a dual dim mobile!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo el telefono esta exelente desbloqueado y trabaja bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Coming from an 11, my daughter wanted an upgrade and I convinced her to go for this 11 pro max and opt. for the higher storage (256gb). It was worth paying for the expedited shipping, the phone arrived in immaculate condition the battery health was EXCELLENT. Overall between the upgrade and almost new condition of the phone my daughter couldn‚Äôt be happier. She wanted the 13 pro max but at 1.5k at the time, this was a happy medium half the price and 256gb, lovely large screen. Overall EXCELLENT."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far this one is a very good phone. Everything looks good. It updated with no problem, battery health is ok 80% not to bad wont be long and I'll need a new battery. That is one o the down falls in buying a ""renewed"" phone. All and all not a bad deal, the seller is other problem!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone arrived quickly and it is as described. It looks to be in excellent condition other than the battery life. üôÇ"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this as a gift for my best friend. Her old phone was having major issues, and I was growing frustrated trying to converse with her. She lives in Hawaii, and I live in Oregon, so it is essential that we have a reliable means of communicating. Being an Android user, I had to do a bit of research. This was far and away the better reviewed of the Apple products. When she got the phone (and, according to her, the shock of her life), she was thrilled. The phone has been amazing for her on so many levels. Not only are our conversations FAR less problematic, but she has found the phone's features indispensable for her work during this Covid-19 situation. As a speech pathologist working for the school system, she is having to do much of her client work online. She said the new phone has saved her tons of time and effort lugging a laptop around. Also, she is enthralled with the functionality related to standard private usage. I keep realizing that our phones today are basically more functional computer systems than the first computer I bought back in the mid-eighties. So, all-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase. Plus, my friend owes me for life. So, there's that, too. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone must‚Äôve experienced water damage. Not loud. Can‚Äôt hear on the phone. Trying to get in contact with the seller to fix the issue‚Ä¶ [88% battery life] Still waiting on my refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update with 2nd purchase: 9/6/22These refurbished are more likely miss than hit. The second time around, the battery capacity is even lower, at 83%. The battery lost 1-2% while I was browsing the settings. It's an indicator that this battery is done as it's already in its 500th power cycle. Since these 11s are 3 year old now, I think it will be very hard to get one with more than 90% battery capacity. Unless you go for the premium refurbished. However, if someone goes that route, why not buy straight from Apple? Regular Refurbished (not Premium) here need to be at least $250 lower than Apple in order to be justified buying here. Again, I think the regular 80% battery capacity guaranteed is junk to begin with.1st Purchase:80% guaranteed really mean nothing because when the battery reached 80% capacity, it already toasted. Mine came with 87%. I bough it to replace the 7 Plus I bought brand new almost 6 years ago. The 7 Plus still has 85%. This 11 Pro Max is only 2 year old and only has 87%. Not really an improvement in term of battery life. Plus, at some point last year, it was damaged and the screen(s) got replaced. Yes, it is still within the terms set by Amazon for renewed products. However, if you got something like I did, you would have to spent a bit more to get the battery replaced and hoping that nothing else is wrong with the phone down the line. A couple years ago and before the premium renewed line, Amazon renewed was more of a sure thing. Now, it is a luck of draw. You may get something that was gently used or heavily used like mine. $600 for a heavily used phone, not worth it. May be better to spent a little more and get it straight from Apple (12 Pro Max for $200 more, came with brand new battery and shell, plus 1 year warranty same as brand new)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone says that the parts used to fix what I assume was a bad battery and a broken display screen are not genuine apple parts. It was a bit annoying for the first week or so because the notification wouldn‚Äôt clear and it seemed like every time I unlocked it it would take me to settings. Now it‚Äôs okay I just can‚Äôt see the battery health. I haven‚Äôt looked into how much it is going to be to fix this issue."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bateria al 94% de vida √∫til, sin uno solo rasgu√±o, parece nuevo, lo √∫nico que no me dej√≥ por completo feliz es el cargador con el que viene, no es original ellos son claros en eso, pero es de muy mala calidad por el precio que se paga y por ser Premium deber√≠an incluir un cargador de mejor calidad. Pero el tel√©fono espec√≠ficamente est√° perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was definitely a good purchase I 10/10 recommended was kind of Effie about it because it‚Äôs from Amazon but the battery life is awesome came charged and in very good condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone ear speaker is super quiet. Everything else works fine. Have tried everything to remedy and still not loud enough to have a conversation. Not happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Amazon you have to do better with verifying and certifying an apple product. You have to be so certain that this product is unlocked because it wasn‚Äôt unlocked when I received it and I had took the phone to verify it wasn‚Äôt going to be back log with anyone information. Turns out they had some information about who had this phone before I did but it was briefly in someone‚Äôs possession for those three days. So I wouldn‚Äôt really cold as a renewal product but more like a refurbish product. The iPhone does not come with its Apple box but with an after marketing box with and without the original iPhone wall charger. I decided not to use that wall charger and use my own wall chargers that have been certified by Apple. I don‚Äôt think the wall charger that comes with my device or with your device may be certified by Apple.

The storage is great to have especially for video creators like myself but the phone does perform very very well and I couldn‚Äôt complain too much about my experience dealing with Amazon and buying an Apple product open Amazon. So this should give you some insight on why you should go directly to the Apple store and buy an apple product from the Apple Store. Also you should take it to the Apple Store, to check for warranty options

Update: March 1st 2022
I have to make a shocking discovery about this device it turns out they replace the screen in the camera with third-party parts that are not certified by Apple. I took it to Apple to get a diagnostic and turns out the screen wasn‚Äôt even an apple screen. The reason why I had very suspicion about the device is how I received it. Also the screen was sometimes black out this is when I became very suspicious while playing a video game on the device. So I continue to ask Apple if they can replace the screen and they told me no. So I took it to a third-party Certified Applerepair shop that fixes iPhones correctly, not only a pay for a new screen but also paid for a new camera that was actually fixed on this device. I pretty much got scammed. I contacted Amazon and spoke to several people about this incident"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect for the price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular lleg√≥ en buen estado f√≠sico, pero creo con algunos defectos m√≠nimos como el altavoz"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I live in Texas and this phone was in NY when we purchased it. It arrived to us the day after we purchased it. I was amazed at how fast this phone made it to my house! Thank you! The phone itself is in great condition but there‚Äôs ton‚Äôs of scratches on the front glass, so I‚Äôll be replacing the front glass but other than that, I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase! I was so nervous to by refurnished, but we will definitely go this route again. My phone stays charged at 100 percent, and everything was as the Seller said it would be. Thank you!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bout this phone from last year July and since then I‚Äôve had no problems, it‚Äôs just like buying a new phone without the same cost"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not complaining because I appreciate the phone being available at a decent price. However, I‚Äôm a little annoyed that the battery health is at 85%. I should have done a little more research before I made my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition pf the phone is great no deep scratches on the screen only small ones from light use battery came at 95% capacity 4 stars mainly because the charger and block that came with it are on the cheaper end but overall no complaints"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone with no issues. The only way I can even tell it‚Äôs been used is a very slight, about 1cm short scratch on the back. Battery life is excellent, camera is excellent, speakers and sound quality are great, it‚Äôs basically a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs what it says it is but I honestly thought for the price it would be better. The FaceID doesn‚Äôt work. I even updated to the latest os, which apple said should‚Äôve solved the issue, it didn‚Äôt. There are deep scratches in the surface which they hid rather well at first glance with this heavy, bulky screen protector that was also warped. Some minor scratches and dings on the sides/corners. That‚Äôs to be expected with a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù iPhone. Everything else works fine. The charging seems ok even though it was NOT at 80% when it arrived. It was at 30%. To summarize‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a roulette & It‚Äôs better than my shattered 8 plus."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone seemed like it came straight from apple and was new I choice normal Renee‚Äôs and got what seems like a premium renewed phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despite seeing so nasty reviews I decided why not I bought it with very low expectations upon receiving the device it was in surprisingly good condition only imperfection was a small hairline on the screen but its hardly visible storage is as requested and battery health is 91% phone has been working well since only one time the phone shut of unexpectedly but hasn‚Äôt done it since overall im satisfied"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in excellent condition. I‚Äôm so glad I went with the renewed premium and not regular renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone 11 Pro Max arrived one day early. Excellent condition. Set up was a breeze. Would definitely buy from again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really love the phone. No scratches and cracks. Face recognition 10/10. Battery life, not really what I expected (84%) but overall, one of my best cellphone purchases on Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm actually pretty shocked that for a refurbished phone that the quality is so good. Looks brand new besides a few very minor scratches. Giving 4 stars only because one of the speakers on the bottom don‚Äôt work but it‚Äôs not really the end of the world. All in all a pretty decent phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm loving the phone. Takes amazing photos. With 256GB storage I can store all my videos and photos without worrying about space! Love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything seems to be great. The only issue was it wasn't very clean. The upper speaker was filthy. But after a little cleaning all and all just like new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Well I have to say that I was worried about ordering a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone from Amazon. A third party seller nonetheless, I am extremely surprised at the amazing condition the phone came in. It showed up on time, packaged very well, No damage, charger and original box included, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The phone is working flawlessly soFar. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything to complain about. For Amazon shoppers that might as well be a miracle. O-M Wireless really went above and beyond my expectations. It came with a 91% capacity battery, It was sent with a very thick and durable screen protector. (Would recommend buying a thinner one for every day use) sent second day air, they had the color and carrier I wanted and it was a better price than I could find any where else. Not a single noticeable scratch or defect than can been seen with just my eyes. Pairs flawlessly, camera is good, set up with my carrier by simply switching SIM cards from my old phone to new one. Was done in 10 minutes."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I trusted Amazon as that is whom I purchased this iPhone from. It came with a warranty and the support that was needed was great! I am glad I made the choice to buy this way."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect, no scratches or anything. Just what I wanted!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was full of problems and a terrible disappointment initially. I debated returning it, then performed a factory reset and now have a wonderful phone at a greatly reduced price. Since this phone is used extensively in every way possible, I‚Äôm extremely grateful for such a good produce! Others even use my phone to take important pictures because the quality is so enhanced. The battery life is very good giving me at least 21 hours of use before needing a charge. Face recognition, the ability to swish type, and the speed of flipping through apps all contribute toward saving valuable time. In all, this was an excellent purchase at a much more reasonable price than what I‚Äôd have paid for the same phone brand new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Jealous the price is lower now after spending 667 on this phone but I really needed an upgrade and love this phone so much. Has no dings, scratches, NOTHING!!!! Only thing is I had this phone for a week and already twice this phone will restart over and over again by itself sometimes."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No comment working great my sister love it üòç"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would of been very happy with this purchase if the camera worked. You could hear and feel the camera / microphone / vibration all tweaking. Battery was at 85% which is decent for a refurbished I phone and scree and case were in get shape."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone is the best iPhone that I ever owned, I love the Face ID it‚Äôs very fast and battery life is awesome since that this is my first ever iPhone that I bought from Amazon and it‚Äôs fantastic. I bought the renewed premium that says 90% or higher mine came with 99% battery heath and no scratches on the screen the is like brand new out of the box I would definitely recommend buying a iPhone on Amazon well worth it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased an Renew Premium iPhone 11 Pro Max 256gb, and unfortunately it did not come with the promised 90% battery capacity. I contacted customer service and they made everything right. They gave me two options, one to return the device, and the other to be partially refunded since the device did not meet the requirements for being premium renewed. I kept the device and accepted the refund, and I‚Äôm glad I did. Everything else about the phone is amazing, and I‚Äôm very happy with it! Awesome customer service! This is the 3rd device I‚Äôve ordered, and I would recommend this option to anyone looking to save some money while still getting a great phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve bought 3 of the midnight green versions and have not been disappointed, especially for the price, i must recommend. If you‚Äôre having services issues just go to your carrier and they will get it straight. I had to take all 3 to my provider, even though they are unlocked, very quick and easy. You won‚Äôt find a better deal than this, and i can confirm they work on overseas carriers once you pop that SIM card in. Pull the trigger on this while you can!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone in excellent condition like new. So far everything works fine and updated. Great purchase for price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect renewed phone came with no stratches or scuffs functions properly and came with a good charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have been using it for about 1 month now and the phone looks and works like a brand new phone. However, i do have this small issue where at random times the wifi doesnt work. Its not a huge issue because its very rear ( maybe once a week) and it only goes down for a few seconds. I have tried on other wifi access points all over the city and my neighborhood and i have experienced this on some of them as well so i know its not my wifi. I have my other phone with me and it never goes down.But other than that, i am happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs always a skeptical decision to buy refurbished anything but this was an amazing product and I could not find a single fault with the cosmetics of the phone.When I got the phone I had to factory reset it as it was not done. Upon turning the phone on I didn‚Äôt even have to go through the setup mode and someone else‚Äôs iCloud was attached to the phone. That was worrisome at first but a simple factory reset solved that problem.I would recommend this phone.Be sure to ship it to the right address because the shipper will not change anything once the package is shipped. They put restrictions on the package where nothing could be changed and honestly if it weren‚Äôt for the FedEx delivered I would‚Äôve had to wait for it to return to the shipper and get a refund. The FedEx driver realized I had moved and left the package at my new address."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It have a small chip but it was really hard to spot in normal conditions and everything else was working perfectly. It was overall a great deal."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got this phone it would not turn it‚Äôll turn back on every second and make phone hot I had to figure it how to turn it off and the battery life it‚Äôs not good but it‚Äôs also not bad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall Phone works well, no 5g like my Samsung A71, Wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt maintain strong connection like my A71 at same distance from router.Cosmetics of the phone- arrived with a screen protector pre-installed, when I removed it I found a deep scratch and permanent scuff on the glass. Back of phone shows wear from previous owners case especially around cameras and the camera rings have some scratches and a couple deep grooved nicks. Overall not exactly ‚Äúlike new‚Äù as promised by Amazon renew physical description‚Ä¶probably will return"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery Life Is At 87% So It Dies Faster Than My Family Members Phones. Basically Doesn‚Äôt Last As Long As It Should. Regardless Great Unlocked Phone in Really Good Condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got this phone when my old one crapped out. It is only a couple of generations old and the price is excellent. The phone is like brand new. The battery life is excellent. Face ID works great. Great screen! All in all it is a great phone! I have no regrets whatsoever about buying it! I love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno, Justo por el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelent condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came with a noticeable scratch on the screen but everything else is fine its still beautiful but I probably would recommend getting renewed premium üò¨"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","this phone is open to all carriers which was wonderful. Fully unlocked and easy to set up! I was afraid to order at first but I'm glad I did. Oh and its a real apple phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno sin problemas como nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La bater√≠a es mala, dura muy poco, por lo dem√°s todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When they sell on Amazon renew products they should look into it closely, so I purchased this iPhone from a seller named BUYSPRY and the phone did look good it didn't have scratches or blemishes on the edges or on the back of the phone but there was a tempered glass covering the front screen when I remove the temper glass there were light blemishes and fine hairline scratches on the screen surface it's not noticeable when you put on the tempered glass which I do on my phone to protect it from scratches but when you remove it it is noticeable so the product isn't really renew when there are scratches on the phone screen I would give it a b+. I think Amazon and their resellers need to evaluate and understand when using the term renewed and refurbished because this phone wasn't renewed it felt more like refurbished."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this phone was a good buy. It did have a one inch scratch at the top of the screen and battery capacity was at 94%. In my opinion all ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phones should come with a new battery. How can it be ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù if nothing has been done to it. This phone was basically half price so I am completely satisfied. I would definitely purchase again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a very beautiful iPhone. It looks brand new. Doesn‚Äôt have a single scratch. Came with a charging brick and cord. Fully unlocked. Downloaded information from my other phone perfectly.UPDATE: had to update. I still LOVE this phone. It‚Äôs beautiful and sleek and works perfect. The battery is strong. It never overheats. It never glitches. There was not one single scratch on it when I received it. It feels so beautiful in the hands. The thickness is beautiful and solid. It‚Äôs so much larger than the iPhone 11. It‚Äôs identically as beautiful as the new iPhone 12. This was a good purchase. I‚Äôm very happy with it. I was initially apprehensive about investing in an iPhone through amazon. It‚Äôs my first Amazon Phone purchase. I‚Äôm glad I took the leap. NEW UPDATE: STILL IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE. IT STILL WORKS PERFECT. NEVER GLITCHES OR OVERHEATS. IT‚ÄôS STILL SO BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. GREAT LEAP OF FAITH. I FEEL LIKE I GOT A BRAND NEW PHONE."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It so much thing wrong with this phone I HATE IT LIKE WHY????? Never ordering a phone off Amazon again ! üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I went from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I am absolutely in love with this phone. The camera is awesome and takes great pictures. Face recognition works great; it recognizes my face with my sunglasses on. The battery lasts longer than the iPhone 7 Plus."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","very god, but the screen like a little bad, touchscreen, but its god"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max offers rock solid WiFi performance and reliable cell service in weak signal areas, unlike the reconditioned iPhone XS Max that it replaced. After my other seller's tech support staff exhausted all possible solutions for the older phone's performance issues, I decided to return that phone and upgrade to the 11 Pro Max.Not certain whether my previous phone's problems had been caused by the XS Max itself or by some combination of the apps I had installed, I took a chance and set my new phone up from a back up of the previous phone. The difference was immediately obvious; in an area where the XS Max showed one bar of signal strength on a good day and no signal most of the time, I now have two and sometimes three bars with no dropped calls. WiFi reliability has shown a similar degree of improvement.Returning the XS Max and spending the extra money for this iPhone 11 Pro Max has been one of the best decisions I've made. Even better yet, this reconditioned 11 Pro Max looks like a brand new phone, with no visible scratches, and retains 100% of its battery capacity.In short, I'm a very happy customer!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I even opened the box, it was making noise like something was playing.. it was on an auto voice thing where it would read everything on the screen.. after I get it all set up and everything it is perfect. Almost no signs of wear.. screen protector on it is perfect. Battery life is good and there is nothing wrong with it. I am glad I took the chance to buy this and it even came two days early. Very happy with this phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buena compra e inversi√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone in good condition and everything is working fine, but the price is too much, and when I returned it to Amazon they won't give me my money back until they receive the phone and I sent it 8 day's ago for $14 with ups but still delay, I'm in need for the money but I'm stuck with this stupid return policy Amazon have, iphone 11 pro max 512g for $847 sum change while u can get it for 600 sum change!!?"

I've had it close to a month now and so far so good. I was a little skeptical about ordering after reading the few negative comments concerning issues activating phone with Sprint, however, those comments are prior to T-Mobile merge. I experienced no issues whatsoever activating phone. I upgraded from 6S Plus, so just had to get use to some feature changes (i.e. taking screenshots). Overall, excellent buy!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","In great condition when I got it and still is"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","As if I bought it brand new, Great purchase‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","A lot of money for a use cellI was hoping the battery would‚Äôve lasted a lot longer and I‚Äôm still charging it halfway through the day so I‚Äôm very dissatisfied with that also looking forward to this new camera gonna be so much better I have not noticed a difference from the iPhone X"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mine had scratches on it and battery wouldn‚Äôt last long then I found out that I couldn‚Äôt talk on the speaker phone for calls. People would complain that they couldn‚Äôt hear me. Only way it worked was if I had it against my ear. Then the face recondition took a while. It says that it should come in a almost new condition but with problems like that and the money I spend it shouldn‚Äôt be like that"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Iphone like brand new. Battery 95%, no scratches or damage's. Charger not original but new and works well. The only sad thing is the key to remove sim card wasn‚Äôt came in the box. But i recomend buy Renewed Premium. It worth the money spent."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works and easy to get connected to my own service. No problems at all with my phone and I have never had a problem buying phones on Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery health is inferior to a normal iPhone 11 Pro Max. This phone 1-2 hours to charge, and has a very low active usage life (4-5 hours screen time). This phone‚Äôs unauthentic apple battery is subpar at best."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is like a brand new phone. No scratches or defects at all. I genuinely appreciate the way they boxed it up. It was like opening a new phone. Battery life is phenomenal. Really guys you would never know this was refurbished."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","tuve dudas al comprarlo pero, una lo tuve en mis manos y lo utilice me di cuenta que estaba en perfecto estado.full recomendado y agradecido con el vendedor por tener buena calidad en sus productos.resaltar que el paquete solo demoro 5 d√≠as en llegar USA a Panam√°."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was a bit nervous at first buying this but the phone quality is absolutely amazing‚Ä¶.. came with 100% battery ‚Ä¶. No scratches and everything was to my liking"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cosmetically it is a 7/10, came in VERY dirty, dirt in the camera and port, after cleaning looks ok, everything works fine BUT the speakers are blown out, everything sounds so bad, and due to work i cant afford to not have a phone for a week so i‚Äôll just buy the bullet on this but do beware."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant at first about buying this iPhone but I am so glad I did ! It‚Äôs perfect ;) it came way sooner than expected & it was well packaged! The iPhone is in perfect condition, no scratches & it also had a screen protector on it ! I highly recommend buying it , you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Price point was amazing & just what I was looking for. Phone came in like new condition & was not only at 75% battery but also had a screen protector already installed for me. Came on time with a charger & plug & works amazingly. Would definitely look to this seller for my next purchase of a renewed phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","However the add stated it would be above 80% they should replace the battery if it‚Äôs in the lower 80s just because these are supposed to be renewed not used heavily"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I prefer my iPhone 6. When I do a search using iPhone 11 Pro Max the results return in small print, many times query doesn‚Äôt return results at all. I am glad I kept my iPhone 6 so that I can use it for back up to search and read pages the iPhone 11 Pro Max doesn‚Äôt seem to respond to. Same search but either wrong results or no response. Also, some pages are blocked so I have to use my iPhone 6 to get results. Setting seem ok but for some reason the iPhone 11 Pro Max performs below par."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received my refurbished iPhone 11 Pro Max and the phone came flawless.. I was nervous about buying a refurbished phone off Amazon but definitely met my expectations and more.. it looks brand new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered 2 phones one for me and one for my son. Neither one of us have had any problems. Phones showed up in perfect shape and we had no problems activating them. We are with straight talk. Would definitely order from this seller again Came with phone , charger and, sd card remover"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I personally was really scared spending this much money on the phone especially after purchasing it and going on here to read comments. Stressed me out for a few days waiting for the phone because a lot of negative reviews but so far so so good. I have had the phone for 2 months now and works perfectly fine do not let the comments fool you i will recommend this to anyone to get if needing a phone the vendor is fine and delivery was smooth got here quick and battery life is perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Yo lo compr√© para cambiar de tel√©fonos y para tener uno mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy a renewed phone due to some reviews here, but I decided to give it a try and I‚Äôm happy I did.The phone is in good condition, no cosmetic damage and battery is just as described: 85%, so it lasts on me a day with low usage (two if I‚Äôm at home), but I need to charge it during the day if I‚Äôm using extensively. Overall I‚Äôm really happy for this."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","bad battery"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The delivery was very quick. It looks great and so far works very well. I would order from this supplier any time and recommend him. Many thanks..I. Marlow"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ completo y muy n√≠tido. Volver√≠a a comprar a BuySpry.. compre en otra tienda y no llego completo.. BuySpry lo mejor.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone didn‚Äôt even seem refurbished seems brand new heck I‚Äôm even using it while typing this lol there were no scratches on screen, battery health was at 100 even after it recalibrated from more usage, and it came within a timely matter I think a day early if I‚Äôm not mistaken"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ok good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is in very good condition in the outside but only have 80% of Health on batery and when I‚Äôm on pictures on a call or video call it goes like if is dead for am1 minute and hang out the FaceTime calls plenty of time I‚Äôm gonna wait 3 more days if this keep happening I‚Äôm gonna return it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought this iPhone 11 Pro Max to replace my broken iPhone XS Max. Received the phone in 2 days and was pleased upon opening the package to find the phone in mind condition! Battery was at 82% which was not so great, but was willing to overlook it as the phone was in excellent condition with not a single scratch or dent. However, when I went to my phone carrier to set up my new phone, I was told they could not activate it! Apparently the phone was not a clean IEM and could not be activated. My carrier even made several phone calls but to no avail! Phone could not be activated and basically was a dead paper weight!I was very unhappy because of my wasted time and money! Then it I had to sent it back to Amazon for a refund and it took over 2 weeks to get my money refunded! Do not waste your time and effort on a Amazon renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max. I should have listened to the many bad reviews for this phone but I was willing to take a chance and unfortunately got a bad deal!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is decent for 615 when I got it on sale. Now it went back up to 663. Description says no defects when viewed at arms length. Yeah, if you're Helen Keller. It's a few scratches and at various areas on the screen. However it is superficial and isn't deep grooves and hides well under a screen protector. But the screen protector provided is cheap, the sides doesn't stick as you can see in the pic. I don't want to return it, risk getting another scratched up one for the higher price. Plus the back and camera is pristine, guess the previous owner kept it in a case. Also the battery is at 97% health so for 615 plus 5 bucks for a case and screen protector to hide the superficial srcratches...it's a decent buy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice picture"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery life is why it love it.Also all the updated items.Great phone!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","1st experience with an Amazon renewed product. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Looks and functions as brand new!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Working perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Product was a gift. Recipient is happy with gift"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall good physical condition. Some dirt build up at speakers and earpiece. I was expecting battery to be new or better than 80% of the original capacity. Came with screen protector, not sure if it is to hide scratches on actual screen or just as an extra. Have not taken it out yet."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono est√©ticamente est√° bien solo unos rasgu√±os en la pantalla, el cargador no funcion√≥ por eso es que le doy baja calificaci√≥n pienso que por el precio pudo haber estado mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works great, face recognition works wonderfully, battery life lasts me all day sometimes have to charge it once during the day, storage capacity is perfect I have space for all my pictures and applications with tons of space leftover"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todas las funciones tal cual un equipo nuevo, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 86% teniendo en b cuenta el tipo de equipo est√°s comprando a√∫n le queda una vida √∫til de a√±os !!! No me arrepiento de esta compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came good just that it had scratches on the screen"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This product came with only three small scratches. The battery life was only at 85 percent, so not that great, but still a great product and delivery."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn‚Äôt like some part of my camera front camera photos came out distorted like it wasn‚Äôt 12megapixel in front, had to compare with other peoples phones to know mine had some issue apart from that everything was okay"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the iphone 11 pro max in gold and it is in very good condition. works really well. everything is fine just has a few minor scratches on the screen which is bearable but would receive a 5/5 if they weren‚Äôt there. i also ordered the iphone 11 pro in gold with the same feature (256 gb) and it had no scratches at all. so compared to this phone, the physical condition is better on the 11 pro. other than the small minor scratches, everything works well as if i just bought it at an apple store!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It works as expected, arrived timely. NowI purchased a cover for it, added a finger holder, so it‚Äôs perfectUse it every day for a phone, texting, social media, brain games and learning."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","my first time buying an iPhone from Amazon, at first I felt a little skeptical because what if the phone comes out to be scratchy/ battery condition is bad and etc. but when I got the packaged phone works well, the battery health was at 93% which was fine for me because the description said it will be 80% and above. It came with a charger as well, I've been reading about these reviews here saying the charger is not the original one from apple, hello read caption/ product first before buying. they gave me everything that they stated in the bio. PHONE WORKS WELL AND WORKS AS BRAND NEW FROM APPLE STORE!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS PRICE ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS 256GB.. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. :)) THANK YOU!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve only had it for 3 days so this review might be a little premature, but so far so good. My review is only about the phone itself because the packaging is not the original and the charger is aftermarket, but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was really good for this phone. Face recognition and the actual appearance of the phone are 5 stars, no dents or scratches absolutely nowhere on the screen or bezel, I am using ultra mobile so I went for the Tmobile phone since they‚Äôre the same network and it worked just fine as soon as I introduced the sim card, no icloud issues whatsoever which has happened before on other iphones from other sellers. I‚Äôm gonna give you guys 4.5 stars just for the mere reason of the packaging and the charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product that came as described. Only minor issues: battery life is 87% and there is a small scratch on the screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ bien se ve algo bien ya se ve su uso excesivo con bater√≠a en un 89% creo ya muy usado para que valga m√°s de 700$ pero funciona perfecto hoy lo active a la l√≠nea todo bien lo malo que no haga realidad la cuenta de la Apple store intente hacer una nueva con mi otro correo electr√≥nico de igual forma no agarra el c√≥digo de seguridad.. Si no puedo hacer la cuenta de la tienda de Apple tendr√© que regresarlo y espero que a si como toman el dinero a si sea de vuelto a mi cuenta Gracias üò°"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Incredible deal! Came with 100 percent battery life! This iPhone takes several holes to even drain down from 90% let alone when it‚Äôs still rocking on 1% all night! Got a 30 watt charger to go with it, it seems it draws between 18 and 22 watts? So the 30watts is extra headroom versus the 18watt max from Apple. This refurbished unit came with a third party charger and cables as expected. It is indeed the right color and storage capacity. Flawless, not a single scratch and a clean imei. The size is perfect, about the same, but a little wider than the Galaxy Note9 I upgraded from. Thank you BuySPRY for the perfect iPhone‚Äôs! My device shipped with 13.4.1 and didn‚Äôt force me to upgrade while setting up so I was able to cough cough run some stuff on it if you know what I mean ;)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks and works great"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I felt so ripped off but it‚Äôs is what it‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not the type of person to judge a product of some bad reviews but I should have stuck by it and not purchase the phone cause what is this, should have know better cause the phone came on 1% smh"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No ear volume great testing. Now it‚Äôs call apple we will send another if they ok it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Screen was lifted on edges and would not respond to touch well. Had to tap several times to get it to work."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba algo preocupada x q no sab√≠a en q condiciones llegar√≠a el iPhone 11 Pro Max, pero me siento muy feliz, llego en perfecta condiciones f√≠sica y de funcionamiento, ni un solo rasgu√±o, aparte llego dos d√≠as antes de lo programado, realmente me siento muy satisfecha con el producto y la oportunidad"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was packaged good and with care. I asked for a space grey 64gb, but gave me a 256gb midnight green.Which is way better. Came with a 90 percent battery which meets. Everything works it perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Shipping was exceptionally quick, I bought this phone for my dad‚Äôs birthday at the last minute and it arrived the night before. My dad upgraded from a 6 Plus to this phone and he loves it. Works just like a brand new phone and all of his information transferred over seamlessly."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got the Amazon Premium refurb, but hopefully I won‚Äôt need to use it, and it may seem like I won‚Äôt need to"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The negative comments almost put me off but this phone is literally amazing so if you‚Äôre thinking of doing it please do it. Could be a hit or miss but you might hit so do it. Literally NO scratches or cracks. Nothing"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was pretty nervous to spend this much for a phone that was refurbished (technically) but I am so glad I did! It came in on time, all packed up nice and neat. It was charged and only had one little scratch on the top left camera frame (the silver ring around the actual lens, therefore doesn‚Äôt affect camera at all). Everything works great, speakers sound amazing, camera is the absolute best quality, and the battery can last me all day if I forgot to put it on charge the night before. It came in exactly as described and I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I also bought a glass screen protector and spiegen case for the best protection."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased this certified renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max 256GB to replace my old iPhone 7 because I didn't want to buy iPhone 12 Pro with 5G technology that is still developing yet. Received this phone with a few minor scratches around the rim and the scratch on the screen is not noticeable after putting screen protector. Battery capacity is 100%!! I have been testing a lot of functions (playing video game, watching YouTube video, FaceTime with families overseas, virtual office meeting via zoom and MS team, pairing with Apple Watch etc.), no freeze or any issues so far. The battery lost only 4% yesterday morning when pairing with Apple Watch (with bluetooth on) and joining virtual office meeting via zoom. It is amazing! OVERALL, IT IS A GREAT RENEWED PHONE with the price paid!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The hook of Amazon Renewal was to buy a used product that looks and functions like new. At a lower price and save the planet at the same time. Nice marketing I fell for it. Twice! I bought a iPhone 11 ProMax from BuySpry. The first phone had a single deep scratch on the bottom left. It also had metal damage on the bottom left from it being dropped by previous owner. There were also numerous very visible scratches all over the screen. How very disappointing for a phone that was marketed as ‚Äòrenewed‚Äô and called Grade A refurb. Okay. Chalk it up to lemon. I returned it. And ordered another. Bad omen. The second phone box was used. The seal was broken and clearly I just got someone‚Äôs return. WTH. The second one was slightly less bad but not acceptable. . It had a actual chip in the LCD screen along with several noticeable scratches. Wow. This was not renewed to like new and not grade A as pitched. I returned this one as well. The bad I already told you. The good. The first phone had 100% battery health so clearly it was replaced. Don‚Äôt know about the second phone. Seeing a chip in the lcd. I didn‚Äôt even bother to power it up. I returned it the same day in disappointment. Both phones had screen protectors. I think to hide the scratches more than as protection for the second user if I may be cynical. Perhaps I got two bad phones and I am the exception. Perhaps it‚Äôs the seller BuySpry. And other companies do a better job? I do not know but I don‚Äôt think I will be going to fall for Amazon used marketing for a long while."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got what would seem to be a brand new phone. 11max pro. Full battery. Perfect all the way around. Sweet."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","What I loved about this phone ultimately is that it came in as if I purchased it brand new. This phone had no problems with scratches, bumps, or any problems with lagging.However, the one downside to this phone was the battery. The battery dies starts to drain within hours, and I need to charge it in the middle of the day. It just does not last long for the day.But overall, great quality of the camera, lots of storage, and I enjoy it overall."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was meant to be a Christmas present. First phone didn‚Äôt arrive, second was wrapped as a present. Receiver spent time loading the older phone backup just to realize the phone speaker wasn‚Äôt working. The sound was almost inaudible and very fainted (even when increasing the volume all the way up). Useless if you want to hear the phone ringing, or map directions in the car. I had to return it and order another one directly from Apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Every thing perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone a couple of months ago and it came with the screen protector and I was like that's cool. Recently, while replacing the screen guard I peel off the old one and saw that my phone screen is full of scratches and those are deep scratches and not just normal scratches. It's like somebody has must have been rigged the phone on concrete, but the smart a** seller has already put on a new screen guard to fool the customers like me. This is really a huge disappointment. It's been a more than 3 months now so I can't return it and these phones are expensive, so we are under the impression that it must be a nice product."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this is a good phone for the price they want buttt the phone did come with some scratches on it but i‚Äôm in IT tech and fixed it already but beware when ordering!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Kiss electronics NYC sent an iphone 11 pro max with a busted top speaker. Not satisfied at all. I see that they are permanently closed now so im assuming they have also sent bad products to plenty of others.üëéüëé"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers are messed up,otherwise good phone,I need someone to contact me on this"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was is great condition but for some reason it will not pair with any car radio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente celular! Muy recomendable! No tiene da√±os ni rayas! Funciona todo correctamente y vino con 93% de bater√≠a! Excelente como nuevo!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I can count the amount of reviews that I‚Äôve done. But this deserves the best review that I can post. First of all, the phone came a day early, that‚Äôs a plus up 100 for me, second, the phone came in perfect condition, no scratches, or dents whatsoever and that‚Äôs a plus 1,000. Third, the phone is compatible with my SIM card. If you‚Äôre reluctant about buying from this seller, I‚Äôll tell you that you can trust them. And the price for the condition of the phone that I received is heaven sent. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and I‚Äôm not disappointed at ALL. Thank you very much ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is fine, it's an iPhone 11 pro max as described. No noticeable defects. Curious why the refurb market is flooded with this model in this color?DOES NOT WORK ON SPRINT AS IS CLEARLY CLAIMED IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE DESCRIPTION."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is great except I can only use the speaker phone to be able to hear the other person on the call."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo OK pero la bater√≠a tiene 83% es muy poco para que lo vendan al precio que no compre"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Capacity not right"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a great deal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this for my father and he loved it. No issues at all and it has very tiny cosmetic scratch on top right of the screen. The reason why I purchased for size and storage capacity and considering to get myself one too"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I upgraded from a Iphone 8 plus to the 11 pro max and I can't not stress enough how great this phone is the battery life is so great feels like you can use the phone all day and it won't die. The display is so awesome you can really tell the difference with the oled display on the 11 compared to the 8 plus all the dark blacks look amazing. The camera quality is out of this world with the three cameras it feels like you can record movie quality videos and take stunning pictures as well. 10/10 would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy it. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition is pristine. Works well and came with 100% battery life. Very satisfied customer."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life good, face recognition good, camera lenses did fall off 3 days after I got it, connected with metro they think it was a fake iPhone with different screen and camera and flash. Did not come in original box."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs a B+ Rated phone but extremely clean! I‚Äôm impressed. Battery health is 92%."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came in great condition, the screen nor cameras have any scratches visible, but there are minor scratches along the corners and such. The phone is fast and has given me no problems so far, but I will update if need be. I would recommend to buy it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I saw that it was a refurbished phone I was a little hesitant. I have bought refurbished items before but this one is really great. The battery has a 91 percent and the unit itself looks really brand new. No scratches, no broken screen or anything else. It was refurbished by Verizon so I guess they know what they are doing. If you are thinking about a refurbished item then I recommend that you go ahead and buy it. I did and it worked out GREAT!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cuando me lleg√≥ el tel√©fono hace un mes ten√≠a un 96% en la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a , ahora tengo 92%, no s√© si es normal que haya disminuido tanto en ese lapso de tiempo. Algo que he notado es que no me llegan las notificaciones siempre, a veces si, a veces no."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase 2 of these and weeks later was on sale for over $100.00 less. Have many dents and cracks. functions ok. have many scratches and sometimes the screen freezes, I wish I can return and purchase a different one. I will not recommend it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came in a day early, was not scratched, and works great!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal and business"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price phone quality is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","everything was perfect came with a new charger ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had hella issues upon buying this phone. For one, the people who sell it are not certified to have Apple screens so I had MAJOR screen issues. My screen was even coming out by the second week of having the phone. I contacted them and they were willing to fix it but since they did not have Apple products. I decided not to send it back.. I would‚Äôve sent it back but that would‚Äôve cost me too much time. So I got it fixed at my job and now it works fine."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS SUPER SCARED OF BUYING MY IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS GOING OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR A WHILE, RIGHT AFTER BUYING IT AND JUST INCASE IT HAD AN ISSUE, I WOULD BE SCREWED. I WAS ALSO SCARED THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE TRULY UNLOCKED... HOW WRONG WAS I!!!THE PHONE IS AMAZING!! TOTALLY UNLOCKED!! LOOKS AS GOOD AS NEW! NO SCRATCHES... NO MARKS! TOTALLY BRAND NEW! NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL... I MEAN, AT ALL!! BATTERY LEVELS... ALSO PERFECT!WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE. CAN'T WAIT TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE FROM THEM."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic phone despite it has a minor imperfection on the screen. But the phone itself is fully functional. I give 4.5 out of 5 to the seller due to seller not disclosing the imperfection on the screen.This iphone 11's camera is by far worse than Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. The color is indeed not as good as Samsung. If you plan to take professional photos and videos, this iPhone is not a right choice. I am not advertising for any company, but as a professional studio, I give a fair judgement and honest opinion about Apple and Samsung."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price! Excellent condition!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! I was a bit skeptical to buy a phone online, but this Amazon refurbished iPhone is amazing. Not only is it in mint condition, but the battery life was still 96%!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the size and face recognition. I miss having the control button on the front and the battery life percentage shown, I don‚Äôt like that."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ en perfecto estado, cumpli√≥ con las expectativas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my iPhone 11 Pro Max came in a generic box with generic charger but works and looks brand new! Very happy with my purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","love it! it‚Äôs in perfect condition for me, battery could be a little better but 95% battery health is better than less than that. I was able to set it up the same day and absolutely no issue. the condition is immaculate despite the small scuffs around the border of the device that cannot be visible with a case. everything so far is perfect- lets just hope that this one doesn‚Äôt break so fast :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this seller. I have purchased 4 phones from this seller in the last two years for me and my children. The phones come brand new to be renewed. The battery is like new with 100% battery life and the phones are packaged like brand new. hey quality is as if you walked into the apple store and bought them. Worth every penny. They also operate as if they are brand new and work like butter. I love this seller. will remain a lifetime customer."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had ordered another 11 pro max from a different supplier but I had to return it cuz it wasn't working right but this one is great so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Device was pretty much new other than a few scratches on the sides of the frame. Other than that, no scratches on the screen and everything works perfectly!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Typing is difficult and frustrating as nearby characters are engaged instead of the ones needed. Care is needed to avoid sending incomplete text when typing close to the right hand side of the screen! I still like my phone and I will buy again or recommend to others."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This vendor was very prompt with responding to enquiries. The product is also outstanding. I will buy it again for sure. thanks!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our daughter bought this phone and had it less then a month. She purchased screen protectors and a case for it. She is a single parent and needed a new phone. During these times of unrest, in every way imaginable, people tend to do things they normally wouldn't do. In this case, she spent almost a thousand dollars on this IPhone 11 ProMax!! And she didn't purchase the $199 warranty figuring with the price she paid, the phone's endurance would be great. Now the saying goes-""you get what you pay for."" Well, she was entertaining her young child outside. This very expensive phone fell a short way to the ground and landed on a smaller then pea sized rock!! The bottom right side now has a small shattered hole and that part does not work. I contacted this company asking if there was any way they would help her get it fixed-pay for the screen replacement repair, send a replacement screen etc.. They were unsympathetic. Advised her to find a repair shop and have it fixed. Well, I understand there is no warranty under the circumstances, but to get a small amount of help??? We normally buy Samsung phones. We have purchased LGs. Both these brands are more durable and less money then the IPhone. I have accidentally dropped mine-LG-a few times and have had no damage done.All in all-you don't always get what you pay for. This IPhone is heavy and fragile. The customer service is unsympathetic.IPhones are nothing more then a status symbol and my daughter now regrets her purchase.Like I said, during these times of unrest, a little sympathy and help would have been appreciated."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had it for a couple of days, but its been really good. It came in really good condition, no noticeable scratches on screen or back or edges. So far happy with the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Basically a brand new phone ,96% battery life , no scratches or marks . Couldn‚Äôt be more satisfiedMajor Thumbs UpüëçüèΩ"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had two choices, renewed or premium renewed. Went with the premium renewed for a little extra cost for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and was surprised the phone looked almost brand new. Not disappointed in the purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Usually people buying these products are kind of skeptical about them and they don‚Äôt know if they will receive the full product, let alone the product being in great shape. I recently ordered this product but at first I thought it was a scam seeing the reviews so I tried to cancel my order but it was already shipped so I went with it. It arrived a few days early and it was more than I expected! Phone is in perfect condition and it came with a charger and a cable though not the original products but it still came with the phone and the phone had a screen protector added which is nice on top of 90day warranty only case anything goes wrong. Great service! (Fully unlocked, tried my current SIM card and it works!)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had my phone now for a little over 2 weeks. Cosmetically, it looked brand new. I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","For those who don't know what unlocked means, it doesn't mean it is for the verizon network. Very frustrating. I thought unlocked meant it was a legit, not stolen, phone. I guess it means that, but then it doesn't mean you can go to verizon. So the phone itself was fine and the seller was great because he took it right back, but I just don't know where you can connect it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything on this product. It works fast, and speedy. Connected to my old phone easily, and can‚Äôt wait to start using it. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to buy it. It comes with screen protector in the package and charger, with a booklet in case you wants to return the product. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíùüòãüòá‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üíù"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall the phone is good, the speak isn‚Äôt that good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I read some reviews before buying this iPhone saying that some screens were broken and scratched. My iPhone Pro Max came in a box wrapped in a bubble mailer. There was instructions for phone replacement if needed amd came with a generic cord and outlet adapter box. The phone itself was is great condition and was completely unlocked. It worked and so did the charging cord. The IPhone charged quite fast and has a reliable battery. It's not very thick, but is quite heavier than the phone I was previously using. I am personally not bothered by the weight. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is quick to respond and easy to use!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my fourth Amazon Renewed product I've purchased, and my second phone. As with the other items, this iPhone 11 Pro Max looks and works like new. The battery shows 98% health, and was shipped with a new (non original) 2.4A charger, and 3ft lightning cord. A glass screen protector came pre installed as well. My phone arrived 2 days early which was very much appreciated. I have checked all features of the phone, and everything seems to be in good working order. I feel confident ordering with Amazon's 90 day satisfaction guarantee."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was really nervous about getting a phone on here the phone arrived early has worked really good today nothing wrong with it came charged in all I just put my Sims card in it and it worked so worth it glad I done it but like I said it‚Äôs just the first day but it seems to be a good phone"

Just wish the battery was at 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is great, my wife loves it and wud not trade it for nothing."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenia un peque√±o rayon en la camara trasera y residuos de pegamento a los lados. El cargador era tipo USB . Al momento funcionando bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got my phone I loved it. It worked perfectly. Now, 3 months later, my apps keep closing randomly. I‚Äôm not saying that is because of the phone, it could be something else but I have no way of knowing. All in all, I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase and would buy again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything about it at first THE SPEAKER IS KINDA BROKEN it words but it sounds harsh and it was difficult cause for some reason it said the phone wasn‚Äôt unlocked but I took it to my carrier store and it was all better it‚Äôs a good value for you money"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm always leery of making large purchases of goods that are sight unseen, but took a chance on this phone. It arrived in nearly pristine condition. Very clean, with a minute scratch on the screen (the screen protector I put on makes it invisible). Battery life at 95%. Completely unlocked, so no issues with activating and setting it up. I purchased it from the refurbished Verizon seller. Delivery requires a signature (to avoid potential loss or theft), so make sure someone is home to receive it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","excellent service and excellent product. like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen has some sort of distortion on it and the camera has some deformities, it is jumping and it is making a weird sound when I try to use the rear camera"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly I thought it was going to come I‚Äôm broke but no everything was perfect the only thing wrong is that it came with a scratch but that‚Äôs it only one scrath"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After not being able to remove the SIM card tray and getting approved to return it, my son in law was able to remove it. He placed my SIM card in it, charged it and it charged quickly with the battery running at 87%. I have gone a whole day without having to put it on the charger. I am extremely happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent phone so far o issues. I wish for the high tag price a manual of basic features would have been included, I had to learn te hard way but I Did!
Only one issue a black tab bar like appears on the bottom and middle f the phone some times mostly when navigating the web. But that‚Äôs a programming flaw. The phone was in new like condition no scratches or defective. I am satisfied with the purchase, was expensive but worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far so good. Just not the color I ordered. I ordered green, but got white. But whatever there‚Äôs a case on it anyway."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy satisfecho por la compra, lleg√≥ en buen estado con una vida √∫til de bater√≠a de 92%, lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is heavy. It‚Äôs thick. I like it. Only thing I have a problem with is the back camera and flash light. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work and they knew it before sending it to me. Now I have to pay to get it fixed. Great phone just get it from Apple"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo est√° muy bien hasta ahorita no
he tenido ning√∫n problema"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works great and only had a few scratches around the camera."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone esta perfecto, tiene pocos detalles pero para su precio yo creo que vali√≥ la pena, estoy muy contento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has held up great. Forgot how big iPhones are better for me. Have a case and screen protector and alls good in the hood. Micro scratches on screen, but it‚Äôs used, only notice them when I HUNT for them."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had to dig lint/dirt out of the charging port with a paperclip so the cable would fit properly, but otherwise seems fine so far. Got the phone with 90% battery health. Amazon needs to check the cleanliness of that port before shipping phones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week Friday and I received it today the 2nd of December which was extra fast. The battery life is 100% which is amazing and the phone came in a really good condition. I love love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buyspry has excellent customer service and quality phones you‚Äôd swear my iPhone pro max was new! They ship with a screen protector already on . When I look for a refurbished phone again I‚Äôm going to make sure it‚Äôs buyspry as the vendor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm so glad I chose this for my upgrade! My old phone was a 6s plus and the battery on that was pretty much nonexistent. I was constantly charging but now I just charge once and I‚Äôm good to go literally all day! At first I was VERY hesitant to spend this much money, but I‚Äôm so glad I did! Great battery life, lots of storage space and it‚Äôs just an all around great phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love the pictures"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max works like new! The screen is fantastic (and even came with a complimentary screen protector!). My only qualm is that there are several (I believe I counted close to 7-8) nicks in the casing around the edges of the phone. Not terrible... and, certainly not enough for me to send back! It's used, so it's definitely to be expected... I'll hopefully get 2-3 more years out of this model!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is so perfect, it feels like a brand new one."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone I received Looks Brand New.
And came with 92% battery life‚Ä¶
Was incredibly worried because some of the comments"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 11 Pro Max has been working perfectly so far. The max. battery life is indeed 100%, and it lasts for about 2-3 days, depending on usage. The camera system is fantastic, and I love that there is a specific camera lens responsible for zooming in and out. The phone is fast, as it opens all of my apps and the web browser very quickly. Above all else, I love that the phone has plenty of storage capacity, probably more so than I will ever need. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is in need of one."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Solid choice for a new phone. It arrived quickly in mint condition. If you don‚Äôt want to be saddled with a contract, it‚Äôs very easy to set up as a prepaid att line. The only issue I‚Äôve had is with the charging cable. It‚Äôs not good. But I didn‚Äôt buy the phone for the cable, so that‚Äôs not really relevant to my thoughts on the product itself. Solid bargain all around."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my phone, but when I received it I didn‚Äôt check it thoroughly. If I use speaker phone, nobody can hear me. I just went to get it fixed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a very expensive iPhone refurbished and did not come with the straight talk SIM card, so cannot use the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So I wasn‚Äôt even able to set up facial recognition it doesn‚Äôt even work at all and when I try to put in my password it will start typing in random numbers without me even touching it and then disable my phone for one minute I went to the Apple store see if I can get it fixed and they said it was gonna cost $600 because there‚Äôs no warranty on this phone from other reviews I‚Äôve read you are probably going to get a 50-50 chance of getting a phone that actually works properly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly, I originally was skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone but based on its physical appearence and performance, Im not too sure if its just renewed or brand new. Very pleased with this purchase. I still don't believe its NOT brand new, no scratches was on it or any type of marks. Zero flaws. Only thing that was missing which is stated when purchasing was not in original package and original apple charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 8 Plus completely cracked on vacation and I needed something to be home by the time I got back so I ordered this phone and it looks brand new and it works awesome, if you‚Äôre ordering expecting apple packaging or a brand new phone you clearly bought something without reading the description.... the battery health was at 98% and I‚Äôve had it for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs been an amazing upgrade!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far it‚Äôs working perfectly- looks great- battery lasts 24 hours (87% Battery Health) - really works well. I‚Äôm glad I bought it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone! Like new, no marks at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The extra storage is amazing! The phone came almost brand new, a big upgrade from my last, even if the battery life is 94% . I was hesitant to buy a phone online let alone at the price, but this was worth it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is great it has great battery life which is a plus good camera picture more. When I got the phone I didn‚Äôt have a case for it for a week and I‚Äôve dropped it many times and it did not scratch or break this phone is a beast buy the way it‚Äôs in an outer box now. Lol I love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase this one because it looks like an iPhone 13 pro but costs less."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came nice and no scratches or nothing everything worked well but it was lagging when I was trying to set it up but I didn't think much of it and continued to use it but I've had it for 3 days now and I'm going to return it because it has been nonstop lagging and glitching, I've restarted it, deleted stuff, reset it, cleared everything and it hasn't done a thing to help, I was listening to music and it was changing the song that was on, I had a friend next to me and had the phone laying down and neither of us was touching it and it was going through apps and I was on Spotify and it went to Instagram and started playing reels, I will be returning this item and I also believe it is hacked so I don't recommend this item to anyone. DO NOT BUY."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first I was skeptical about ordering a phone off of Amazon. But then when the phone came in and I took it out the box, it was gorgeous. It had a few scratches on a camera lenses but he didn‚Äôt stop the camera from working. The battery life is amazing. I literally charge this phone once a day. This is the best phone I ever had."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice iPhone, works good and has a nice amount of battery life. Very impressed, highly recommended. Face ID works very good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came in 2 days earlier that posted. It looks and works like new! Very happy with this phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice phone. I received the original charger as well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve submitted this review already but can‚Äôt find it‚Ä¶ it had a video that clearly showed the screen scratches but that was deleted from my phone after I submitted the review‚Ä¶ not sure what‚Äôs going on. It was not grade A renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I did order the MIDNIGHT GREEN version but was sent the space grey version. Minor detail as my dad doesn‚Äôt care, I just wanted him to have a matching green phone with a green case. Battery is about the same as mine, still is great shape. Was a breeze to setup but, it did have a hell of a time updating. It refused to update via iTunes. I restarted my pc, restarted iPhone, didn‚Äôt help. Updated OTA, almost didn‚Äôt work. Spent 6 or 7 hours downloading the update (McDonald‚Äôs WiFi is slow). Dad is slowly adjusting to an iPhone instead of an android."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It's definitely a change from the iphone 8. I've had it for about a week now and it seems to work really well. Getting used to not having the ""home"" button was easier than I thought. The phone is in great condition with a 94% battery capacity, no scratches, and an included screen protector already on the phone. I'll update if anything changes but it seems like a great buy so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Almost like new and included a few months of AppleCare left. No scratches or any flaws. Battery was at 91% as promised. I feel I really lucked out."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came perfectly but it was NOT fully unlocked which is the whole point in purchasing the phone so this was very unacceptable. Tried to connect to boost mobile carrier and was told still locked to sprint very disappointing when I spent my hard worked money, I did receive full refund but I wanted my item I paid."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I replaced a iPhone 6S with 16BGB with this 11 Pro iPhone. What a step forward. Faster processor, better camera, better display, etc. I'm totally satisfied with this iPhone and would recommend to whomever is looking for a new iPhone to purchase. No scratches or defects with this phone and the charged battery last 2+ days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mine was a ‚ÄúRenewed premium‚Äù The phone came in pristine physical condition: no scratches anywhere. Battery life is great. I would by a renewed premium without hesitation again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did have a minor scratch like half an inch on the screen but that‚Äôs about it. Everything else working fine, battery in perfect conditions, top and back of the phone in mint conditions. Unlocked so it was just inserting my sim card, putting my iCloud account and ready to go. Face ID flawless like a brand new phone, really no complaints, I‚Äôd take that little scratch on the screen for the massive discount I got it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very pleased with the product and customer service"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una belleza, no me hice falsas expectativas porque es muy clara el estatus de renovado, en mi caso recib√≠ la unidad con un peque√±o rasp√≥n casi imperceptible en la pantalla y con 93% de capacidad de bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I ordered this phone here I was worried it would go wrong. But now that I have it in my hands right now I can safely say that it is perfect! Some minor tiny scratches on screen, but barely noticeable. It‚Äôs still perfect nonetheless, it‚Äôs like if I actually bought it from an Apple Store. So I can safely say this was worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had the phone for a few days now, and all seems well. Great camera quality and responsiveness. Product was packaged as described, with the accessories described in the listing, and it arrived early. Cosmetic damage is as described for refurbished phones (very minimal, no noticeable damage when held at arm‚Äôs length.) at this time I am very satisfied with my purchase. However, as I said, I‚Äôve only been using the product for a few days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I do not usually order Apple ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù iPhones. I thought I‚Äôd take a chance & order it & hope it‚Äôs not a piece of scratched up junk.
Much to my surprise, I was amazed how ‚Äúalmost new‚Äù shape it was in! It had no scratches at all anywhere on it! I set it up and it works Great!
The price was perfect!
So, I purchased 2 more, one for my son & daughter!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","2 months in... so far so good. Battery capacity was at 100% when I received it. It came with a protective screen on it. Upon taking it off for a more durable screen protector I noticed there were scratches. HMMM... wasn‚Äôt too happy about that. But I did save $$$ of dollars buying this renewed. I‚Äôll take what I can get. Scratched are completely unnoticeable when protection screen is on. Woohoo!! Camera game has totally upgraded. 4K videos are poppin! I was able to send high quality interview videos and create great group project videos."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like a new phone so far , so good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Description said it worked and looked as new. It arrived with a light and a deep scratch on the screen. Disapointed"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it from WBB . Pristine condition. 100% battery Health. Just a tiny bit scratch on the upper right corner not visible though when the screen is on. Works flawlessly. Getting one and half day battery life with consistent usage. Honestly satisfied specially with this price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love This IPhone! I haven‚Äôt owned an iPhone Max since an iPhone XS Max; and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with it all!
This iPhone 11ProMax might be heavier then the regular iPhone 11 but it has tons of features a regular iPhone 11doesn‚Äôt! It might be a refurb but it has no scratches on it at all! Love the storage of 512gb! It is lightning fast too!
Definitely worth every penny!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i keep my phone well protected with a nice solid case and screen protector. never abuse or over heat it. it is a company phone so it is used just for calls and txt. after 3 month of use the phone is now useless and is sad because i spent so much money on it."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it for my wife and so far so good, it hasn't given her any problem so i haven't had any problem with it.... Its overpriced as all IPhones are ...the face recognition is just as effective as any other in the market. They did do away with the finger print scanner. thats the only draw back"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The Phone Wasn't Supposed To Come On Until Friday...But It Came Today Instead üòÅ The Phone Is Bigger Than I Expected It To Be. The Only Thing I Don't Like Is There's A Scratch On The Screen And Then There's Beat Up Marks Around The Edge Of The Phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the cellphone it self looked pretty good at first with a very few scratches at the corners , it came with a screen protector applied and i didn't want to listen to other reviews who said that there are scratches on the screen but not visible until you remove the screen protector but in the first day a very weird issue was happening in which the screen become unresponsive after the battery drops below 50% , charge it and it becomes good again ,now this issue had me remove the screen protector to see if its causing the issue which reveled the scratches and a pretty ugly scuff , had to return ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it came in reasonably time. I loved the fact that it was unlocked. It was easy to activate it with my number in minutes. I‚Äôm just upset about loosing the finger ID,but what do you expect upgrading from a 6s+ to this now 11 pro max."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy bien lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 11 Pro Max arrived in less than 3 days and it was in perfect condition! I love this phone. It was packaged very well and immaculately clean with no scratched or marks.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just as description, like new. Excellent"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don‚Äôt buy refurbished iPhone people are reporting phone stolen and selling them back"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. I just received the phone today, and I couldn‚Äôt even tell that it was refurbished (even though it is). My package contained the phone itself and what I think is the original charger. Some people complained about receiving cheap chargers with their orders, but that was not the case with my order. It looks brand new and works as it should. The phone was also shipped very quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I am satisfied with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am absolutely in love with my new phone. Have had it for about 3 wks now and my only complaint was not reading the Apple iOS 14 update before..so camera settings changed. I couldn‚Äôt revert. A complete nightmare for 3 days. However, proud of my purchase..worth the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù. Money wel spent. Face recognition works even in the dark lol forgive me I love it! Battery life was 100% healthy and works great. I would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone received in perfect condition. Absolutely no issues with phone or switching SIM cards. My cell carrier is AT&T. Previously had an iPhone 6, so this was a bit of an adjustment getting used to this bigger phone. It‚Äôs quite a bit thicker than my old phone, but not an issue. I can still fit it in my back pocket, lol."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life was at 94% capacity when I got it but considering how good the battery life is ! it was not a problem"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is new!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was pretty good but it came with the screen cracked, so I returned it and I bought it again and now I‚Äôm waiting for it, but if it wasn‚Äôt for that the phone was in pretty good conditions!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i received my device (midnight green 64gb iphone 11 pro max) today and am very pleased with the purchase so far. the phone arrived in flawless condition, no dents, chips, cracks, screen issues, nothing. on top of beautiful physical condition, it has a 99% battery health! it had a screen protector on it right out of the box, i didn‚Äôt have to get my own to put on. i received my package a day early, and overall am very very happy with the purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone 11 max pro did meet my expectations. Item was in a great condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vida √∫til de bateria 98%, est√©ticamente algunas rayas en las barras laterales y en la parte trasera del equipo lo dem√°s en perfectas condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Well recommended. Still a good phone at a good price. Battery always 95% no scratches. Very pleased with purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect condition, very happy that I saved money by buying this refurbished phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything looked and worked flawlessly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Las c√°maras muy claritas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was extremely nervous to order phone from here. I am writing this review to help any ones worries like I had. The refurbished phone I received had a TINY little scratch on top left corner. However the amount of money I saved and stress saved from going into store and purchasing is SO worth it. Highly recommended!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ill start off by saying when this arrived the box was ROUGH, i had no hope anything inside was in any working condition. If you handed me this phone without context I would believe it was brand new from Apple. It is spotless, battery lasts nearly two days without charging for me and my screen times is about 16 hours total. The facial recognition is great, albeit wearing a mask nowadays you will have to use the pin to unlock the screen. This is my first iPhone and I have no complaints."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the features.
Face recognition is the best thing since cane sugar was found. Has good battery life.
Good valve for cost."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great battery life and everything works as expected."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Convinient. Excellent condition. Fast shipping."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone I still actually have it my only gripe is that my speakers are not as loud as they should be for the money I spent but everything else works just fine"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am never buying Amazon renewed ever again. I swear as a someone who refurbishes and repairs phones myself I am appalled at the absolute GARBAGE that passes for quality in this industry. AMAZON should be BETTER than this, to sell something as REFURBISHED that has huge scratches on it like this.

but this is not ""Amazon renewed"" this is sold by a 3rd party seller who likely refurbed the device themselves. If I was refurbishing this and selling it for $1030 I would put a new LCD on there if it has a scratch!!!!!!!! They cost like $200. You will still make mad profit off of whoever you bought it from. You can deduct.

And Amazon if you censor my review I am turning my dissatisfaction to YOU! I WILL call Amazon corporate if this review is censored like some of mine have been in the past for warning customers about problems.

The other problem I had was that I was unable to cancel the order literally 15-20 after making it, and it did not ship for another 24 hours! This is not a ""it already shipped"" problem.

So basically I am $2000 in the hole right now and I am going to order this straight from Apple so I know I get a quality product. So $3500 in the hole until I get refunded for the first which should have been refunded and this one with the huge gauge on the screen.

Absolutely ridiculous. Stop selling things as ""Amazon renewed"" when they're refurbed by a third party."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Item was just as described, perfect!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in a box with charger, mine had a minor scratch on the top corner on the front and battery health is 87%. Had to call the phone company to set it up. Works well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone and set it up and then the keyboard didn‚Äôt work after that. Can I return it and get another one in its place?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works perfect was able to activate it with boost mobile easily. The value for the money is great. And the face recognition works perfect. All around a great phone and came with 94% battery life on its battery. So I‚Äôm happy with this purchase. And I would recommend this company to purchase from. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the phone but all the previous info from the person before wasn't erased."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy such an expensive phone brand new, but took the risk. I usually sign a finance agreement with T-Mobile for a new phone every 2 years but lately they have not had great deals and financing from them is a 3 year agreement. So, I decided to buy the phone renewed. Surprisingly, the phone arrived a couple days sooner than the expected delivery date. It had not scratches on it. I was able to swap my sim and start using it in a matter of seconds."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se actualizo el tel√©fono pensando que de esa forma se solucionaba, socio igual. Se reviso los par√°metros de teclado y sigui√≥ igual. El cristal posterior ten√≠a mancha por debajo del mismo indicando qu√© tal vez se sumergi√≥ el dispositivo. Es una pena, no recomiendo a este vendedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing much just what I stated"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Really good!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like with everything on it , a battery heath is 100% brand new. App moving smooth and camera too. Nothing to dislike."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first, I was quite skeptical because I had seen reviews saying the iPhones were locked or that they were cracked. But NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE!! Truly a professional seller with care and the utmost quality for their customers. It even had a screen protector pre-installed and its such a small thing, but its things like that make this shopping experience even better. I'll definitely go back to get my next iPhone from them in the future!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have owned and used extensively for 2 months and 10 days. Have no issues with any aspects. It did come with a glass screen protector installed properly which was nice. Cord and charger were not apple branded which was unfortunate. I""m sure the cord is inferior, but I have other cords around so its not a problem. No earbuds were included. Would accept the aftermarket auxiliary equipment again to save the money given that the phone seems to be pristine."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo excelente, funciona a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy f√°cil de usar pero muy malos de la bocina del o√≠do"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I purchased phone options were return and refund eligible now they‚Äôve changed it. I wanted to exchange for a phone with a higher battery life (apple recommends new battery at 80% and below) this phone is at 81%. I‚Äôve been emailing seller and they only responded ONCE! Tried to do refund and now I‚Äôm asked to pay shipping. I‚Äôll be contacting Amazon this is false advertisement!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It really really in great condition I thought it was new and it was a mistake but good for me that was not the case it was just a great certified great iPhone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like new. Works like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got my iPhone 11 pro max a few days ago and I'm very happy. My iPhone came perfect, just a couple small marks of use but it looks super new. The battery life is 95% which is amazing. They sent me a device with screen protector!! I totally recomend you guys to buy from this company."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","ESTA MUY CARO PARA LAS CONDICIONES GENERALES DE IPHONE. MUY PELADO EN LOS BORDES."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No regrets"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","In a nutshell, refurbished is a bit of an overstatement. This phone dies pretty quick for it to be the Pro Max as I can‚Äôt make it an entire day without charging at least once by the later afternoon. Nevertheless, get what you pay for when it‚Äôs an used item. Can‚Äôt wait till the next phone release so I can get rid of this."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was skeptical about buying the iPhone 11 Pro Max after reading some of the reviews. But my phone came in perfect condition and there‚Äôs no scratches the only thing that I didn‚Äôt like was that it didn‚Äôt come with the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù apple charger but beside that I haven‚Äôt had any problems with the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone has never gave me problems I‚Äôve owned it for almost a year now. It‚Äôs still brand new. Everything works, I‚Äôm very happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought two phones a gold 11pro max and a silver 11pro max. My only problem is I activated my sliver 11pro max and didn‚Äôt realize the GB is wrong. When I purchased this phone it was suppose to have 256GB however, when you go to the settings it only has 64GB. I am PISSED like I already went through the trouble of activating the phone. Now I have to send it back ASAP because I don‚Äôt have nearly enough storage that‚Äôs the main reason why I made sure it had 256GB at purchase. I will never use them again.
Update: Got in touched with them they said they‚Äôll give me a full refund once I send the phone back. I‚Äôll update again once I do so."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Thank you the phone is very good health battery"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After 3 renewed and refurbished phones I finally got this one and it was just like new!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just got it this morning. Pretty happy so far. Still have a lot to learn about the phone. Many new features like it a lot"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Can't believe how immaculate the condition of this phone is. Not a single visible scratch, bump or imperfection. All components and functions work perfectly. It came with a black generic silicone case and generic charger. Fully unlocked and the best is battery 100% which to me seems they put a new one. 100% would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in perfect condition, a big upgrade from my iPhoneX. The front and back cameras are great with a much wider shot! The weight is around the same as the X despite the bigger size. I am using it with Xfinity Mobile with no issues"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm currently living abroad, but I ordered my phone and had it shipped to my parents. My sister unboxed it for me while we facetimed, and she approved the quality! She said the last owner took great care of it, and now she wants to swap phones!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone I received looks brand new. I'm shocked it's a used device. No issues with carrier or anything I was with sprint they just gave me t-mobile chip now that they are the same company. Got to keep my awesome plan and use the new phone best of both worlds. Thank you so much buySPRY for a great deal and a awesome phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works as expected"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything with the phone is fine, except the price, I thought more accessories were coming with it, but I didn't read the item description, so that was my fault. But the phone work great and my wife is happy with it, so."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular esta en excelentes condiciones, la vida del celular se encuentra en 89%. Est√©ticamente se encuentra muy bien, no he encontrado desperfectos y me ha dejado muy satisfecho. Eso s√≠, tener en cuenta que no llega en caja original ni con accesorios originales, de igual forma, pra mi fue una buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received a new phone with 100% battery capacity and a 1-year warranty by Apple. It works and looks like new, no scratches. It also has an original cord and charger (no earphones and original packaging). I was worrying regarding the purchase but I am happy with it now because I got the iPhone I wanted but 300 dollars cheaper.Great deal!Update: 3 month after the purchase phone works great."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was perfect accept one scratch on the top of the phone that wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the description but everything else was 5 stars"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono tiene grandes se√±as de desgaste en la pantalla, se nota que se ray√≥ una parte en exceso al pasar el dedo, tiene picada la parte superior y raspado uno de los bordes del lente, el vidrio trasero tiene como manchas, realmente no lo recomiendo ya que est√©ticamente est√° como un 6/10 en cuanto a la bater√≠a probablemente en 6 meses toque cambiarla porque ven√≠a con el 83%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had this phone for 6 weeks now and have had no problems. It works and looks great."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything appeared great when I first got this but about a week ago was the first time I ever needed to zoom with my camera and it shakes! Even when I steady it on the table. Pictures come out blurry and everything. I tried to contact the seller but I‚Äôm past my 90 days they said so I‚Äôm out of luck with a very expensive purchase. I wish I knew somewhere I could take it to get it repaired."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","All around great phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it ... good phone arrived with no scratches dents or marks and the charger that came with it is amazing it charges my phone completely in 30 mine very happy with my purchase don‚Äôt be scared order one from them u won‚Äôt be disappointed"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","1) So far everything is working perfectly, not a scratch, 100% battery life, came with a screen protector on.2) 2 months later and I am still glad I bought this phone.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm so glad I decided to do this instead of signing another contract. The phone works great and came in perfect condition. Great price, too. Didn‚Äôt want to go into debt.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","hice una compra del iphone renovado y lo cambie porque tenia 90% de bateria con vida util, y opte por comprar el iphone renovado premium, pensando que tendria mucha mas vida util de bateria y llego con una pila de vida util del 91%, es verdad que en la descripcion dice mas de 90% pero 1% no es nada para la diferencia del monto.en temas de estetica el iphone esta impecable, pero en temas de bateria me esperaba mucho mas, ya que es lo que mas importa en un celular"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought thinking it would be like new as stated and turns out it is a buggy, glitchy nightmare and will not be purchasing refurbished next time."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My battery life is 87%, however the phone was in perfect condition. No scratches, cracks, nothing. I was scared to buy from here because of the reviews but ended up having a good phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone arrived a day earlier and without original cable and accessories buy that what you get when ordering renewed phones, External appearance is pristine and battery health 100%. the phone looks like new. Also I cannot buy AppleCare+ with no apparent reason. Looking into the IMEI everything seems legit and not refurbished or locked phone. Great product and great service from BuySPRY"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers sound like phone has water damage and very distorted. Everything else is ok. When you renew or refurbish a phone make wouldnt you make sure all features are working properly?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","descriptions says it wont show any damage with in an arms length, well that wasnt my case phone was dirty and had about 5 scratches on the screen one is very visible with in a few arms distance how they like to say lol i would buy again specially at the price to receive something like this would be happier if was around the 800 to 900 mark for the 512gb"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So I got this phone everything is great except my screen is Cracked in the middle which led to the corners cracking!!!

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Una decepci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came as requested and no problems whatsoever. I‚Äôve been using it the past few months since I got it and works amazing. No scam. Trustworthy seller. Battery lasts me almost 2 days of usage which I can‚Äôt complain about."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has scratches and battery health is 87% which means it dies FAST. $750 for a phone that‚Äôs not in tip top condition, kinda frustrating and disappointing. I would appreciate if I could have a replacement sent to me because this is now the only phone I have so I couldn‚Äôt just send it back until I get a replacement but disappointed to say the least."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it works perfectly other than me not being able to use the facetime app :-( but I‚Äôm sure it can be fixed some sort of way.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was perfect but it was listed as fully unlocked and it was not which is false advertising. It was policy blocked by consumer cellular. I don't recommend purchasing from this company. It took a whole lot of headache to figure out what company it was locked with and now my daughter has to use this company and not the original company she wanted."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with a cracked screen, sound was muffled with calling and music ect, the camera wasn't cracked but still bad white/circles when I would take a picture with the flash. Battery died way to quick, good picture quality without flash, fast phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","We purchased Iphone 11 from this seller 1.5 years ago and it pretty much started to have problems less than a year later. Now it's stopped working completely. The seller would not provide any type of help or assistance. Basically over one thousand dollars down the drain. Be aware."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs good!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is the fact that I bought it refurbished and the silent button on the side is stuck on the side. I could never get it fixed but can use assistive touch to mute or unmute but for what I paid I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy contenta con el iphone que me llego, parece totalmente nuevo , el estado de la bater√≠a es 100 % , todo a funcionado de maravilla. Me encanto que venia ya con el vidrio templado para proteger la pantalla üëç"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta muy bien funciona al m√°ximo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far phone is been working good üëç"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen condition was WELL BELOW expectations. Think keys in the pocket and no screen shield kind of scratches. The aftermarket screen shield hides some of the damage. This was not at all what I was expecting for the money. I would have just bought new if I had to do it again... no point in trying to save money."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","In great condition, had two small scratches on the touch screen but everything else seems perfect. Battery health at 100% of maximum capacity. Came with a non-apple charging adapter and cable as well as a screen protector pre-installed."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reached out to company and Amazon (since they put their seal of approval on it being refurbished) about the volume on callers end being sketchy at best. Often have to put the phone on speaker bc the caller can‚Äôt hear me when phone is up to my ear. (No I‚Äôm not muting the phone) This is a known iPhone problem. I can only assume it‚Äôs why the phone needed to be refurbished in the first place. Anyway, I asked if a replacement could be sent (less than a month after purchasing phone) and then I send my phone back (or rightfully be charged for replacement). Told no. They said I can buy another one of their phones then send back the broken one. Sure, cause I have an extra $800 laying around to spend on another iPhone to replace the BROKEN one you sent to me?! No I can‚Äôt afford to do that. I am disappointed about getting a still broken ‚Äúrefurbished phone‚Äù. Save yourself the headache and buy a new phone"

Talked to numerous verizon employees who all guaranteed me that it is not compatible with their network. The description specifically says the phone is compatible with verzon. Returning. A very frustrating experience overall."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just got this phone and my Bluetooth doesn‚Äôt work, my calls don‚Äôt go through, my front camera doesn‚Äôt focus it‚Äôs so glitchyyyy"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm In Love With My New Phone This Is One Of The Best Phones I‚Äôve Ever Had Thanks So Much For My Product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone come in excellent conditions, good battery life (96%), without scratches, but don't have original ac charger and cable, but the price is excellent."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone arrived in 24 hours, perfect as new not a single scratch, display protection already on and still in Apple warranty for another 7 months.
Thanks!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent product. Very pleased with the quality of the phone. Will buy from this seller again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal cell phone, the sound is really low and wont turn up"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Even it's a preown iphone 11 pro max, but still in good condition. The only negative thing is too heavy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was near perfect, some imperfections on the screen but it was operational with great battery life."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing wrong with my device so far! I love it!! Came with a screen saver and charger.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had to return the phone due to the feel of a cheap screen replacement, felt like plastic and the touch response was delayed. Terrible phone to say the least. I am reluctant to buy another one. I am sure they are not all like this, but how many would you have to buy and return before you get a good phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Folks please remember that this is being advertised as a ‚ÄúRENEWED UNIT‚Äù. The amount of refurbishment efforts and QA-QC checks that was supposedly performed on the unit was clearly lacking on this one. After paying nearly $950, any buyer would be expecting, at the very least none of these visible imperfections (photos). Instead, I found a healthy amount of scratches around the entire phone perimeter, even in the area of the camera lenses! Now, what does it say about the overall phone condition, especially if you are planning to keep it for at least a year or two?

Not very pleased with this purchase.

BTW - This is my second attempt buying from this vendor. I initially bought a 256GB IPhone 11 Pro Max Gol (Renewed and Fully-Unlocked) from them. I had to return that one too since it won‚Äôt activate or accept a working SIM from T-Mobile. Perhaps, I was just being unlucky as other reviewers posted better results? Oh well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received it in May and so far so great!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I've had the phone for a week couldn't be happier works excellent no issues , thank you !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came in great condition. Battery 99% . I‚Äôm so love in love with this phone . Came a day early .."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen on this phone did not work. When I contacted this seller for support I was informed that I needed to pay and ship this phone back and then they would send me a new one out. I do not trust them to send a new one or one that was not also defective. I have had other sellers send a new item immediately and then I could return the defective device. Very unsatisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone came to me like new not a thing wrong with it just love this phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Been using it all day since it arrived. Love it so far. And it‚Äôs camera is incredible. Fastest phone I‚Äôve owned so far. Definitely worth 5 stars."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono parece como de f√°brica, incluyen garant√≠as y lo entregan con cargador y con vidrio templado, muy recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs just great and like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it! Great condition! Tiny scratch in the screen but nothing major and nothing anywhere else."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got the phone everything appeared fine. Until I decided to make a call. The speaker of the phone DOES NOT WORK. I messaged the seller about this and he was fully aware that the items had not been refurbished properly. He was aware of the problem and suggested I ‚Äúgo get it fixed for 50 bucks‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I bought two iPhones from them and it appears that they have the same issue. You can only hear the person on the other line if they are on speaker or if your earphones are connected. I would not recommend them at all. I asked for a partial refund and he said I was ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and ‚Äúnah he won‚Äôt do that‚Äù‚Ä¶ This has been an incredibly inconvenient and awful purchase. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came quick and in amazing condition. Also came with a glass ant-crack screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very efficient and fast ordering system and reliable delivery backed by Amazon brand, got this order in less than a week and the phone was just as described."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con bordes golpeados, esperaba algo m√°s nuevo"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","don't buy from this seller without purchase of extended warranty"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love this phone so much, battery life is long, and I'm on it 24-7!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is beautiful, as expected. However, it is glitchy, slow, and the facial recognition does not WORK. My only option is to go to the Apple store which is 2 hours away from my home. I'm seriously considering going back to my iphone 7...SO DISAPPOINTING!!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","You‚Äôd think after spending 1079 dollars you‚Äôd think the person would be nice and include all the stuff like original box the headphones but all it came in was a white box and the charger phone seems ok will update after getting it setup but that was a big let down so now I have to find a original box for it"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery Life 63% and the product is different from what was described"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente llego como estaba en la descripci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it and pasted it with a film, thinking how so good it is. It turned out that the surface was spent before I pasted it with a film. If I didn't put it on, I didn't know it. I didn't feel very good until I put it on. How can businesses do business like this?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got this to save myself on some money for a new one. So far, the iPhone came in perfect condition. The battery life is fantastic and no issues. Great purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the iPhone 11 it is easy to use and has great features"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","A few minor surface scratches, but not distracting. Great care in shipping and included all standard accessories. Would buy from seller in the future."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am using the phone to take photos & videos and post them to social media. I like it a lot!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received this phone yesterday it‚Äôs very happy with the way it looked very easy to transfer from my other phone this morning I saw something funny on the TV went to record and it started humming it does the same thing when I go to take a picture I did notify the company but have not heard back yet so it‚Äôs risky business when you buy anything used especially when it comes from across the üåä"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first we were nervous buying a refurbished phone. However we purchased two of them. The phones were easy to swap over. The phones worked and looked like new. I would recommend buying from them."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything is going great with this new phone, works perfectly, and looks brand new, it came in a generic box, with generic charger and cable and no headset, but the phone its immaculate. I'm already using it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","quality is very good overall.
Batter life is not what it should be!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone worked out of the box no issues. Was able to connect to my network no problem. Works great."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Definetly worth the buy had very small smudges on the upper right screen but for the discount get a screenprotecter and you womt notice it best buy on Amazon."

No complaints so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came faster than expected! So far so good...no scratches and the battery life is good and the screen protector was already installed...I am pleased and hopefully all is well later on"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great for the price and the fact that you can‚Äôt find the 11pro Max anywhere."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is very slow I‚Äôm so sorry I purchased this phone from this company.
It‚Äôs been a few months later and I‚Äôm still sorry I purchased this phone from this company ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Initially, the phone (iPhone 11 Pro Max) looked fine when I took it out of the box. The outer stainless steel band did have some minor scuffs, but nothing that bothered me. What was peculiar was that the phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, albeit misaligned. I decided to take it off and put my own. And immediately I could notice so many scratches on the screen. It was horrible and well hidden by the screen protector. More than anything, I just want to give this warning: these ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù/refurbished phones are not at the same standard like the ones at the Apple Store. They will be scuffed up. In addition, the battery health was at 98% capacity. From personal experience with my XS Max, it took an entire year for it to drop to that point from 100%. I can‚Äôt say how all these phones they sell will turn it, since YMMV, but a word of warning"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Value for money
I like it very much because it‚Äôs meet my expectations"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it for my wife as an anniversary gift and she won‚Äôt put it down. Absolutely loves it !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like that the phone came with a screen protector‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs battery life is great (normal)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs aesthetics is great quality and looks new‚Ä¶ but they speaker on the ear didn‚Äôt work from the moment I opened the box‚Ä¶ life struck and I had zero time to return this item but you as a seller must fully do a QC on items that are relatively expensive."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The speaker doesn‚Äôt work, so I can‚Äôt use the iPhone as an telephone, to have a normal phone call I have to use either headphones or the speakerphone. Unfortunately I will have to return the iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came faster than it was supposed to in excellent condition and even had a screen protector."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° tan perfecto! Me encanta todo est√° muy bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone has some type of scratch on it, idk if it‚Äôs from the delivery but it‚Äôs not coming off"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Decided to switch to Apple after my Samsung screen cracked and bit was it a mistake. The refurbished phone was fine. The last time I owned an iPhone was the 3G... and I loved that. But since then there have been little improvements and changes. Compared to Android OS... and value in phone tech for the same price... there is no comparison. I tried hard... but IOS is so limiting, so antiquated, so slow, so many more strokes and presses to do simple tasks that is was painful. I really don't get why Apple fanatics done at least try Android before claiming it is far better like most do. They are ignorant at best."

No external damages or liquid touched the phone.This seller did a poor job refurbishing the phone and won‚Äôt take responsibility beyond 90 days.I checked with Apple and they said it‚Äôs a used phone from 2019 that isn‚Äôt covered by Apple. I feel tricked! And the seller doesn‚Äôt care!Ask yourself, will you pay $700 if you knew the phone would stop working 5 months from now? How would you feel?Buy elsewhere!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Rarely write reviews but in this case a must.Purchased this iPhone 11 for my grandsons birthday May 19th 2021 and it was declared dead this November never to be used again.Granted it was a renewed item but at $850.00 you would think it might last longer then 6 mo.The only upside to this story is due to having insurance on that iPhone he was able to buy, for a small price a brand new iPhone 12üòä I personally will never buy a renewed item again."

Phone kept shutting on and off for days(I contacted this company they wouldn‚Äôt help) so I had to go to a repair shop! Now not long after I‚Äôm having problems stating that there is no sim installed AFTER I went and bought a new SIM card. It has been one thing after the next.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone with the understanding I would be able to get AppleCare but when I try to sign up the apple website says ""We‚Äôre sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced."" After this I was thinking about returning the phone within the 3 month return window. Before doing so I dropped the phone and the back glass cracked. I wrote the seller asking if I could return it (even if for a refund for less/just a partial refund) and they said no. Basically once you buy this phone you are on your own so better hope you get a good one!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works great love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with audio issues: I know when phones are renewed they‚Äôre not the same as new anymore but come on, having to pay $600 for a phone that has audio problems is not worth it.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El telefono llego fisicamente bien, la bateria en 98% pero la 1 estrella es por que me vino con el earspeaker da√±ado, se escucha increiblemente mal, no entiendo como una compa√±ia tan grande como ustedes no se percatan del estado real del dispositivo, yo pague $100 dolares para reritarlo del currier ya que vivo fuera de estados unidos, ahora tengo que pagar otros $100 dolares mas para enviarselos, estoy demasiado decepcionado de ustedes, tremendo dolor de cabeza que me acaban de dar"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone for work purposes, the package does not come in original Apple packaging which was something I did not have a problem with but the first thing I noticed was some scratches on the camera lenses which I was able to ignore until the phone started crashing and lagging after only 1 week of use. I had to take it to a local repair shop and pay $300 to get it fixed which was a real bummer for me. Overall not worth the full price paid (almost $1000)."

If you buy it, make sure to check everything on it. Don‚Äôt simply trust just because it is being purchased at Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would not recommend purchasing a refurbished device from Amazon. Shortly after my 90 day warranty expired my Apple Pay has quit working and is not able to be fixed. Amazon is not able to help me since the warranty has expired. It's not worth saving a couple of dollars ordering it from Amazon, but it from someone that will stand behind device defects longer than 90 days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I don‚Äôt like the fact I bought two of the same items and they had identical scratches on them which were very very visible and deep poor on your side to sell this at such a high price point‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased my iphone 11 pro max in August 2020 and now the front camera isn't working properly. It has 2 horizonal lines and purple tint. I contact the seller and he informed me that I had to contact Apple. I went to the Apple store and was informed that this is an hardware issue and it will cost approximately $400 to repair. I'm very disappointed that I trusted this seller.

Disappointed Customer,

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Best Buy ever I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","it's good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At the beginning when I got the phone, every thing looks new and perfect. I was so excited. But then I started noticing the phone restarts on its own randomly during the day. I may not be doing anything at the moment. But it still restarts on its own. The frequency of restarting began to raise a concern to me. I reached out to the seller Buyspry, they asked me to restore and restart the phone but it did not help. I reached out the apple to find a solution and they said the battery was fine. There were panic logs on my phone as well. Scheduling an appointment with the Geniusbar took forever due to the pandemic. I bought another phone from the same seller but the issue is still the same. The phone also restarted even without me installing anything to it so I returned it. But now I‚Äôm stuck with a phone that restarts all the time and they say they won‚Äôt accept the return anymore. It‚Äôs frustrating. I recommend either try another seller or make sure you get additional insurance."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had an iPhone basically since they have first started making them. I like iPhones.
But the iPhone 11 is the worst phone I have had in the last 15 years. I hate this phone so much. Just get the iPhone 8 if you want a decent iPhone.
I regret that I did not do further research on this piece of junk.
Ever aspect sucks. It has issues pairing with Bluetooth devices. It has issues with syncing to files, connecting to WiFi. The finger print scanner is gone and sometimes the phone will open up quickly and other times it takes 30 seconds just to get the screen to light up, even when poking it with a finger over and over (no case or anything to prevent it from having issues here).
Trust me, I like iPhones. Never had any of these issues before. Save yourself the overpriced amount that this phone is and even more so, save the frustration that comes with it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought the phone from apple, it was more expensive, but it came with warranty. I would recommend to upgrade if you have the money to spare, but if you have the iPhone x or newer is not worth it as you will not feel much difference."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the iPhone came ! It works perfectly fine I was scared to order because of the negative reviews but it came in perfect condition.
Update : couple weeks later it‚Äôs still working perfectly fine"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love every thing about this phone the emojis when you face time to"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Best thing I ever bought."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not worth 1 star. DO NOT ORDER!!!
I reture the phone since June 29. They got the package since july 1 but they dont refund the money back. I calling them everyday nothing updates. Only thing i want is the money back so i can order another phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it. Worth every penny and picture quality is amazing. Thank you."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It arrived in excellent condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen suddenly magnifies to a point you are not able to even turn it off for a reset. The screen freezes and will not allow any movement to clear the screen and return to the usable screen one to open another app. This requires that you try and turn the phone off to hopefully re-set itself but the screen is magnified so large that turn the turn off slide is barely visible by one of it's edges.
FRUSTRATING !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it brand new and the phone died after 4 months (we're talking about a phone thats worth more than a $1,000). Lost all the info and images. Took it to Apple, they ""fixed"" it and returned after several days. The fixed phone lasted only 2 months and started restarting non-stop. Will never buy an Apple product again. Read on the internet, there millions of people complaining about Apple products."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is the best thing ever I need a nother one for free please."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Suck"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worst Amazon Experience till date with a third party seller. BuySRY is the name i think. JUST DON'T BUY THIS. You'll regret it. The item is defective and the seller will promise you resolutions after proof only to deny you everything. Horrible experience and i hope no one has to go through the same thing again. Poor communication by the seller and Amazon reps also led to more hassle. Had to get a resolution from the executive team who were very helpful."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Absolute garbage. These aren‚Äôt renewed, they are just old used phones. Both of my iPhones came with marked/scratches up screens. The bottom of the phones also have a void sticker."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Why the hell would you spend that much!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did not meet my needs"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don't waste your money the phone is a hunck of junk you can't download very easily and no power supply and no manual for phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone arrived without a SIM tray. I cant determine if its locked or unlocked . had some wear and scratch. Will update review ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","you might as well pay for a brand new phone on the apple website. why pay this price for a refurbished discontinued iphone... come on guys"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Scean broken."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","High price and low specs as compared to Huawei P40 pro."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is a USED Phon Not a brand new one!
Be aware people!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It glithes a lot I would not buy it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone!! Make sure you order the upgraded refurbished from Amazon. Do NOT buy from a third party. Both my past two phones were from buyspry and Jem jem. Horrible phones. Visible scratches and degraded batteries. I made certain that this time is was actually refurbished by Amazon and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Absolutely NO scratches. 99 percent battery health. Looks brand new and works brand new as well. I love the larger screen. Perfect for gaming, reading, watching movies etc. The camera is phenomenal! Sound is nice and sharp. Synced up beautifully with my Apple watch, iPods, blink cameras and beats headphones. Will update if anything changes or goes wrong. However, so far, after a week it‚Äôs still performing wonderfully."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all, look at the trade in value at the top of the listing. They currently give UP TO $491 for an 11 Pro Max. That would be for a 512GB in perfect condition. For the 256GB I ordered in ""fair"" condition for $742, they probably gave the previous owner $300-$400. After receiving the phone, they dust out the holes, give you $10 worth of a cheap short charger cable and transformer brick I already have tons of. Then jack up the price $300-400 for 15 minutes of work and $30 in shipping / charger cable.

I paid $742 and $750 for the first and second phones I ordered respectively. The first phone came with a chinese aftermarket screen. Newer iphones can detect when an aftermarket screen is used and AFTER transferring all my data it appeared with the message. About 1 in 10-20 keystrokes would misregister and the key next to it, even sometimes across the keyboard it would hit backspace. The 3D touch would not work properly either and the color shade was off from a genuine screen. Another issue when replacing screen is the waterproof seal is broken. While this is replaceable when replacing the screen, who knows if it was done at all, much less properly. This phone arrived totally dead, which is TERRIBLE for lithium batteries. The battery was at 90% of new capacity, which is the bare minimum for what I would consider acceptable on a $750 phone.

With that POS on the way back to the seller, I decided to take a chance on a second one, this time for a few more dollars. It arrived about 50% charged, which is best for long term lithium battery storage. However, the battery was already down to 84% of new capacity. With 6 months of use it would likely be down another 5-10% capacity. At 75-80% the phone actually slows down to reduce power consumption. I don't consider this to be acceptable for how much they want for these used phones. I purchased this hoping to get 2-3 years of use from it, but the factory battery will be absolutely pathetic if used for that time already starting from 84%.
I have swapped many iphone screens and batteries, each generation Apple makes it more challenging. This phone would be my most difficult yet. Also the chinese batteries sold on this site are always sketchy and iffy on quality vs a new genuine one that you can't purchase from apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got the iPhone 11 Pro Max with ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù. Phone is perfect cosmetically. Worked out of the box and activated seamlessly. Recommend this seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is the second iphone I buy refurbished from Amazon (1st time from this seller). Everything works great on this phone! I tested face recognition, touch screen, phone calls and camera. Functions as intended. Battery percentage is good at 87% (same as my last phone) and it came in completely unlocked and ready to go. No visible scratches on screen, back glass or frame, I‚Äôd rate this products appearance a 9.5/10 looks almost brand new. This specific one is the rose gold with 256gb storage. The packaging was a little lacking in interior padding but the phone arrived undamaged. Also came with an original charger and cable which is a plus!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this to replace my iphone 8 plus. Apple and my cel carrier had the 12 and 13 on back order but I dont need the latest model. I got the 11 refurbished and unlocked and saved hundreds of dollars but got a much better phone with waaaay more storage. So now I can download all the apps without worrying about my phone not having storage. It was pretty easy to transfer all my contacts etc to the new phone too. I am thrilled with this purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First, I think I should mention that there‚Äôs no damage to the screen but there‚Äôs a considerable amount of scratches to the body. There‚Äôs no earbuds in the box and you receive cheap 3rd party accessories. Since this is a renewed product, I would be okay with this. However, I‚Äôve come to discover that I received a 256 GB instead of the 512 GB option I ordered. This is either a mistake from the seller or an outright scam and misinformation on the listing. PLEASE check your device‚Äôs about section to check the storage capacity. I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôll never buy Amazon renewed products again and will buy from my carrier or from Apple themselves. I encourage you to do the same."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all this Seller on Amazon is great to work with ! I was having an issue with the phone that I couldn‚Äôt figure out and this seller went out of their way to help. I didn‚Äôt want to return the phone as it is great. So you can buy with confidence from them. I was also worried about ordering a refurb phone from some of the experiences of others But all has been just fine here. The phone is pristine condition and seems to be working great ! I guess time will tell but right now I am happy and I would definitely buy from this company again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","$570 por esto!, estoy realmente sorprendido, es un buen tel√©fono y me parece su punto m√°s fuerte el 94% de vida √∫til de la bater√≠a, llego el mismo d√≠a que lo ped√≠ gracias a Prime, su caja tra√≠a un cargador gen√©rico y un protector de pantalla de vidrio, algo normal en los tel√©fonos de segunda mano es los rayones, este ven√≠a con dos rayones bastante grandes en la pantalla, (No interfieren con la visi√≥n de la pantalla y no se perciben a una distancia considerable), cuando puse el protector de pantalla desaparecieron por completo as√≠ que es un buen punto, un case y todo esta perfecto, espero siga as√≠ estos meses, todo parece bien, la tarjeta sim la tomo sin problemas y tomo solo unos minutos en llevar la informaci√≥n de mi viejo Iphone a este.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just couldn‚Äôt get my self to pay what AT&T wanted so I started looking around for alternatives. Found this phone on Amazon and ordered it based on their return policies if not satisfied.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","For a refurbished phone, this device is in excellent condition. It‚Äôs super clean, not a single scratch or dent. It‚Äôs really immaculate and I‚Äôm super happy to purchase from Buyspry. Battery life was 88% really low but it could pass.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice device!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good deal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone is not in the iPhone original box and the adapter the charger is not Apple brand"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone quality was perfect, seemed brand new. No scratches or nicks"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have to start this review off by saying there is absolutely no reason why you should be buying a brand new iPhone if the renewed version is available for hundreds of dollars less. The phone I received had one VERY minor imperfection, but it was something that was easily hidden by a case. In my experience, very few used phones come with zero scratches, so you have consider the ones with an imperfection on the side or on the back as a perfect used phone. Remember that it isn't new, but you can make it look new by putting it in a case. That's what I did and none can tell. Buy renewed from Amazon!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn‚Äôt even last a week. The screen came off within the same week I received the phone & I had a screen protector and a hard back case & never even dropped it . Now I‚Äôm back using my old phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i like the camera...how fast it is when I look thru my apps..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buena calidad del empaque, producto en excelentes condiciones y funciona a la perfeccion"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looked great and worked great, but the parts they Renewed in the phone made it not able to connect to a network. It had two sims that wouldn't work. And one of them was a internal sim which the 11s don't have. So they put a part for say a 12 or 13 into the 11 making it not usable as a cellular device. Glad I can return to get my money back but wish I could trust amazon to have a device I could use."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worth it all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is renewed but when it arrived it looked almost brand new! I almost couldn‚Äôt tell it wasn‚Äôt brand new, wonderful job!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is in good condition just cameras on back are scratched."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought refurbished from Amazon, had reservations but all is working. Read MANY reviews and came to conclusion that this was the best choice for me. Many reviews said that buying up to the 12 or 13 model was overspending and not gaining much.This phone works great, enjoy the speed and all the other features not on previous phone.
I did buy the extra 1 year guaranteed, I think is was an extra $60. but made me much more comfortable."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Item came as described. Gently used and no obvious defects other than a few slight scratches on screen. Phone came with a screen protector already installed.

Pictures of dog have blazing yellow I with no easy way to prevent it. They want want me to edit it after the fact.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono tard√≥ una semana en llegar, un d√≠a antes del previsto, la verdad lleg√≥ de muy muy buena calidad, hasta ahorita que llevo 2 horas us√°ndolo funciona perfectamente, lo uso con red Telcel y agarr√≥ perfectamente la se√±al, de igual manera est√©ticamente se ve casi en perfecto estado, solo un peque√±o golpe en una esquina pero lo √∫nico, en la pantalla todo perfecto, sin ning√∫n detalle y era mi mayor miedo porque vi muchos comentarios donde estaba rayada y este lleg√≥ todo perfecto, bocinas, Face ID, llamadas, c√°maras, todo en perfecto estado, como si fuera todo nuevo. El √∫nico detalle es que lleg√≥ con 84% de bater√≠a, yo creo que un poco m√°s y ya todo hubiese sido perfecto para mi, lleg√≥ en una carga custom y el cargador y el cable no son originales, para que tengan en cuenta eso. Por el precio me parece una compra excelente y yo si recomiendo ampliamente comprarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buen Producto, me llego en buenas condiciones y llevo un mes y no me a causado fallas!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me parece una excelente compra por el costo y el modelo del telefono, aun cuando ya tiene sus a√±itos funciona muy bien y aun le quedan otros a√±os de actualizaci√≥n.El unico detalle que yo le encontr√©, es que le cambiaron la pantalla, no es la original de Apple, aun as√≠ es una buena pantalla, tambi√©n es oled, pero si la comparas con otro iphone con pantalla original si se ve la diferencia, pero es algo que realmente en el dia dia ni se nota, funciona muy bien.Est√©ticamente lleg√≥ bien sin detalles y con pila al 89%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Parese nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","compre este articulo hace ya a√±o y medio masomenos sigue en buen estado, excelente la camara, lo unico que he tenido problemas es que no se escucha cuando me llaman y tampoco vibra cuando me llaman pero todo lo dem√°s todo esta excelente.cuando me llego venia con dos marcas de chupones al frente dando a entender que ya lo hab√≠an abierto, as√≠ que nuevo nuevo pues no es.lo revise y si dec√≠a que ya hab√≠a sido abierto.pero bueno de todo lo dem√°s estoy muy contenta con el telefono."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","He aprendido a no dudar de la calidad de los productos reacondicionados. No me ha fallado para nada este celular y lleg√≥ con buen porcentaje de bater√≠a. Cuando puedas, aprovecha."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en buenas condiciones la bater√≠a no llego perfecta, el aspecto es bueno, √∫nicamente el sonido para las bocinas si est√° da√±ado, pero todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego bien empaquetado con un cargador gen√©rico y el celular, es lo √∫nico, de primera vista solo ten√≠a un rayadura en la pantalla pero con una mica de cristal se arreglo, no se ve nada, de bater√≠a llego al 87%, lo uso casi todo el d√≠a y al final de mi d√≠a laboral con un uso cotidiano; llego con el 50-40% de bater√≠aTengo el de 512 GB, a lo mejor tuve suerte pero fue una buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Trae todo sus accesorios, exelente condicion,muy bien empacado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La mejor compra que he hecho en Amazon, el equipo pasa perfectamente por uno nuevo, est√° en excelentes condiciones est√©ticas, vida de bater√≠a al 91% y lleg√≥ antes de lo esperado. Sin duda volver√≠a a comprar, estoy muy satisfecho"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, est√©tica de 9.5/10, le doy esta calificaci√≥n por el echo de que yo esperaba mejor volumen en el altavoz, tambi√©n yo esperaba mejor condici√≥n en la bater√≠a, me llego con un 84% que no est√° tan mal pero si muy pronto tendr√© que cambiarle la bater√≠a al dispositivo, que ah√≠ si ya le sumar√≠a otro gasto, fuera de eso todo sali√≥ bien, me agrado que llegara pronto hasta antes de lo esperado, que llegara con garant√≠a tambi√©n y todo bien empacado, solo por el detalle de la bater√≠a y del altavoz le doy 4 estrellas, le dar√≠a 4.5 pero Amazon no me permite poner .5, tambi√©n esperaba un cable original pero el gen√©rico est√° bien y tambi√©n esperaba que llegara con un cubo de 20w pero llego con un cubo bueno y me agrado la compra, recomiendo al vendedor al 100"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","me lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones y si es original"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba en excelente condici√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En est√©tica parece nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n ray√≥n ni golpe ni nada, la pantalla trae una mica protectora que no le quise retirar. Funcionalidad al 100 sin ning√∫n detalle. Es que pr√°cticamente parece nuevo en verdad, el √∫nico detalle que podr√≠a tener es que la pila tiene una condici√≥n del 85% pero hasta ahora no me ha resultado en un problema, ha aguantado perfectamente todo el d√≠a. Excelente compra hasta ahora."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funcionalmente bien, aunque encontr√© detalles en las condiciones f√≠sicas del iphone como unos rayoncitos alrededor de las c√°maras, y en los botones. A primera vista s√≠ se nota que tuvo un buen tiempo de uso, pero no hay una falla o golpe mayor que sean muy notables"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Como nuevo. Todo fant√°stico."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusta √©l tama√±o, y sobre todo siempre he usado Apple, a√∫n no lo estren√≥‚Ä¶estoy segura que me dar√° excelente servicio!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo pr√°cticamente nuevo, con 100 % de est√©tica, bater√≠a al 90%, hasta ahora funcionando a la perfecci√≥n, llevo 3 semanas con el ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Casi un a√±o con el y mi compa√±ero de viaje no me ha dejado tirado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo con mi celular 6 meses, la pila muy bien, no tengo que cargarlo a cada rato, excelente calidad, pantalla intacta, si recomiendo mucho si deseas comprar algo a un buen costo, volver√© a comprar pronto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","el dispositivo esta en perfectas condiciones, veo que trae soporte t√©cnico applecare si es valida esta garantia ?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a. La verdad us√°ndolo bien bien te dura la bater√≠a un d√≠a.En cuanto a estado del equipo, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ sin un solo ray√≥n, ni parece usado, la condici√≥n es excelente.Obvio, llega en una caja diferente a la original, bien sellada eso si, tambi√©n trae un cargador y cable s√∫per gen√©ricos, pero funcionan.Por el precio, est√° bien. Es un excelente producto, muy recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encanto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despues de 2 meses de uso no me ha dado ningun problema, me llego con 100% de bateria"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo ya con el 1 mes y todo Perfecto llego con el 90 de bater√≠a y sin ning√∫n golpe anteriormente hab√≠a comprado otro iPhone pero con distribuidor de Amazon y lo tuve que regresar al mes por que se calentaba y se perd√≠a la se√±al con este hasta ahora todo bien!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, lo recomiendo pero mucho ojo con la condicion de la bateria"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great condition, battery life is phenomenal, priced less than purchase of a new one, so saving money is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","bueno en relaci√≥n calidad/precio, si lo volver√≠a a comprar.El unico detalle es la bater√≠a no esta al 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy impresionado con la est√©tica del equipo celular, sin ning√∫n ray√≥n, el equipo es totalmente nuevoVolver√≠a a comprar otro celular sin problema, 100% recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","pues esta apenas todo va bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si venia muy maltratado m√°s de los dem√°s que he comprado como reacondicionado pero su funcionamiento es bueno pero no se siente como otros enviados directo de Amazon. Desde el embalaje y caja en una caja sencilla que hasta da miedo pensar que lo enviaron en paqueter√≠a y fue por ah√≠ brincando.Y este toc√≥ que estuviera como manchado de la pantalla pero s√≥lo del cristal y solo se ve si lo ves a contraluz y un poco rayado del cromado del arco pero con el case ya no se ve."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","LLEG√ì CON EL 100% DE BATER√çA, HA FUNCIONADO MUY BIEN, SIN PROBLEMAS, Y F√çSICAMENTE PERFECTO."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a, tiene un peque√±o ray√≥n perceptible en la parte de las bocinas inferiores. Salvo por eso la est√©tica es casi perfecta, estoy contento con mi compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de casi un a√±o de uso, el iPhone funciona perfectamente bien. La verdad ten√≠a el pendiente de comprar un celular reacondicionado pero hasta ahora absolutamente todo sirve EXCEPTO por las bocinas; no est√°n reventadas pero tampoco est√°n funcionando al 100% (si utilizo el altavoz en una llamada a veces puede ser dif√≠cil de escuchar). De cualquier forma como utilizo aud√≠fonos y la bocina superior para llamadas no me representa ning√∫n problema. Cuando me lleg√≥, me lleg√≥ en caja gen√©rica y sin cargador. NO me lleg√≥ con abolladuras o pantalla rayada o cualquier detalle visible. Se ve√≠a pr√°cticamente nuevo. La verdad si lo recomiendo porque los precios del Iphone Pro Max en M√©xico en esas fechas estaban por 20-30 mil pesos en diferentes tiendas y me ahorre un mont√≥n de pejedolares."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hice mis compras con diferentes vendedores pero el mismo producto Amazon me lo marca en el mismo lugar.En la primera compra el celular ven√≠a perfecto, bater√≠a al 100% sin ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, original y pr√°cticamente nuevo, lo √∫nico fue que no ven√≠a liberado, no me pudieron ayudar y tuve que devolverlo, ese vendedor ya no ten√≠a m√°s dispositivos, tuve que buscar otro.La segunda compra, el celular funcionaba ""bien"", me lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a y muy manchado del cristal de la parte trasera, as√≠ que eso no me agrad√≥ y decid√≠ darle la oportunidad unos d√≠as, pero revisando con otros iphone de conocidos,!la c√°mara ven√≠a de muy mala calidad!, se ve√≠a muy borrosa a comparaci√≥n de los otros celulares, eso fue lo que me hizo decidir regresarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto me llego con un d√≠a de retraso, llego en una caja gen√©rica. El cargador tambi√©n gen√©rico.La est√©tica le pongo un 10, la pantalla vino con mica de cristal templado.No le he notado ning√∫n ray√≥n en la pantalla ni nada. Llevo poco mas de una semana con el, y hasta ahora funciona bien. En cuanto a la degradaci√≥n de la bater√≠a llego con el 93%.El producto lo compre en $11,999 a 1 a√±o, a meses sin intereses.Lo negativo:Al momento de actualizar a IOS15.5 la bater√≠a se degrado al 88% (ver imagen) pregunto:Esto es normal?Ya me comunique con BuySPRY y me respondieron, les mande la captura de pantalla de la salud de la bater√≠a, as√≠ como el IMEIConclusi√≥n: En general estoy contento con la compra, el √∫nico defecto, es que la salud de la bater√≠a se deterioro, al actualizar el sistema operativo. por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ con el 85% de la bater√≠a y las bocinas no se escuchan bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El proceso de adquirir mi dispositivo fue muy particular ya que encontre la publicaci√≥n y 20 minutos despues decidi comprarlo, obviamente por ser una compra por internet de un celular ‚Äúcaro‚Äù, ‚Äúdiscontinuado‚Äù y re acondicionado no me sentia del todo seguro, ya que pense que iba a ser un tipo de estafa o no iba a llegar en las condiciones que yo esperaba, afortunadamente todo lo que pensaba termino siendo falso ya que llevo aproximadamente 2 semanas usandolo dia y noche y no me ha presentado falla alguna hasta el momento, cabe destacar que lo recibi sin da√±o alguno y con la condicion de mi bateria al 94%, me apoye mucho de los comentarios de la publicaci√≥n y estuve consciente de que era confiar y tener un poco de suerte en que no llegara da√±ado, repito, hasta ahorita todo ha ido bien y lo seguire usando dia noche, afortunadamente igual el celular cuenta con garantia con amazon y es original, igual desconfie un poco por el precio ya que en otros lugares val√≠a m√°s y por menos capacidad en la memoria, pero un consejo que les puedo dar es que lo intenten, comprenlo, pruebenlo, chequen como aplica la garantia y en caso de que les falle lo devuelven sin ningun tipo de problema."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es reconstruido como dicen, lo malo es que no utilizan partes originales por lo tanto el tel√©fono tiene la caracter√≠stica de detectar el componente que no es original. A pesar de todo esto el tel√©fono funciona correctamente, hasta el momento no he encontrado ning√∫n problema para su correcto funcionamiento. en cuanto a la est√©tica es pr√°cticamente nuevo no cuenta con ninguna ray√≥n. Porcentaje de la bater√≠a es del 100%."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought a beautiful iPhone 11 Pro Max for $575. Phone is in about excellent 9.5/10 physical condition. Came with a aftermarket charger and cable. 86% battery capacity. Took about 1 week to come from Kansas to Ontario. Factory reset and unlocked.The only thing is‚Ä¶ the ear speaker was very crackly and distorted at any volume. It sounded like a blown speaker and made it quite hard to understand people when using the phone as a‚Ä¶ phone or watching videos.Seller offered a full refund and sent a shipping label. It turns out (after talking to a phone repair company) the speaker mesh was caked in fine dirt and grime, duct tape pulled the dirt from the ear piece. Works like new now but I guess it wasn‚Äôt fully ‚Äúclean‚Äù as advertised."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno dispositivo si lo encuentras en oferta aprovecha lleg√≥ con 94% de bateria funciona con Telcel en M√©xico y con Redi Coppel sin problemas con Altan redes"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio tenia dudas por algunos comentarios negativos que llegue a encontrar, decid√≠ arriesgarme y realic√© la compra. El paquete lleg√≥ 2 d√≠as antes de lo estimado por lo cual fue bastante r√°pido. En cuanto a la est√©tica es bastante buena, ligeros rayones en los cromos laterales y un peque√±o ray√≥n en pantalla, que se disimula bastante bien con un protector de pantalla, en cuanto a la parte trasera, la est√©tica es impecable, en cuanto a bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 86%.Llevo poco tiempo us√°ndolo y hasta el momento no ha presentado ning√∫n problema. El √∫nico detalle negativo que encontr√©, fue el cargador y cable que traen, se sienten de muy poca calidad y la carga es bastante lenta. Recomiendo comprar uno original para evitar problemas posteriores con la carga o bater√≠a del equipo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was a great purchase, my old phone broke and needed a new one ASAP without wanting to spend too much. Shipping was fast and when I got the phone in hand I couldn't even tell it was used. Literally no scratches, scuffs, marks, dents, dirt or anything along the lines, the phone looked perfect. When I turned it on to use, setup was easy and without any problems even though I am in Canada and the phone is from the US. The battery is at 100% capacity and lasts me the whole day + some without charging. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and it has been great.There was only one problem I ran into which was my connection dropping frequently but after taking out my sim card and cleaning it and putting it back in the problem seemed to have went away, so I will update if this problem comes back, but so far it's good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 10 d√≠as con el tel√©fono, lleg√≥ en muy buenas condiciones, en una caja gen√©rica con cargador y cable gen√©rico como lo menciona en la descripci√≥n, no tra√≠a ning√∫n ray√≥n en los bordes o en la parte de atr√°s, le quit√© la mica protectora de la pantalla y solo trae dos peque√±as rayitas como si lo hubiesen metido a la bolsa y se hubiese rayado con monedas o llaves, pero no afecta el funcionamiento, le volv√≠ a colocar la mica y todo parece nuevo, ya no ten√≠a garant√≠a apple care, trae una condici√≥n de vida del 91% y me indica que sigue calibrando la bater√≠a, al t√©rmino de la calibraci√≥n baj√≥ a 89%, me hubiese gustado que viniera con m√°s condici√≥n de vida como le√≠ en la mayor√≠a de comentarios que tra√≠an arriba del 95%, pero bueno, el face id funciona muy bien, el volumen, micr√≥fono y bocina funcionan muy bien, la c√°mara es una belleza, y creo que fue una buena compra, es recomendable comprar el cable y cargador original para mantener la bater√≠a en buenas condiciones, seg√∫n Apple tener hasta un 80% de bater√≠a es √≥ptimo, aunque repito, me hubiese gustado que trajera mejor condici√≥n que 89%‚Ä¶aun as√≠ es una buena compra. Espero siga funcionando de manera adecuada."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el tel√©fono llego impecable con un 92% de bater√≠a, con el color que ped√≠ incluso ya ven√≠a con un cristal de protecci√≥n.Lo que no me gusto es que viene con un cargador gen√©rico que no es el original y se calienta mucho cuando lo pongo a cargar y en solo 2 d√≠as bajo de 92% al 90% la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a. Considero que por el precio de $15,500 pesos debi√≥ incluir un cargador original para que esta parte no se afecte ya que al ser un producto re acondicionado esto si le afecta al tel√©fono y es costo cambiar una bater√≠a nueva. (PD m√°ndenme un cargador original üôèüèº)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de 3 meses de uso, el celular funciona sin problemas. Vale la pena adquirir estos productos. Me llego con 86% de bater√≠a y algunos rayones en la pantalla. Con el protector de pantalla no se nota ning√∫n ray√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","LO COMPRE POR QUE ME ABURRI DE LIDIAR CON EL ALMACENAMIENTO CON OTROS IPHONES, ME DEDICO A LA CREACION DE CONTENIDO ASI QUE EL ALMACENAMIENTO ME ES INDISPENSABLE, PARA MI FUE UNA INVERSION MAS QUE UN LUJO. Y ESTOY SATISFECHO, SIN EMBARGO HAY QUE SUPER CUIDARLO POR QUE ES ALGO PESADO Y UNA CAIDA DUELE."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de una p√©sima experiencia con achemex con una primera compra donde me llego una pila en vez del iphone, escog√≠ a buyspry por sus buenos comentarios, me llego un equipo con bater√≠a al 83%, todo original excepto el display, la aplicaci√≥n 3utool me indico que fue cambiado y si se nota porque tiene algo de pegamento a los costados, el display esta un tanto rayado por el uso y todo lo dem√°s esta impecable, debido a la urgencia que tengo decid√≠ qued√°rmelo, pero estar√° al pendiente del funcionamiento,"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vamos, el tel√©fono en s√≠ es de muy buena calidad y por el precio, vale la pena comprarlo.Apenas lo recib√≠ hace unos d√≠as y estoy probando su funcionamiento, rendimiento y funciones para decidir si es un equipo que vale la pena quedarme o hacer efectiva la garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as que se ofrece al adquirirlo.Hasta el momento los detalles que he encontrado, a pesar de saber que es un equipo usado, tiene bastantes rayones en la pantalla frontal que no afectan el funcionamiento y suelen pasar desapercibidos con una mica protectora, algunos detalles en los biseles de las c√°maras y dos o tres golpes y raspaduras en los bordes del tel√©fono, no parece nada grave pero la est√©tica deja que desear y ""se nota"" que es un equipo usado.Otro detalle, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 87%, comprensible al ser usado, pero ser√≠a un plus que tuviera por lo menos un 90%.En general con la compra, bien, nada extraordinario pero con miras a hacer uso de la garant√≠a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ en condiciones perfectas, pr√°cticamente nuevo. Recomiendo comprar"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente, en primer lugar el dispositivo venia sin ningun da√±o fisico, lo revis√© a detalle y no encontr√© ni un solo ray√≥n, vino sin problemas de software y la condici√≥n me llego en un 85%, pens√© que ser√≠a un problema eso de la bater√≠a pero la pila me dura todo el d√≠a, llevo usandolo dos meses y no he tenido ning√∫n tipo de problema, las rese√±as que le√≠a antes de animarme a comprar el iphone me desanimaban un poco, pero decid√≠ arriesgarme y estoy muy contento y satisfecho con la compra, 100% recomendado!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo, al principio dude mucho en comprar usado ya que he le√≠do algunas rese√±as malas y otras buenas, en mi caso el equipo que me lleg√≥ no ha presentado problemas (3 meses de uso).Llego bastante bien empacando, sin rayaduras, sin golpes, el tel√©fono estaba bastante bueno.Claro que se paga un poco m√°s por Amazon pero est√°s pagando SEGURIDAD y CALIDAD, cada tel√©fono viene con una tarjeta de inspecci√≥n llenada a mano sobre alguien que inspeccion√≥ y limpio el tel√©fono.Llego con el 90% de la capacidad de bater√≠a que promete la publicaci√≥n y no he tenido temas que laPila no dure o que se caliente el tel√©fono.Si est√°s dudando en si confiar o no en Amazon Renewed usa esta rese√±a como una evidencia que cumple con lo que promete y tienes la ventaja de regresarlo si no cumple con tus expectativas o con la descripci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in pretty much 2 days! seller shipped the phone immediately and it got to me with no issues. Phone was wrapped very well inside the box.So far everything in the phone works perfectly fine.I'm slightly disappointed in the battery health, was anticipating a minimum of 85% but this one was 84%. My other iphone 11 I've had for over a year (I bought renewed as well), is currently at 86%. But that's my only let down. I belive the listing says between 80-100..I can't remember.I'll update if the phone gives issues, but so far everything works perfectly fine. And for the price I paid, I thought it was way to good to be true. As of 2022, I paid 750 (no tax either) for a 256gb iphone 11 PRO MAX! If you're unsure about buying with this seller, I say you take a chance! I'm satisfied with my purchase (so far)Thank you!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en perfecto estado de todo en excepci√≥n de que la bocina de el audio donde contestas las llamadas estaba un poco sucia pero la lleve a que le hicieran limpieza general a todo el dispositivo y quedo en perfecto estado, me llego con un 94% de bater√≠a es el 3 aparato que compro renovado y no he tenido problema alguno con ninguno de ellos"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno pues el producto me llego en buenas condiciones pero en la parte dela bocina , se ve un poco rallado pero con una funda no se nota , del prosesador esta muy bien me llego con el 87% de pila y llevo ya 3 dias usandolo y esta bien. lo bueno que se tiene 90 dias de garantia"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El costo- beneficio del producto es bueno siempre y cuando funcione"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Sabemos que un tel√©fono reacondicionado puede traer algunos detalles, pero igual esperamos que sean menores y que valga la pena lo que estamos pagando. No se si en las fotos se alcanzar√° a apreciar pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con un golpe importante en una esquina y varios rallones profundos en la pantalla, por lo que decid√≠ que lo voy a regresar."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono es bueno cumple con todas las funciones y la bater√≠a al 90% como lo menciona en la descripci√≥n solo que Tengo dos meses con el y el cargador ya no funciona ninguno de los doscable ni el cuadrito de la corriente, en el producto si especifica que el producto como es refurbished no contiene accesorios originales pero que Amazon revisa que los accesorios Sean de calidad, lamentablemente el cargador del tel√©fono que compr√© no funcion√≥ y lo peor es que la compra no me da opci√≥n de reportarlo. Siento que para este tipo de productos Amazon deber√≠a de verificar mejor la calidad de los accesorios que mandan"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente equip√≥, el √∫nico pero es la vida de la Bater√≠a, lleg√≥ en un 84% de ah√≠ ning√∫n detalle."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular excelente en mi caso la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 100%, muy peque√±os detalles en la parte superior pero casi imperceptible lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ten√≠a mis dudas al momento de comprarlo el equipo est√° en un 99 de est√©tica lo √∫nico malo fue que la bater√≠a llego al 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto lleg√≥ sin problema alguno. Al abrirlo me di cuenta que est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo. El cargador no es original (que te lo avisan desde la compra) pero el problema es que no es compatible el voltaje y no logra cargarlo de forma correcta, incluso podr√≠a da√±arlo ya que se calent√≥.Si tienes un cargador nuevo de alg√∫n iPhone anterior es mejor que lo uses.Fuera de eso, es una gran compra y me quedo satisfecho."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cable cargador no funciona"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Happy with it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! Gave it thought for a couple months was a toss-up between Walmart Amazon and Best-Buy. Best-Buy apparently is a rip off and Walmart warranty wasn't as good! Bought and as stated was like new battery life is at 90% no scratches or dents and came with a new screen protector. Thought i would wait a couple months before posting a review and i,m impressed! Sure a lot cheaper at 949.00 than having bought it new a year ago! Well worth the purchase and would recommend to a friend!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al inicio estaba algo cr√©dulo, muchos otros usuarios comentan el que les han llegado equipos con el 90% al 99% de bater√≠a en mi caso no fue as√≠, si no que ah llegado con un 100% pero, toda la pantalla esta con micro rayas, al igual que los lentes de la c√°mara, es decir de lejos si se logra apreciar que esta muy rayad mas cuando la luz le da directamente, espero poder solucionar lo aplicando una mica, pero de lo dem√°s me estoy muy conforme hasta ahora las fotograf√≠as no eh tenido problema pensando que tambi√©n los lentes est√°n demasiado rayados, no culpo a su anterior due√±o el hecho de no ponerle alg√∫n protector al final es el gusto de cada persona y por eso baja el precio del equipo.Al final de todo, esto es como una ruleta que la suerte nos tocara un buen equipo como uno malo.Si tienen la oportunidad c√≥mprenlo la garant√≠a de Amazon responde muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes de la fecha estimada. Fue una sorpresa completamente. No pod√≠a con las ansias. Lleg√≥ con 90% de capacidad, algo menor de lo que hab√≠a esperado. Trae incluido un cargador gen√©rico, pero que funciona bien y un pincito para sacar el chip, nada m√°s. Mica incluida, pero que tiene dos marcas circulares que no tengo idea de d√≥nde salieron, aunque s√≥lo se ven a contra luz.El equipo funciona bien, una funda es extremadamente necesaria porque es muy resbaloso sin una, a veces como que se tarda en agarrar la conexi√≥n celular, pero s√≥lo es cuesti√≥n de esperar. Lentes en buenas condiciones, c√°mara funcional, flash funciona bien, bocinas funcionan bien, botones funcionan bien. Ya lo dem√°s son quejas que tengo del sistema y del tama√±o de pantalla, pero nada que ver con el servicio de amazon. En resumen, lo compr√© porque hab√≠a una promoci√≥n bancaria, y estuve busc√°ndolo varios d√≠as porque a veces costaba casi 1000 pesos menos, no s√© qu√© factores hay para que ocurran estos cambios de precio, lo √∫nico que s√© es que 18K es demasiado. La bater√≠a s√≠ le dura, aunque no es extraordinaria, no esperar√≠a menos del ‚ÄúiPhone con mejor bater√≠a‚Äù, c√°mara muy buena y la experiencia Apple en todo su esplendor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones, hay un inconveniente tengo inconsistencias en la red y desafortunadamente es solo compatible con la red de AT&T si fuera compatible con todas las compa√±√≠as en M√©xico estar√≠a perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","llego muy rapido el equipo estaba impecable solo el auricular o bocina se escuchaba muy mal tuve que regresarlo, al igual llegando mi devolucion lo volvere a pedir espero que ahora si venga todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Charger is not an authentic Apple version.Was not in the original Apple box."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le doy 4 estrellas por que la pantalla vino muy muy rayada, solo de d√≠a de vez en cuando interfiere la visibilidad, de resto el celular funciona muy bien y cumple, por necesidad no lo regrese, pero si puedes no aceptes uno con rayaduras, es mejor cambiarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llego bien, la pantalla un poco rallada la verdad es que no est√° mal a√∫n que si esperaba un tel√©fono con una condici√≥n de bater√≠a mayor ya que el precio de 12 mil pues si es algo elevado, me llego con 87% de todo lo dem√°s bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buena est√©tica."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Salvo por un peque√±isimo ray√≥n en el lado derecho el tel√©fono es espectacular! Ten√≠a un iphone 6 s y ya no aguantaba jaja, el upgrade fue buen√≠simo, ven√≠a con cargador gen√©rico pero carga en 2 horas y le puedo dar f√°cilmente 12 horas de uso continuo. La pila llegando estaba al 90%, me esper√© meses para escribir esta rese√±a y ¬°la pila sigue estando en 90%! Eso si, no lo utilizo cuando esta cargando para nada. Ven√≠a ya con protector para la parte de enfrente y de atr√°s, as√≠ que lo pude comenzar a utilizar sin miedo de que se rayara (solo tiene una mica delgada, pero hace el trabajo), en general muy buen producto!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En buenas condiciones generales, pila al 90% un ligero rasp√≥n en la pantalla, fuera de eso bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update: the seller of this phone is truly dismal as far as warranty goes. They refused all contact, did not offer any customer support or anything to help fix my phone, not even a new screen protector! The return date has passed and I regret not returning it. It was a desperate purchase and I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. The warranty is non-existent, customer support also, non-existent. Changing to 1 starThe phone works and I REALLY needed a phone, so I kept it. It seems like the prices keep going up! But, I was under the impression that the phone was completely refurbished and ‚Äòlike new‚Äô condition.It came with two noticeable cracks at the top of the screen, fortunately they don‚Äôt effect most of the screen and they don‚Äôt go across the camera.The battery doesn‚Äôt charge past 54% even when I use it plugged in, it just doesn‚Äôt work.It worries me a lot for how long my phone will work for the future and it‚Äôs extremely disappointing.If I had any choice I would not have kept it but my old iPhone had died and I was desperate. It had a few problems connecting but it worked and once it connected, all my pics and vids, contacts etc came back (yay!).I contacted the company, they asked for pics of all the sides of the phone (which was kind of weird) but then they never replied back.It was very disappointing and a real lapse of customer service. They definitely don‚Äôt offer any assistance with warranty or advice about what to do with product problems.It was quite the dropped ball and if you have an option for another phone, go for that one. I don‚Äôt have any confidence in how long this one will last and zero confidence in their ability to refurbish or honor their warranties."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was hesitant to buy a refurbished iphone but except for the box and some new offbrand charging cords/ear phones, it is in perfect working order and looks/operates like it is fresh out of the store.4 out of 5 for the value because phones are too expensive across all brands.. my god.This was a solid purchase though."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una buena compra, me lleg√≥ con 94% de bater√≠a en excelentes condiciones, sin ralladuras, ni defectos. Llevo 4 meses con √©l y funciona correctamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo √∫nico ‚Äúmalo‚Äù ser√≠a el cargador gen√©rico con el que viene ya que carga demasiado lento. Pero bueno, es reacondicionado, ni Apple te lo da con cargador jaja. Fuera de eso, est√©ticamente y funcionalmente lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y con una condici√≥n de bater√≠a en 91%. Todo excelente y sin ning√∫n inconveniente, incluso hasta lleg√≥ 3 d√≠as despu√©s de realizar mi compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone me lleg√≥ sin ning√∫n problema cosm√©tico aparente y con bater√≠a del 93%, cargador gen√©rico de buena calidad. Satisfecha con mi compra!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si tuviera un poco m√°s la vida de la bater√≠a de lo mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, nunca hab√≠a tenido un Iphone, tenia mi desconfianza si comprarlo, pero ya despu√©s de un mes vi√©ndolo llego en perfectas condiciones, claro trae cargador gen√©rico no iba a llegar con el original, aunque puedes comprar el original por separado despu√©s, la pantalla est√° muy bien y el tel√©fono no tiene ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, solo tengan cuidado es muy ligero y resbaladizo recomiendo comprar alguna funda y mica para mayor protecci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ped√≠ el celular a la tiende de IVECSA STORE con algo de miedo por leer que mando productos que no eran lo que ped√≠an y en todos el problema era de paqueter√≠a de Amazon me arriesgu√© y lo ped√≠ mi sorpresa fue que mi celular jam√°s a sido abierto esta como de f√°brica √≥sea NO ES REACONDICIONADO, el √∫nico detalle que tiene es unos m√≠nimos rayones en la pantalla que con la mica no se ven, estoy muy contento con mi compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene muy bien empacando, ven√≠a con cristal templado al quit√°rselo ten√≠a unos raspones en la pantalla de la parte superior derecha no afecta en nada, todo lo dem√°s est√° muy bien cuidado el celular, bateria un 88%, lo he estado usando casi 14 d√≠as y va muy bien, hasta ahora nada de fallos y si busca un iPhone este es el indicador calidad precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno el equipo, no tengo problemas con el, llevo una semana us√°ndolo y parece estar en √≥ptimas condiciones. Trae detalles est√©ticos como rayones en la pantalla y en una de las c√°maras. Bater√≠a viene al 88% y creo que de ah√≠ en fuera est√° bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio por un iPhone en buenas condiciones.Detalladamente agregar√© lo siguiente: el tel√©fono fue recibido en buenas condiciones de embalaje , al abrir la caja te encuentras una caja gen√©rica sellada , dentro el iPhone, cargador y cable , est√©ticamente el tel√©fono estaba en excelentes condiciones casi inmaculado dir√≠a yo , con algunos peque√±os rayoncitos en el marco del tel√©fono sin embargo me lleve la sorpresa qu√© al retirar el cristal templado qu√© ya viene instalado al llegar el iPhone , con rayones muy notorios y profundos en toda la pantalla, que llegan a restar mucho a la est√©tica general del equipo , hab√≠a le√≠do qu√© estos iPhone ya tra√≠an ese cristal templado instalado para precisamente cubrir esos rayones y que pasen desapercibidos, y puedo confirmar que es cierto .Bater√≠a llego en 92 % , bocinas, micr√≥fonos y c√°maras funcionando perfectamente, viene liberado , si embargo no funciona con redes Altan .Sin embargo pasados unos d√≠as, comenc√© a notar qu√© en la parte inferior trasera del tel√©fono apreci√≥ una peque√±a abertura qu√© me hacia dudar si el tel√©fono estaba bien sellado y ante la incertidumbre de pensar que pudiera hacerse m√°s grande decid√≠ regresar el tel√©fono.En general recomendar√≠a este tel√©fono si quieres un iPhone a bajo costo, sin embargo tendr√°s que conformarte con los peque√±os detalles que pudieran aparecer con el paso del tiempo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve duda de comprarlo pero al final llego con est√©tica de 10 y con bater√≠a de 84"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bater√≠a al 80%Al leer otras rese√±as ten√≠a expectativas muy altasPens√© que en verdad est√©ticamente se ver√≠a divinoPero en la parte frontal de la pantalla arriba de la cara est√° como raspado o como si fuera defecto al poner de nuevo la pantallaLigeros tallones que no se ven en la orden dorada del marco por el cargadorHasta ahora me funciona bien tengo poco con el actualizo despu√©sSiento que me cost√≥ un poco m√°s que si comprara uno de uso del mismo modelo por otro ladoEs mi primer iPhone desde el iPhone 4 siempre hab√≠a usado Samsung, pens√© que me decpcionariaPero la verdad es que est√° muy bien en cuanto funciones el dual sim jam√°s funciono no entra el chip as√≠ que lo uso como uni sim"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cargador con el que lo enviaron dej√≥ de funcionar dos semanas despu√©s. Pero en si, el tel√©fono funciona muy bien y no ten√≠a ning√∫n detalle est√©tico."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La pantalla lleg√≥ rayada y con golpes"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente calidad y precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 3 d√≠as con el est√° funcionando al 100% nomas que llego con unos pocos rayones en la pantalla, no afectan y con la bater√≠a al 87%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Quede muy satisfecho con el producto, pr√°cticamente pareciera que es nuevo, solo tiene un muy ligero rasp√≥n en la parte superior pero causado por el case de ah√≠ en fuera la pantalla impecable y el funcionamiento muy bueno. Ten√≠a mis dudas de comprar por algunos comentarios, pero al final fue una buena decisi√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es Original, al principio pens√© que la antena estaba da√±ada, despu√©s me di cuenta que estaba poniendo al rev√©s el SIM, las condiciones del equipo son muy buenas, la bater√≠a tiene 100% de retenci√≥n de carga, aunque la pantalla viene demasiado rayada y algunas muy profundas y muy notorias"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad tenia algo de miedo leyendo algunos de los comentarios menos favorables. Pero me anime ya que vi que se podr√≠an hacer devoluciones y que se tenia buena comunicaci√≥n con el vendedor. El producto me llego en una caja x, y con un adaptador de corriente x como bien lo dicen en la publicaci√≥n. El iPhone llego nuevecito y al prenderlo llego casi al 100% de bater√≠a y con la nueva actualizaci√≥n no me lleve ninguna sorpresa para mal.Dure adem√°s varios d√≠as esperando ya que manejan meses sin intereses pero creo debe uno estar atento para cuando los ponen ya que solo duran unos d√≠as y luego sin meses y luego vuelven."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto ven√≠a como nuevo con 95% de bater√≠a, solo algunos raspones en el area de alrededor de las c√°maras pero nada que afecte en su funcionamiento, el celular funciono con mi compa√±√≠a celular y en general no tengo ning√∫n pero, como si lo hubiera comprado nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone lleg√≥ en una excelente condici√≥n , est√©tica 9/10, ligeras marcas de uso en los marcos que solamente se aprecian si observas muy de cerca.La pantalla muy bien, inclu√≠a una mica, al removerla se observan ligeras marcas de uso en la pantalla que √∫nicamente son apreciables sin la mica y solo si observas muy de cerca y con una luz fuerte.La parte trasera y la c√°mara est√°n impecables, ni un solo ray√≥n ni una sola marca de uso.La bater√≠a llego al 96%C√≥mo es de esperarse llego en una caja gen√©rica con cable y cargadores gen√©ricos pero no es problema por que f√°cilmente puedes comprar los oficiales de Apple.En general muy satisfecho, es buena opci√≥n para conseguir un dispositivo de este tipo y ahorra un poco de dinero"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone que me lleg√≥ viene en excelentes condiciones lo he probado varios d√≠as y no tengo queja la bater√≠a estaba al 100% y muy bien cuidado!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","la verdad el equipo llego en excelentes condiciones, sin ning√∫n tipo de detalles y funcionando perfectamente.no teman a comprar productos reacondicionados, la verdad est√°n muy bien y a un excelente precio."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compr√© mi iPhone 11 pro max de 256 gb con un poco de temor. Evidentemente el producto es un equipo ¬´seminuevo¬ª o como dice el vendedor ¬´renewed¬ª. Sin embargo, mi sorpresa fue que me lleg√≥ un tel√©fono en muy buenas condiciones. La bater√≠a al 93% y con una est√©tica my buena. La pantalla vino con un cristal templado pre-instalado, que al cambiarlo por otro, me pude percatar que la pantalla tiene algunos peque√±os rayones, pero nada que impida disfrutar del tel√©fono. Lo que si hay que decir, el cargador (cubo) es una burla, de muy mala calidad, lo √∫nico rescatable fue el cable lightning. No tuve mucho problema, por que lo cargo con el cargador de mi iPad (20w) lo que hace que funcione la carga r√°pida.Estoy por cumplir un mes con el equipo, si tuviera un comentario adicional, actualizo mi rese√±a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues with the phone, battery life is as expected more high engery applications used drain the battery. On everyday things like telephone and text messages it will last all day. I'd certainly buy another phone from Amazon"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buen producto me llego como nuevo y tiene muy buen funcionamiento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bater√≠a 84%Est√©tica solo ten√≠a un rasgu√±o en el marcoTodo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was a bit nervous to order a refurbished phone for all the obvious reasons but a 90 day return policy gave me confidence to try. The phone arrived in a plain box, well packaged. It was immaculate, no marks and battery life was good. I would consider buying another refurbished phone in the future."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice budget iPhone 11 pro max and that too with 92% battery capacity left."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto en general viene muy bien, no da√±ado ni maltratado, no rasgu√±os la capacidad de la bater√≠a es de 92% lo √∫nico malo es que la pantalla no es la original de apple; se nota en la calidad de los colores"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tiene muchas funcionalidades y se pueden aprovechar al maximo. El dise√±o y colir increinle"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El env√≠o fue rapid√≠simo, mas que en otras compras que eh realizado, el producto la verdad supero mis expectativas por mucho, muy buena compra realmente, no tenia o al menos no le note ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, la vida de la bater√≠a llego al 85% pero me rinde mejor que otro que tenia con vida de 90%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es un buen telefono, sin da√±os, la bocina se escucha muy bien, pero al recibirlo no traia cargador y menciona que si venia incluido, necesito investigar como reportarlo al proveedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el color el servicio lo importante es funcional y te ahorras muchos pesos la est√©tica me sali√≥ 9/10 que es genial por el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ en perfecto estado, bater√≠a al 100% ning√∫n ray√≥n o golpe es como si fuera nuevo, recomiendo totalmente al vendedor ivecsa store ; anteriormente hab√≠a comprado uno de buyspry en color plata pero llego rayado del marco y con una abolladura cerca de la c√°mara que le dej√≥ una marca como ‚Äúburbuja‚Äù en el cristal , ese mismo d√≠a ped√≠ la devoluci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular me llego con una calidad impecable, pr√°cticamente como nuevo ning√∫n da√±o f√≠sico ni raspadura en pantalla.Bater√≠a al 90Lo he usado casi el mes y sin problemasEstoy muy satisfecho con la compraCargador y cable de buena calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve mis dudas antes de comprarlo, pero estoy mas que satisfecho con el estado del tel√©fono. Pr√°cticamente es un equipo nuevo. Y lo que me animo al final fue el respaldo de Amazon. No ser√° el √∫ltimo que compre en Renewed. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüéâ"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ con 87 de bater√≠a pero la verdad es que ni se nota , la bater√≠a me dura todo el d√≠a.Ven√≠a con cargador gen√©rico pero no se ha calentado ni nada extra√±o."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pues la verdad quede muy contenta con mi compra. Llego al otro d√≠a de mi pago, ven√≠a en una caja sencilla pero bien protegido, tra√≠a una mica de cristal y un proyector de pl√°stico, tra√≠a la herramientita para abrir el porta chip, el cargador si se ve medio chafa jaja pero pues ah√≠ dec√≠a que gen√©rico y cumple su funci√≥n, ven√≠a con la bater√≠a al 97%, si viene liberado, le puse chip Telcel en Mexico y esta todo en orden, Llevo us√°ndolo 3 d√≠as y estoy s√∫per contenta, me lo regale de cumplea√±os. La verdad quer√≠a comprarlo por otro lado pero pues si era mucho dinero y pues tem√≠a que me robaran, entonces me decid√≠ por Amazon ya que promete garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as y devuelven todo el dinero, entonces por eso confi√©, ojal√° no falle el celular, pero la verdad viene casi como nuevo, solo tiene 2 mini rasgu√±itos casi imperceptibles en una orilla de la pantalla, as√≠ que no creo que le pase nada."

I was suprised the phone was perfect :) now i can see why those people are thinking the 5 star reviews are fake and in my experience the phone is mint, nonproblems and I popped in my bell sim card and worked perfect.. I did a full exam on the phone and everything works like new, only regret is not getting 512 gb version because it was only $10 more but I don't think I'll need all those gigs anyway"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Este producto vino muy bien a la excepcion de de un detalle. Al momento de usar la camara del telefono este empieza a hacer ruido y la camara vibra. Esto no permite tomar fotos ni videos adecuadamente."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono me lleg√≥ con el 86% de vida √∫til de la bater√≠a, est√©ticamente esta perfecto excepto una esquina de la pantalla que tiene rayado como cuando traes el tel√©fono y tambi√©n las llaves y se va rayando con el movimiento, eso no me gusto porque he tenido iPhone por a√±os y nunca se me han rayado as√≠, no afecta en su funcionamiento y todo internamente funciona bien"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En general esta en buen estado, 85% de bater√≠a al llegar, funciona bien pero al poco tiempo comenz√≥ a trabarse, a tener peque√±as fallas que se presentaron cada vez de forma m√°s frecuente.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pondr√≠a 5 estrellas pero la pantalla tra√≠a unas ligeras rayas. Lo bueno es que ya con la mica de hidrogel mate no se notan. Estuve a punto de devolverlo pero finalmente me lo qued√© y funciona bien. Solo eso, las rayas en la pantalla."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es mi primera compra en Amazon Renewed, BuySpry sigan vendiendo iphones en este estado y volver√© a comprar con ustedes. Mi iphone 11 pro m√°x lleg√≥ en excelente estado f√≠sico y operativo pila al 91% llevo un d√≠a con el y al momento no ha fallado, espero siga as√≠. Productos con excelente est√©tica y funcionamiento correcto no tienen porque ser devueltos. El vendedor resuelve muy r√°pido los cuestionamientos."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm very happy with this phone so far, mine came with no scratches, battery at 97%, a screen and lens film protectors already installed. The charger was not Apple, but I'm using one I had from an older iPhone. From all the sellers, I picked one here in Canada with overnight shipping -- this one came from ""Westend Enterprises Inc"", and fullfilled by Amazon. I didn't want to take any chances with those shipped from the States."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tel√©fono de muy baja calidad, b√°sicamente dir√© que es una porquer√≠a, para lo que cuesta hay mejor opci√≥n! Esta s√∫per reacondicionado y tiene piezas gen√©ricas (piratas)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Three months ago, I bought this white iPhone 11 Pro Max, when I got it, I felt so excited, it was like brand new, no scratch, battery life was 97%, so great! I love it so much! But after 3 months later, now the battery life is only 88%, it dropped down so fast, not usual. I asked my friend, she bought iPhone 12 last year, Black Friday, until now, still 100% battery life, so jealous of her. Anyway, I love iPhone, but this made me disappointed. Maybe I was bad luck. :("
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en excelentes condiciones, tenia dudas sobre todo con la pila porque habia comentarios buenos y algunos malos, pero esta muy bonito traia una estetica de 9.9 la pila estaba al 100, llego en caja que generica con cargador igual, pero lo uso con otro que ya tenia y esta muy bien la carga le dura mucho mas que al SE 2020 definitivamente lo volveria a comprar solo hay que revisar el vendedor, se anuncian muchos pero no todos tienen buenos comentarios algunos ni siquiera los envian."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo est√° como nuevo, su est√©tica podr√≠a decirse perfecta; bater√≠a al 96% y hasta el momento funciona muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ten√≠a mis dudas por ser un equipo reacondicionado, lleg√≥ justo a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones.
Como nuevo ya con mica en la pantalla, cargador y cable.
Recomiendo mucho comprar en BUYSPRY"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lo compre hace un par de d√≠as por que me anime a cambiarme a iPhone y quer√≠a algo ""nuevo"" el tel√©fono venia con una mica cristal impecable al igual que la pantalla y la parte trasera del tel√©fono pero la parte de los lados parec√≠a que se la hab√≠an metido por el culo al anterior due√±o estaba muy rayado hasta al punto en que pens√© que le hab√≠an pasado una lija y seamos honestos obvio que por el precio vale la versi√≥n del tel√©fono pero no creo que valga la pena pagar 17k o 15k para que este tan rayado y parezca que lo arrastraron por el piso, se que me dir√°n que mientras el dispositivo sirva no importa lo dem√°s pero si en alg√∫n momento lo quieres vender eso le bajara valor al producto por que ya esta rayado al igual que la bater√≠a no venia tan mal contaba con 89% de uso :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta rese√±a la escribo despues de un tiempo de uso, el equipo lleg√≥ bien sin rayones aparentes con mica, retire la mica y ten√≠a rayones de uso, esto personalmente no me molest√≥ lo que si no me gusto y termin√≥ en devoluci√≥n fue la degradaci√≥n r√°pida de la bater√≠a, me llego con un 98% y en menos de un mes se fue a 96, luego 94 y en dos meses y medio ten√≠a 90% hice la calibraci√≥n y quedo en el mismo porcentaje adem√°s de ser notorio al uso, nunca lo us√© mientras se cargaba y usaba un cargador apple que yo tengo que no es carga r√°pida (he tenido y tengo productos apple) asi que no le di mal usl que el normal sin jugar juegos pesados (jam√°s se calent√≥) supongo sali√≥ mal la pila... No creo que sea asi en todos los renovados as√≠ que si los recomiendo pero chequenlos muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week because my old iPhone 6S was on its way out. It arrived on Sunday, and I was worried that it wasn‚Äôt going to be as advertised. When I opened the box and saw the phone, I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs in nearly perfect condition, with very few unnoticeable scratches at the top. The battery health is at 100% and it lasts a long time without needing a charge. I cannot express how thrilled I am with this purchase, and I am very happy that I decided to buy it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got mine today, product is brand new, was wrapped, came with charger etc... Did not come in original box, but who cares. The only issue is that when I insert the SIM card the carrier is detected but not active, try resetting network settings, SIM port looks very clean and tried with 2 SIM cards with 2 different Canadian carriers. I think the phone is still locked with the previous carrier (my opinion) I have sent an email to the seller and awaiting an answer. This is my reason for 2 stars cause product is not working as expected. But will change depending on resolutions."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre este tel√©fono para mi uso diario y quede muy contento, ya era la segunda vez que compro as√≠ un dispositivo y realmente me a encantado como llega el dispositivo, sin rayones, la pantalla en perfecta condici√≥n, su bater√≠a con una alto porcentaje de vida a√∫n, muy contento la verdad. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No llevo los 3 meses y se prende y se apaga, me podr√≠an apoyar en c√≥mo podr√≠a hacer el cambio o reembolso? Por favor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo en bater√≠a tiene una integridad del 100%, la carcasa est√° en perfectas condiciones sin el m√≠nimo ray√≥n o golpe, pero la pantalla s√≠ se encontraba con muchos rayones ocasionados por llaves o herramientas, inclusive uno de ellos est√° profundo justo en la posici√≥n del lente en la c√°mara frontal. En ciertos √°ngulos la luz se ve un m√≠nimo reflejada por el ray√≥n. No afecta su funcionamiento y con una mica de cristal o hidrogel se cubren los rayones. El cargador y cable son gen√©ricos y la caja a su vez es gen√©rica de buena calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo un mes con el equipo llego bien una buena est√©tica , bater√≠a del 86% hasta el momento sin fallas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, el Face ID fall√≥ como a los 2 meses pero todo en orden"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en s√∫per buenas condiciones, sin ning√∫n detalle y la bater√≠a arriba del 90%. S√∫per satisfecho con mi compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me la rif√© leyendo varios comentarios que unos equipos no jalaban bien o despues de unos dias no tenia se√±al pero la verdad el que me mandaron esta casi nuevo. Y tiene 100% de vida la pila. Tengo casi 2 semanas de usarlo y asta ahorita jala bien. Solo un dia que sali si tenia se√±al pero no entravan ni salian llamadas ni datos. Pero solo me meti ala pagina d mitelcel(tengo telcel) y lo registre como decia un papelito que venia con el cell. Nose si fue por eso o de plano se callo la red por un momento. t√≠pico Telcel siemple que se batala cuando llueve o esta bien nublado. Ensi no se si pueda recomendarlo tomando encuenta los otros compradores y no todos los ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù estan identicos. Aveses asta los nuevos salen fallando de la fabrica pero lo bueno que ai siempre te daran otro nuevo. Aqui te ariesgas ala condicion que lo maden. üòÖ
Lo bueno que tienen un mes si no vale la pena"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llego en caja gen√©rica y cargador gen√©rico funcional, la capacidad de bater√≠a llego en 86% , detalles est√©ticos casi nulos, la bocina se escucha un poco mal, distorsionada en volumen algo, si sale otro detalle me plantear√© el devolverlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo en perfecto estado, me encanto.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo regrese porque no cumpl√≠a con los est√°ndares que comenta la publicaci√≥n. Mala calidad, no parece nuevo y el estado de la bater√≠a estaba en 79%. Realice la devoluci√≥n y el comprador muy buena atenci√≥n me hicieron el reembolso cuando revieron mi art√≠culo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","muy buenas condiciones , bateria al 89% sin raspones ni nada"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fue mi primera experiencia comprando renewed y mi iPhone lleg√≥ impecable! Obvio no lleg√≥ en su caja original ni accesorios originales pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con el 100% de bater√≠a y hasta con mica para la pantalla. Lo √∫nico que me qued√≥ ligeramente insatisfecho es que el cable que ven√≠a no tiene informaci√≥n que corrobore que es MFI pero fuera de eso, llega empaquetado super bien. Si le vuelvo a comprar a Buyspry!
Cabe resaltar que lo compr√© por Abril y para Octubre sigue totalmente funcional."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compr√© este celular el 23 de Junio del 2021
Hago este comentario el 19 de Septiembre casi 3 meses de usarlo, hasta el momento todo muy bien, sin ning√∫n detalle grave de uso o da√±o, solo trae dos ralloncitos en la pantalla, nada que disguste.
Defin√≠ no viene con cargador, ni caja original pero la verdad que no pasa nada, el cargador funciona mucho m√°s r√°pido que el de mi iPad. As√≠ que te evitas gastarte m√°s dinero por un original.
Hasta el momento pienso que fue una muy buena compra.
Saludos!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ bien, tal cual dice la publicaci√≥n, equipo seminuevo, vida de la bater√≠a 82%, equipo con Mica en la pantalla, cargador y usb gen√©rico, y todo funcionando a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estetica de 10, pero al probarlo unos dias, no tarda nada , tiene 82% de batera, ya tiene 12 dias que lo devolv√≠ y no me dan mi reembolso, pesimo servicio."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone would constantly cut internet and phone calls. Brought it in and was told that antenna was probably damaged. I returned it with no issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo funciona y opera correctamente conforme a especificaciones del fabricante. Sin embargo, aunque se especifica claramente su condici√≥n de reacondicionado, el equipo lleg√≥ con una mica de cristal pegada a la pantalla, con lo cual se minimiza unas muy leves ralladuras. A lo mejor valdr√≠a la pena publicar im√°genes de los productos reales para los casos de reacondicionados, en vez de im√°genes de cat√°logo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo he usado ya por un mes, esta en excelentes condiciones, llego con 91% de bateria, es suerte, pedi otros dos y llegaron con 86 y 81, los devolvi y al tercero llego otro del 90%, es cuestion de arriesgarse pero todo excelente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relaci√≥n CALIDAD PRECIO es aceptable , la bater√≠a est√° al 90% ( lleg√≥ con el 91 hace un mes ) , pero siendo un iPhone ya es conocido que as√≠ es la cosa , tengo que mencionar que me lleve un susto cuando quise al empezar a respaldar el celular a este nuevo ME APAREC√çA EL ANTERIOR DUE√ëO DEL APARATO , yo cre√≠ que estaba totalmente borrado , o su no se si sea parte del funcionamiento , la cosa es que hoy mi celular est√° funcionando AL 100% en todas sus cosas sin nada raro , ( que bueno todos los iPhones que he tenido siempre tienen repentinamente alg√∫n completamiento extra√±o por alg√∫n momento ) que le atribuyo al IOS de Apple ... LO RECOMIENDO , por cierto todo en tiempo y forma .üëçüèº"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 mes con el desde septiembre , Lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones, como nuevo est√©ticamente solo la bater√≠a lleg√≥ en 89% y en 1 mes baj√≥ a 86% pero creo que es por el cargador se tiene que comprar el original, todo lo dem√°s va bien, todas las piezas que tiene son originales"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ un iPhone original en muy buen estado el √∫nico detalle fue la pantalla que estaba muy rayada pero con la mica ya no se le ven las marcas hasta ahora todo bien y la bater√≠a llego al 88 porciento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre el equipo y todo iba perfecto hasta que me di cuenta que se calentaba, a veces lo hac√≠a cuando ve√≠a Facebook o instagram, pasaba en momentos completamente aleatorios. A veces se calentaba demasiado y solo se enfr√≠aba hasta que lo apagaba, sin duda tuve que devolverlo por miedo a que la bater√≠a empeorar√° muy r√°pido por esto mismo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° como nuevo y funciona perfecto, sin golpes ni rayones. El √∫nico detalle que yo mencionar√≠a es que la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° al 85%, yo esperaba al menos arriba de 90%, pero bueno la descripci√≥n del producto lo advierte."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego a tiempo, todo bien hasta ahorita y la bater√≠a me llego a 86 para el precio eso no me agrada tanto:/"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ con est√©tica de 10 y 97 en la bater√≠a.
Apenas llevo 4 d√≠as de uso y todo perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En realidad, m√°s que venderte un producto renovado por alg√∫n detalle, lo que te venden es un producto de segunda mano. En mi caso, el equipo incluso viene con una mica protectora y en los bordes se nota algo de suciedad, es decir, ni siquiera lo limpiaron. Por otro lado, la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a es de un 85% (vida √∫til promedio de los equipos que amigos o conocidos tienen actualmente y que adquirieron cuando el producto sali√≥ al mercado)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encant√≥ todo, parece nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n detalle, la bater√≠a al 100% solo por el cargador y la caja que no son originales, pero el equipo sin duda una maravilla, la mejor compra que pude haber hecho, gracias al vendedor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First week i was super happy with my phone. But now its been two months or so, and i have realized a bunch of flaws which you guys should be aware of

Firstly, my phones actual screen isn‚Äôt authentic. Its very obviously third party. Has a weird feel, doesnt operate as smoothly as an original would

Second of all, the battery is third party as well. Iphones are advertised as fast charge, up to 50% charge within first 30 mins. I spent 50-100$ on a fast charge cable and charging block from Anker. The phone charges superrrr slow. Takes well over an hour to even reach 50% charge.

And i have to constantly turn phone on airplane mode, and turn it back off. Because the phones internet/services stop working multiple times per day. Ive had 5+ iphones in my life, never ever encountered this before.

There are other things too but i dont wana make this review an essay. I highly do not recommend buying from this supplier. Truly disappointed with the product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenia mis dudas de comprar un producto usado, mas al hablar de algo como un iPhone, pero el celular me llego en tres d√≠as, pr√°cticamente esta nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n defecto , la bater√≠a al 100%.
Creo que realize una excelente compra puesto que al compara el precio de uno nuevo con este usado hay mucha diferencia y en lo que respecta a calidad y est√©tica en el usado, pr√°cticamente ninguna. Volver√≠a a comprar."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, solo que no mencionaron que ten√≠a una falla en el Face ID, sab√≠a que no compraba un celular nuevo, pero una herramienta as√≠ ese esencial en el tel√©fono hay que mencionarlas, por lo dem√°s quedo satisfecho."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular es de lo mejor que he tenido, la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a es una bestialidad 10/10"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tallado en la esquina Con ligeros detalles exteriores calificaci√≥n 8 de 10"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es lo que esperaba segun la descripcion del producto, tenia una caja generica, bien empacado, cargador (5W) y cable genericos, no incluye audifonos, tegngo usandolo dos semanas y todo bien hasta ahora, ya actualice a 14.5, la pantalla y la parte de atras bien, unas rayas y golpes en las esquinas. Bocina, entradas y camara bien, la maxima capacidad de la bateria estaba en 94%, ahora es 93, solo me decepciono la bateria (por eso las 4 estrellas), en general lo recomendaria."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cel est√° es buenas condiciones est√©ticas, funciona muy bien, viene con cargador gen√©rico, la bater√≠a tiene muy buen estado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","bateria al 88% todo lo demas perfecto como nuevo, si problemas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es la 2da vez que lo pido, la primera venia con 83%de bater√≠a y lo devolv√≠, este vino como nuevo,.y 90% de bater√≠a, lo recomiendo de verdad excelente opci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llega en condiciones buenas, la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 92% lo √∫nico malo es el cargador dice que es el que debe de llevar pero se ve de muy mala c√°lida al igual que el cable."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","muy bueno solo raspones en lo laterales y el cargador es de muy mala calidad, deber√≠a integra uno certificado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto ! Me llego con un 97% de vida de bater√≠a ahora tengo 94 dos meses despu√©s. Pero en lo funcional 10/10 muy bonito como nuevo! Si buscas un tel√©fono por un precio razonable es tu opci√≥n. :)"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llego s√∫per bien solo con un par de rayones en la pantalla pero nada de que preocuparse, por todo lo dem√°s esta muy bien, la pila est√° al 91%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La calidad es premium como lo dice el anuncio, solo el pago de env√≠o si es m√°s costoso en esta aplicaci√≥n que en otras"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","93% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Ninguna falla."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I must say that in the beginning I was worried to buy it, once I received it everything was working like if it‚Äôs brand new and I must say WOW. I highly recommend it if you need a new phone!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le t√©l√©phone est super, j'h√©sitait un peu avant de le prendre ,mais quand je l'ai re√ßu , j'ai vu qu'il est compl√®tement neuf.La couleur est magnifique . Qualit√©-prix parfait,le produits en vaut vraiment la peine ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 d√≠a us√°ndolo, hasta el momento lleg√≥ bien, no tiene ning√∫n detalle, m√°s que unos cuantos rayones en la pantalla, si eres muy exigente, no te lo recomiendo, pero si puedes pasar de unos rayoncitos, es perfecto, 100% recomendado
La bater√≠a llego con el 88%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo pero no viene 3n su empaque original y no tiene el cargador original."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien buen servicio del cliente quien atendi√≥ amablemente una solicitud"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente 91% de bater√≠a sin rayones En pantalla ni en ninguna parte, estoy esperando √∫nicamente la factura y fuera de que el cargador no es original estoy totalmente encantado con que el dispositivo llegara en tan buenas condiciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, con peque√±as marcas de uso, pero nada exagerado..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono ven√≠a con 87% de bater√≠a y est√©tica de 10 no ten√≠a rayones solo que lo env√≠an en caja gen√©rica y cargadores gen√©ricos mi compra fue con clevermex recomendado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","99% de bater√≠a, componentes originales, totalmente impecable, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo compre hace poco pero hasta hoy todo perfectos, se calienta un poco al cargar pero supongo es normal, est√©tica 10, c√°maras 10, todo va muy bien me gusta mucho . Espero siga as√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Porque no se aseguran del correcto funcionamiento de estos equipos renewed? es el segundo que recibo con la misma falla, el primero de plano no se escuchaba y en este caso se escucha muy bajito, obligando a abrir el altavoz para sostener una llamada telefonica, evidentemente esto no siempre es posible.
Necesito que me lo cambien por uno que funcione correctamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se encuentra como si fuera nuevo, no unico es que a mi llego con 86% de pila y el cable y el cubo es gen√©rico, pero en lo demas aspectos lo Recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had some problems with the phone,
First off; the screen protector was cracked when received - I was shocked and thought the screen itself was broken
but I think its only the protector thats cracked.
Second off; the phone did not register to the service provider for a bit
I had to call them to ""activate"" the phone to get it to turn on LTE and stuff otherwise its ok."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno como nuevo solo que enviaron cargador viejo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reci√©n tengo una semana con equipo, hasta ahora todo bien. Me hab√≠a quedado bastante atr√°s, ten√≠a un Iphone 6s plus y un 8 Plus, as√≠ que estoy contenta con el cambio. Considerando que s√≥lo me interesan funciones b√°sicas de redes sociales y fotos, estoy satisfecha con la compra. La bater√≠a lleg√≥ con una capacidad m√°xima al 96% lo cual est√° muy razonable por el precio. Actualizo comentarios en un par de meses."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relaci√≥n entre calidad y precio es muy buena, pero debo admitir que el cargador con el que viene el tel√©fono, es gen√©rico y no tiene aud√≠fonos, entonces si hacemos la suma de esos dos art√≠culos es de aproximadamente 3 mil pesos que tienes que agregar al valor final del equipo. Just for your information."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto me lleg√≥ en menos de 2 dias, estetica 9.8 ya que la bateria contaba con 87%, peque√±os rayones pero nada de que preocuparse. La verdad es muy recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not a single scratch or blemish on the device, product took about 4-5 days coming from Texas to Ontario. Battery life was 87%. Love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the phone is like new, no scratches, the battery condition is 94%, the camera works great, no bugs and takes great photos, the picture quality is good, the sound is good , the storage capacity is 256 GB as I had chosen and the iPhone is official I am happy with my purchase, the only disappointment is to pay $ 1100 and receive a 5W charger and not an 18W charger for fast charging. I recommend this product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El precio sigue siendo alto para ser un equipo que se le han cambiado piezas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo esta super bien, funciona perfectamente sin problemas, sin estrellados todo muy bien. Lo unico que deberian tener en cuenta es la pila a mi me vino con el 88% pero me ha estado durando la pila y dia completo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ en caja gen√©rica con un cargador de otra marca pero con el plus que es de carga r√°pida, (cargador que Apple no te d√° cuando compras el tel√©fono por cierto). El tel√©fono est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo con la vida de bater√≠a al 100%. Supongo que es suerte porque √©ste celular lleg√≥ impecable pero tambi√©n compr√© un iPhone xs plata y ese celular lleg√≥ desgastado de los costados, rayas m√≠nimas en la pantalla y bater√≠a al 81%. No s√© de que dependa..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo excelente me llego con un 89% de bater√≠a sin ning√∫n ray√≥n le quite la mica que trae puesta para ver si trae ara√±azos la pantalla tra√≠a una pero no se ve al ponerle el cristal templado y sin el cristal tienes que buscarla bien al reflejo de la Luz para que se note lo recomiendo totalmente llego con cargador y caja gen√©rica que al final del d√≠a eso no me preocupa debido a que lo cargo con su cargador original"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","will definitely buy again from your guys! 1100 cad plus tax for iPhone 11 Pro Max 512gb! That‚Äôs amazing! And the battery life is 100%! Not sure how but that‚Äôs so great! Also it looks like a completely new phone no scratch no dents at all and it comes with a screen protector! Thanks you guys!! Appreciate it!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ven√≠a un poco rayado pero lo disimulan con una mica y se calentaba, pero al actualizarlo se compuso el sobrecalentamiento, y las rayaduras eran detalles m√≠nimos"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hasta ahorita me funciona excelentemente bien la bateria me dura 2 dias. Mi pregunta es si es resistente al agua."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono viene con cargador gen√©rico, no viene en caja original. El tel√©fono me vino con mica y el porcentaje de vida de la bateria es de un 88%. Est√©ticamente se ve como nuevo y no le veo ning√∫n detalle, todo funciona de manera correcta."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° perfecto, funciona como nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El √∫nico detalle es que la vida de la pila es muy bajo 85% quedo decepcionado, intente devolver el producto pero no me dej√≥. Primera y √∫ltima vez que compro equipo reacondicionado."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con bater√≠a al 91% ni un solo rasgu√±o parece nuevo, una ganga el precio muy muy contento con la compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° perfecto, aunque la primera vez que lo ped√≠ me enviaron unas toallitas h√∫medas y tuve que pedir mi reembolso, la atenci√≥n al cliente por parte de Amazon es perfecta. Lo volv√≠ a comprar y por fin lleg√≥ el producto que ped√≠. El tel√©fono ven√≠a con 93 de bater√≠a pero espero que con las semanas de uso se calibre y aumente. La est√©tica es impecable en mi caso y todo funcionando en orden. S√∫per recomendado, pero para que hagas la compra rastrea el precio m√°s bajo y se paciente!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad me daba desconfianza los equipos refurbished, pero llevo ya un par de semanas con mi equipo y en verdad se siente como nuevo. Lleg√≥ bien, r√°pido, sin conflicto, con muy buena est√©tica. Super recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En la mica que trae tapa mucho de los rayones que trae la pantalla, lo cambiaria pero ser√°n muchos problemas para la informaci√≥n que ya le met√≠ al tel√©fono, hay que cuidar m√°s la est√©tica de las pantallas de estos tel√©fonos, por qu√© si bien son usados deben de manejar calidad en los mismos."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Apenas llevo una semana de uso, pero el tel√©fono como nuevo totalmente, tanto f√≠sica como funcionalmente. Lo recomiendo mucho, lleg√≥ con 100% de pila, sin ning√∫n detalle f√≠sico y liberado para cualquier compa√±√≠a (yo uso Telcel) tiene Apple care vigente de un mes a partir de la entrega (al menos as√≠ fue en mi caso)."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se entiende que sea un producto reacondicionado y no es totalmente nuevo, pero al menos en mi caso, me lleg√≥ con una pantalla con bastantes rayones peque√±os (el anterior due√±o seguro lo dejaba con la pantalla en el suelo) y en la descripci√≥n dice que no deber√≠an ser pr√°cticamente nulos o nulos. Lo que no me gust√≥ es que tratan de ocultarlo poni√©ndole una mica protectora para que parezca que no tiene rayones, y es algo enga√±oso.No es mal producto pero en mi opini√≥n les recomiendo que si lo compran, le quiten esa mica para ver las condiciones reales en las que lo env√≠an."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Me encant√≥ de principio a fin!!! No puedo creer que aunque sea renovado tenga la bater√≠a al 100% y con ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, incluso viene con una mica y nunca se ha abierto porque todav√≠a tiene el sello contra el agua (verificado con el barometro) y todas sus piezas obviamente son originales (verificado con un programa, la bater√≠a solo tenka 30 ciclos) por much√≠simo menos dinero de lo que cuesta, es de verdad incre√≠ble"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","POR LA RELACION PRECIO CALIDAD LE DOY UN 10, LLEVO MAS DE 4 MESES USANDOLO Y FUNCIONA A LA PERFECCION Y SIN DETALLES.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Por lo menos a m√≠, mi dispositivo lleg√≥ con un rall√≥n profundo y porcentaje de bateria en 88%.

Cable y centro de carga gen√©rico pero por el precio ahorrarse esos lujos y compensarlo con 512 GB me parece excelente !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo uso para todo, lo mejor es que pude acomodar una l√≠nea de att en forma de chip virtual, y otra de telcel en el chip f√≠sico, y ya no requiero dos aparatos. Realmente estoy muy contento con el equipo, excelentes fotos y videos tambi√©n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√©tica al 100, buena calidad precio. Sin quejas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno, pero ven√≠a algo raspado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al ser un producto re manufacturado estaba consiente de que tendr√≠a algunos desgastes o defectos.

Desgraciadamente al destaparlo me lleve la desagradable sorpresa de que estaba bastante rayada de la pantalla y tra√≠a varios golpes en las orillas del marco met√°lico as√≠ como en las c√°maras.

Los rayones estaban demasiado profundos.

Desgraciadamente estuve fuera de mi domicilio por trabajo bastante tiempo.
Por lo que al regresar y revisar el
Producto perd√≠ el tiempo de devoluci√≥n.

Termine gastando m√°s en cambiar el Glass da√±ado del tel√©fono.

La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 87% y a la fecha se ha mantenido.

Personalmente no vuelvo a comprar renovado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con 87 % de bater√≠a nada mal y solo unas rallas en la pantalla con la mica no s nota nada por el precio esta bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cargador con el que venia solo funcion√≥ 1 mes , y dejo de servir tu e que comprar otro , creo que deber√≠an revisar muy bien los componentes adicionales. El tel√©fono si lleno todas mis expectativas"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","EL telefono esta excelente como si fuera nuevo no se nota la diferencia, y tiene el 92 porciento de rendimiento en la bateria."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo perfecto unas ligeras marcas de uso en la zona de c√°maras pero est√©tica de 9.5 dir√≠a, me llego con 100% de vida de bater√≠a, tendr√© que devolverlo porque mi banco no me respeto la promoci√≥n de reembolso en estado de cuenta :( es una l√°stima pero si lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","F√≠sicamente lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones, sin un s√≥lo ray√≥n. Funcionamiento perfecto. Est√° c√≥mo nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La pantalla estaba muy rallada, estos rayones afectaban la c√°mara frontal y la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a era muy mala"

Amazon renewed pero me arriesgu√© y fue una buena decisi√≥n, lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones
Muy recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La est√©tica de 9.5 bastante buena condici√≥n el producto, la bater√≠a super√≥ por completo mis expectativas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me sorprende lo bien conservado que me llego, hasta el momento sin ningun detalle. Lo √∫nico malo es el cargador y cable."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es un equipo usado por lo que la bater√≠a no llega al 100, pero fuera de eso funciona de maravilla, f√≠sicamente casi no tiene ning√∫n detalle, la caja, el cable y el cargador son gen√©ricos pero por el precio est√° muy bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con rayones es normal por que es renewed y pues es obvio que alguien m√°s lo uso, pero al mes justamente ayer ya no jalo el Face ID y le sali√≥ una raya verde a la pantalla y se apaga y se prende la pantalla cuando quiere lo bueno que alcance a tramitar el reembolso ya que Amazon te da 90 d√≠as de garant√≠a. Espero que los dem√°s si les haya salido muy bien su equipo solo es mi caso en particular."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encanto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de 15 d√≠as de uso continuo funciona como un producto nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Supero mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El √∫nico detalle que tiene en contra es una bater√≠a con 85% de vida, por lo dem√°s, gran tel√©fono"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° en muy buen estado, sin ning√∫n ray√≥n o golpe, est√° en una condici√≥n de 10 y la bater√≠a me llego con 99% , aunque no todo fue del todo bien ya que d√≠as antes hab√≠a pedido el color space gray y me perdieron el paquete, aunque eso ya fue cuesti√≥n de la paqueter√≠a pero en cuanto al tel√©fono ten√≠a mis dudas por comentarios que le√≠ y la verdad es que no me arrepiento, hasta ahora todo funcionando bien y a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo me lleg√≥ en estado impecable.
Se ve como nuevo, no tiene detalles est√©ticos.
Funciona perfectamente. Me lleg√≥ con 98% de vida √∫til de bater√≠a. Recomendado al 100."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto excelente, lamentablemente fui asaltado, me gustar√≠a saber si pueden proporcionarme el n√∫mero de imei para bloquearlo por favor.
Gracias"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta muy bien!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Uno tiene sus reservas cuando hace este tipo de compras, sin embargo cada vez los proveedores van mejorando y √©se es el chiste que cada vez vayan dando m√°s confianza. Es la segunda vez que lo hago, la vez pasada con el Iphone 8, estuvo bien, pero esta vez, me fue mejor. Ojal√° uds tengan a√∫n, una mejor experiencia."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy triste pr que un a√±o despues de estar funcionando el equipo, la pantalla dejo de responder sin causa alguna."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery is less than 90%. The phone is overpriced. It‚Äôs available on Swappa for much less."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me tarde en escribir la rese√±a para poder ver si el iPhone presentaba alguna falla y hasta el d√≠a de hoy todo incre√≠ble, llego con buena bater√≠a (99%) sin ninguna imperfecci√≥n (rapaduras, manchas o golpes) desbloqueado para cualquier compa√±√≠a y sin problemas con iCloud. En pocas palabras perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Solo por la bater√≠a pero excelentes la verdad. Aun as√≠ me dura lo suficiente la carga"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con su caja y cargador gen√©ricos, pero el equipo f√≠sicamente al 100, bater√≠a al 100, tiempo de entrega d√≠a siguiente, msi."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El dispositivo lleg√≥ como nuevo con una bater√≠a al 89%, solo pueden apreciarse algunos peque√±os rasgu√±os en la pantalla cerca de la c√°mara, sin embargo, fuera de ese detalle parece un tel√©fono nuevo, el cargador es gen√©rico y la verdad no me dio mucha confianza, prefer√≠ utilizar el que ya ten√≠a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone lleg√≥ bien, funciona bien, est√©tica 10/10 pero lleg√≥ con el 90% de bater√≠a :/"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy muy contento con la compra, el celular llego en excelentes condiciones, ya han pasado los d√≠as desde que lo compre y estoy 100% satisfecho. Debo decir que cuando me lleg√≥ , no estaba muy contento porque no ven√≠a en su caja original ni sus accesorios, ya que el abrir un iphone en su empaque tambi√©n es una experiencia genial. Fuera de eso sin problemas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad estuve dudosa en si me conven√≠a c√≥mpralo, pero qued√© gratamente sorprendido, no tiene ning√∫n detalle de est√©tica, el funcionamiento es perfecto, la bater√≠a viene al 100%Sin duda ha sido una compra muy buena.Adem√°s que cuentan con meses sin intereses y llego antes de lo que esperaba."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo dos semanas utiliz√°ndolo. Lleg√≥ en otro empaque pero eso es lo de menos, ya que hasta el momento ha funcionado de maravilla y hasta me lleg√≥ con la mica protectora de pantalla como extra, siendo que cuestan muy caras. Sin duda volver√≠a a comprar productos reacondicionados en Amazon. Totalmente una compra 100% ecol√≥gica. No me arrepiento de la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It works great but I‚Äôd say for the price... add a AirPod. Also I‚Äôm traveling internationally from Canada to Jamaica and would love to know if it‚Äôs unlocked for Jamaica"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Espero s√≥lo haya sido mala suerte. El iPhone estaba impecable incluso tra√≠a una mica para la pantalla y con 94% de condici√≥n. Lo configure y use por una semana. Hab√≠a tenido un poco de problema con la se√±al de Telcel pero se solucion√≥ s√≥lo (quien sabe c√≥mo). El problema fue que una semana despu√©s la pantalla se puso verde, despu√©s se quit√≥ y sent√≠ alivio, pero volvi√≥ a ponerse en verde y as√≠ estuvo iba y ven√≠a el verde. Me hab√≠a gustado mucho pero tuve que devolverlo. Afortunadamente pude borrar mis datos. Estoy en espera del reembolso. He comprado otros y nunca me hab√≠a pasado esto de la pantalla verde."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto ven√≠a sin detalles est√©ticos, funcionando de manera √≥ptima, incluyendo el face id y con pila del 89%. Sin embargo al actualizar a iOS 15 detect√≥ que la pantalla no era la original. Siendo est√° una pantalla que incluso no era OLED."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bien el Tel√©fono, su pila con 89% pero bien y cuidado para ser renovado sin problemas de funcionamiento u otras cosas lo recomiendo, el precio bien a meses y cobla confianza de que Amazon te responde"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Considero que si estuvo algo elevado el precio ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad era lo que esperaba, excedi√≥ mi expectativa ya que llego 2 dias antes de lo programado, me llamo la atenci√≥n que el celular ya venia hasta con protector de vidrio templado, claro que volver√≠a a comprar, sabiendo que son productos buenos y sobretodo garantizados , si te ahorras unos cuantos miles de pesos en Mexico respecto a su valor NUEVO."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone SE calienta mucho al usarlo y llega con una mica de vidrio, se la quite para ponerle una mica mate y cual fue mi sorpresa ‚ÄúLA PANTALLA RAYADA Y TALLADA‚Äù tiene muchos rayones y talones, le ponen la mica para disimular su estado. Estoy por devolverlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone didn't work right was told to return it and I did want a refund"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ con lo que indica, au qu√© la pantalla est√° muy rallada, cosa que se intent√≥ tapar con un protector de vidrio."

No incluye cargador ni caja original, pero por el costo y la promoci√≥n de MSI lo vale!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Completely worth the price!!.. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I‚Äôm üíØ happy with the phone.. Battery life at 95% and not a scratch on the unit.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Una verdadera lastima a la hora de abrir el paquete, siempre est√°s con la ilusi√≥n de estrenar un equipo ya sea nuevo o usado pero la ilusi√≥n se volvi√≥ frustraci√≥n al ver que solo ven√≠an instrucciones del equipo reacondicionado y un cargador generico, creo que es una falta grave de respeto hacer ese tipo de cosas y no los justifico de ning√∫n modo, lo √∫nico bueno de todo esto fue que si me hicieron el reembolso, 20 d√≠as despu√©s de la compra y yo sin celular y sin dinero por esos largos 20 d√≠as de angustia, espero y les sirva este comentario y a ustedes no les pase lo mismo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente relaci√≥n calidad precio"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular me llego con las c√°maras rayadas, pantalla rayada y lo peor con las bocinas tapadas con mugre, tanta mugre que no se escucha nada cuando hablo por tel√©fono. Esperaba m√°s de los est√°ndares de calidad de Amazon."

El iPhone tiene est√©tica de 10, llego con buen porcentaje de bater√≠a. Parece nuevo literal. Recomiendo al vendedor y el producto. Lo √∫nico que no me gusto fueron los cargadores ya que en el anuncio sal√≠a con los cargadores originales."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba nervoso porque se me hac√≠a un precio muy barato, adem√°s de leer rese√±as de que pod√≠an venir sin servir o rayados, pero a√∫n as√≠ decid√≠ tomar el riesgo. No pude haber tomado mejor decisi√≥n, est√° impecable. Ni un solo ray√≥n y su bater√≠a al 100%."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene como se indica, el iPhone en excelentes condiciones, con las especificaciones establecidas, la vida de la bater√≠a al 100. El cable y cargador es gen√©rico como se establece. Lo malo es que el cargador es de muy bajo amperaje y tarda una eternidad en cargar, creo al poner cargador gen√©rico podr√≠an incluir uno de carga r√°pida."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono ven√≠a en muy buenas condiciones, solo rayones min√∫sculos en la pantalla, el resto del tel√©fono estaba como nuevo. Ninguna pieza interna ha sido cambiada y su bater√≠a estaba al 95 %. Lo √∫nico malo es el cargador que incluye, es gen√©rico, no recomiendo que se use, ya que podr√≠a da√±ar la bater√≠a. Y ya tengo dos meses con √©l y funciona a la perfecci√≥n !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular est√° impecable, no tiene ning√∫n da√±o f√≠sico visible, lleg√≥ s√∫per r√°pido y hasta ahorita no ha tenido ninguna falla de ning√∫n tipo. La pila est√° al 92%Creo que vale mucho la pena estoy muy contenta con mi compra."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","el telefono llego en perfecto estado , impecable lo malo de comprar ese tipo de telefono es que no vienen equipados con la frecuencia de datos moviles de 28 , que es la necesaria para soportar compa√±ias de telefono como es bait , pillofon , la de megacable , etc , te limitas solo a telcel , att , unefon y esas de ese estilo , si ati no te interesan esas telefonias mas economicas , es una muy buena opcion"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad tuve terror de comprar un celular re acondicionado pero ya llevo dos semanas us√°ndolo y no he tenido el menor problema. El tel√©fono no ten√≠a ning√∫n detalle est√©tico ni funcional. Bater√≠a al 99% y no trae cables originales ni aud√≠fonos pero honestamente si por eso va a costar la mitad, no tengo ning√∫n problema. ¬°Excelente compra! Lo volver√≠a a hacer."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego de Estetica de 10 , pero la pantalla si estaba muy rallada le puse una mica de cristal y problema solucionado pero al mes me empez√≥ a fallar el Face ID y lo tuve que devolver , lo raro que al otro d√≠a ya lo estaban vendiendo otra vez porque lo ten√≠an como producto agotado , no se si sea coincidencia o les vali√≥ que fallaba y lo pusieron otra vez ala venta"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La bter√≠a lleg√≥ al 85%, despu√©s de 2 semanas baj√≥ a 84%. Ten√≠a dos marcas circulares en pantalla que se notaban a contra luz. Los orificios se ven sucios. Se calentaba mucho y se medio empa√±aba la mica de cristal. El rendimiento y funci√≥n fu√© correcto Pero no me agrad√≥ el calentamiento ni tantos detalles f√≠sicos. Afortunadamente esta la opci√≥n de devolver. Realmente esperaba mas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° como nuevo, funciona al 100%. Viene en un empaque gen√©rico con un cargador gen√©rico y un cable de carga gen√©rico, pero el tel√©fono es 100% original y viene muy bien protegido."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta bien el tel√©fono sin problemas, lo √∫nico malo son los accesorios"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo compr√© y el d√≠a que lo revise no serv√≠a bien la c√°mara y la bocina. Venia con varios rasgu√±os demasiado evidentes.Lleg√≥ en una caja como de huevo Jajaja deber√≠an tener una mejor presentaci√≥n para que no se da√±e m√°s el celular.Lo √∫nico bueno fue que Amazon me reembols√≥ el pago sin problema."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En lo personal no me agrado que en todo el marco tenga detalles, especialmente por que menciona que no se ver√°n a una mano de distancia, pero se ve. De m√°s. No se distingue tanto en foto pero en persona si. Creo que no pedir√≠a otro."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio dudaba de si comprar o no un tel√©fono reacondicionado pero finalmente me anim√© y la vdd es que no me arrepiento, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ en perfecto estado y a tiempo, solo tiene uno o dos peque√±os rasgu√±os en la pantalla pero en el d√≠a a d√≠a ni se notan, todo funciona perfecto, llevo unos d√≠as con el dispositivo y todo va excelente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me parecio una excelente compra"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","If I could give 0 stars I would. The ad said that it was a brand new phone but it wasn‚Äôt.

Currently looking into returning the phone. Not pleased at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto , me lleg√≥ con bater√≠a del %98La √∫nica queja ser√≠a con el cable y el cargador que tardaban mucho en cargar .Tra√≠a mica y ni un solo detalle de golpes o desgaste.Lo recomiendo altamente"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular llego golpeado, decid√≠ qued√°rmelo porque es un fuerte gasto y no tengo manera para comprobar que el celular hab√≠a llegado golpeado y no hab√≠a sido yo. Me di cuenta hasta que lo saque del empaque. Compre un celular similar en Walmart y todo fue excelente, decid√≠ darle la oportunidad al vendedor en Amazon, pero fallaron totalmente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esperaba un poco m√°s de est√©tica en el equipo, llega rayado y con golpes es entendible por el precio pero para ser honestos si ya le van a invertir en este equipo p√≥nganle un poco m√°s y compren uno nuevo, yo lo hubiera hecho."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se ve√≠a perfecto hasta que intent√© encenderlo. Not√© que el bot√≥n de encendido estaba medio sumido y tuve que presionarlo m√°s de lo normal para que respondiera. Este es una falla muy obvia. La verdad me decepcion√≥ que esta falla no haya sido detectada por Amazon como lo indican en la descripci√≥n de sus productos Reacondicionados donde aseguran que revisan antes los productos.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No lo recomiendo, equipo defectuoso. No funciona el altavoz desde que lo recib√≠."

"iPhone 11","The most important thing to me is the battery life and the way the phone works. It came with a 94% battery life, but there were a few more scratches than anticipated, but I will trade that off for better battery life."
"iPhone 11","Phone is clean and works well, i haven‚Äôt had any issues in the few weeks i‚Äôve had it. It came with a battery health of 90% meaning they didn‚Äôt put a new battery in so thats something to keep in mind."
"iPhone 11","Phone is in near perfect condition. Only complaint is the charging cube that came with the phone was cheap and got overheated as soon as the phone was plugged in (just leave it out). I really enjoy Apple as a brand because it is honestly just so easy once you are used to it, but I am not someone that needs the newest and just don't really care to pay for the newest. Amazon providing refurbished tech is great for the environment as well as for penny pinchers like me."
"iPhone 11","Purchased a refurbished red iPhone 11. Extremely happy with the phone. Everything works great. There was a small scratch on the screen, but not noticeable when phone is in use. Battery stays charged for hours."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs a nice phone came a day early but the battery health is only 79% I wish it was at least 85% battery heath also has a couple scratches under the screen protector but all in all it‚Äôs a good working phone I‚Äôd recommended buying. Came with a screen protector already on it too."
"iPhone 11","I wasn‚Äôt spending a fortune on an apple phone if I could help it. I upgraded after almost 4 years, I don‚Äôt upgrade unless I absolutely have to. I get used to my phone and don‚Äôt really want to learn another phone lol. This one is sufficient enough for everything I need. I love iPhone and refused to steer away from apple. Great purchase, would buy from this seller again."
"iPhone 11","I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and I‚Äôm very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they weren‚Äôt very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and I‚Äôll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so can‚Äôt say much else."
"iPhone 11","got it for my boyfriend, been about 4 months since he started using it and it‚Äôs been going very well so far! there were only a few very minor scratches on the back, not even noticeable. Battery health is expected for a used phone."
"iPhone 11","Brought this refurbished unlocked to use with a plan I purchased through Walmart (forget the name). This worked perfectly. The phone's camera is great (not like the latest pixel) but still worth the price along with the memory, etc."
"iPhone 11","It was good condition and that's what I got . A few dents on the top side of phone but not bad at all .. love the phone"
"iPhone 11","The product is exactly as described by seller. It had minor scratches but nothing really bad or bothering me. The battery life is better than I expected. I'm very satisfied and definitely would buy it again."
"iPhone 11","COMPRE EL TELEFONO POR LAS BUENAS REVIEW QUE VI Y NO ME EQUIVOQUE. TIENE ALGUNA QUE OTRA MARCA PERO FUNCIONA EXCELENTE. LA BATERIA ME VINO CAMBIADA Y ENTIENDO QUE ESTA AL 100% PERO NO ME FIGURA LA CONDICION. YO TUVE UNA BUENA EXPERIENCIA."
"iPhone 11","I bought a new phone for Christmas and I got this one and it work‚Äôs awesome I love it in every way! Also it came in the mail fast!! Thanks Amazon!!!"
"iPhone 11","The screen could of been better. It has alot scratches but still was managable"
"iPhone 11","Amazing!!! I got a yellow for myself and a black for my husband and they are flawless!!! Long battery life, not a single mark anywhere on either phone or screen, and they came with glass screen protectors on! Will definitely return to this seller when we are ready for the 13!"
"iPhone 11","Phones functioning are really good but you can see scratches on outer surfaces as they been pre owned. The charger they are providing here is not actual Apple charger. The one I received was from ZCOTU company."
"iPhone 11","I upgraded from an iPhone 6s as a birthday present to myself. I wasn‚Äôt willing to pay over $400, didn‚Äôt want to see visible wear & tear, needed the phone to be purple. And with this purchase???! BAYY-BEEüó£ got everything I asked for! I love my new phone and I‚Äôm so grateful to myself (and the company who I purchased from) for taking the time to find this gem üíé. This was a fast ship too, ordered on 11/15 got it 11/17. Do yourself a favor & take advantage of this deal üî•‚ÄºÔ∏è

"iPhone 11","Writing this review after having the phone for a few weeks. It‚Äôs awesome. I hate buying refurbished and renewed because I like the ‚Äúnew‚Äù feeling you get when buying something never before used (I know lol) but this is the next best. If you don‚Äôt have the money for an actual new one, I highly recommend this one"
"iPhone 11","Screen came slightly popped out from the phone and there was a minor dent on the side.Other than that there was no other problems, batters was at 91% and face id was working."
"iPhone 11","Almost perfect condition! 92% battery life! The only thing was a tiny scratch on the front that isn‚Äôt very visible in the first place and disappeared completely when I put on a screen protector. If you want to save yourself a couple hundred dollars I highly recommend buying one of these!"
"iPhone 11","There are so many scratches on the screens."
"iPhone 11","Very surprised with the refurbished iPhone 11. I figured there would be a few light scratches or scuffs but looks like it just came from the apple factory!"
"iPhone 11","Bang for your buck!!! Like new couldn‚Äôt complain one bit speaker loud camera looks great everything works perfect and was able to start my service on it."
"iPhone 11","Pretty good for now. Expected more for the ‚Äúexcellent condition‚Äù as the phone has a little scratch on the screen"
"iPhone 11","the phone is great! it came with a screen protector. the screen protector had minor scratches and so was some of the camera, but that was expected with a refurbished. i had a 7 plus so this is quite of an upgrade but i love it! it did NOT come with a sim card but did come with the thing to open it & a charger/box piece. it‚Äôs also unlocked so it was the easiest thing to set up. i love this phone, thank u cell surfers!"
"iPhone 11","I was hesitant to purchase a used phone, and it worked out very well. The iPhone looks perfect, and the yellow does not disappoint. This is my big move from Android to Apple, and it has been seamless. I am very impressed with what Amazon has delivered. Great job!"
"iPhone 11","Purchased as a replacement for a broken phone. If I didn‚Äôt know it was previously owned I would have thought it was brand new. Great value for the money."
"iPhone 11","Besides the few nicks which don't affect it at all, my iPhone 11 is in top shape. Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay but the facial recognition is where it is at. Amazing detail for the retina display and tons of useful features and apps. It was really easy to set up. the generic cable and power brick both work great. Though the cable is a little on the short side. But since I previously had an iPhone SE, I happen to still have longer cables. And now I can make full use of my home pod mini. The price is well worth it with how slight the damage was. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a case. But I am sure to get one soon. Bluetooth on this device is amazing reaching every corner of where I live without caring around the device. I just wanted to test it out. The best feature is the battery which charges in about half an hour. And lasts all day. That is with a heavy battery use live wallpaper. I switched from Android and don't miss it."
"iPhone 11","Bought this phone for my 17-year-old son. He asked for a brand-new phone, and I laughed. He loses just about everything. Getting this phone was a compromise and he had the advantage because the phone is perfect. No scratches on screen or back and battery is between 90-98%. I've heard buying reconditioned phones is a risky venture. Not in this case. It was everything they promised and more."
"iPhone 11","Screen did have damage upon opening. I am assuming it was damaged somehow in transit because it was a great product other than the screen damage."
"iPhone 11","I was skeptical, but from reading All of the reviews I decided to take a chance. I‚Äôm glad I did. Everything works perfect. No scratches whatsoever."
"iPhone 11","The phone was great and a huge save towards my bank account. Battery came at 100% everything looks and works perfect! Would recommend this seller"
"iPhone 11","I bought this used phone. It was in perfect condition and it came with a charger. My son is very happy with his new phone."
"iPhone 11","It works fine, but the problem is the speaker which it wasn‚Äôt loud enough. For the rest of this iPhone, it works fine."
"iPhone 11","Face ID works well ,only complaint is the battery life was 84% when delivered and the back screen light dims from time to time but it‚Äôs a good phone ! Came with charger and screen protector!"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in excellent working condition. Seller is reliable and responsive. Would recommend purchasing a refurbished phone from this seller before paying full price for something new. Great deal on the iPhone 11 in like-new condition!"
"iPhone 11","i like the phone its like a brand new phone witch was fantastic i found close to no scratches or scuff marks whatsoever. but only my phone battery capacity was 78% but i can just buy a Certified iphone battery online for like 20-30 dollars and replace it :D. 9/10 i would show pictures but my computer dosent have a camera. but i 100% recommend buying this product."
"iPhone 11","Phone works great. I‚Äôd buy buy a refurbished phone again. This one does respond to touch slowly on occasion."
"iPhone 11","This was my first phone I purchased without any parent money and let me tell it was worth it I still have it is unlocked. I still use it i recently just used it in Korea it still works great I had it for almost a year now"
"iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about purchasing a phone through Amazon but I took a risk and it was worth it. The phone itself was clean, not scratched, and looks completely new. Wasn‚Äôt disappointed and would definitely buy from this company again in the future."
"iPhone 11","elular me lleg√≥ perfecto sin rayones, limpio entre otras cosas muy bueno, pero en el momento en el q reviso la bater√≠a, esta se encuentra en 78% y se supone q pague por uno q deber√≠a venir 90% a 100%, esta fue mi √∫nica molestia"
"iPhone 11","The telephone works prefect. I did come with small scratches that you can see from further than 12 inches on the top right hand side of the screen, but it seemed to not matter since it is refurbished. What matters is that everything about the telephone works."
"iPhone 11","The phone is good and easy to work I just wish the battery life was better"
"iPhone 11","I personally think this is a alright reasonable deal. But there will be some ups and down's. One of the ups was that the phone was at, 83 percent battery capacity, also had a great working screen, honestly everything worked well, until I played some music to test the audio. I was flabbergasted, because of how distorted the audio sounded like, because of this I was pretty disappointed, because I am a person that loves music. But if you're a person that's willing to take risk's, buy it, but other than that I am upset, and furious because if you want to return this item you have to go to a ""UPS"" store and additionally pay some money to return it, I am very disappointed be careful, but other than that I am waiting for my money to be refunded back to my bank account, but if you are sure you need a refurbished phone, know that there are risks that come with the phone, which may make the phone nonworking."
"iPhone 11","Great phone did have trouble getting it to download to iOS 16.1 but overall it is a great phone and was packaged as safe as possible"
"iPhone 11","Loved how quickly it came in. Works like its brand new and didnt have to spend an arm and leg."
"iPhone 11","Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone can‚Äôt expect perfect condition that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone can‚Äôt really see but since I applied a screen protector can‚Äôt see it at all üòÅ. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also can‚Äôt see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but let‚Äôs see how that goes . I‚Äôm not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and it‚Äôs working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyone‚Äôs experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it ."
"iPhone 11","UNLOCKED 100% Perfect condition not a problem so far , Fast shipping great price thanks a lot"
"iPhone 11","Having a problem with the volume. When the phone rings or when I'm talking on the phone, the volume goes down. I checked the side for volume control and it's all up.
Is there anything else I can do? Is there a malfunction?"
"iPhone 11","This is my everyday phone now. I love it. However I did switch from android to iPhone and I have no complaints so far. Good phone works amazing even if your on the phone all imlay it doesn‚Äôt drain that fast"
"iPhone 11","Thank you I got the iPhone 11 today nice so far is very good phone I got red one I like itüëçWork very good brand-new"
"iPhone 11","I was nervous ordering this phone but I really needed it and it came fast and so far so good the phone had no scratches screen is beautiful no cracks came with the screen saver I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase THANK YOU"
"iPhone 11","phone had a little glitch when i frist recieved it. i just figured maybe i just was seeing things so i continued on. bout two months in same glitch but lasted a minute or so in the top corner. so i figured i better send it back.

"iPhone 11","Delivery was fast and on time. Phone worked really well"
"iPhone 11","Todo muy bien pero la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a estaba baja"
"iPhone 11","It came in perfect conditions and it works properly"
"iPhone 11","Ordered the iPhone 11. Product arrived in good physical condition. The battery would not stay charged. Once got to 78% would shut down and go to less than 10% battery life. Tried factory reset... everything to keep phone. Returned phone, was well packed in bubble wrap, box and padded envelope. Seller said was returned with a cracked camera housing and kept 30% of our $$$. There were no cracks on the phone when we returned it. This business kept our $$ and we have no recourse. Beware... would not purchase from this seller again.

**Update** Seller reached out and did refund the 'restocking' fee due to our rebuttle about the 'damaged' phone.
.. and to make us a satisfied customer. We support small business and encourage others to as well. This small business did the right thing. Would trust them with another purchase."
"iPhone 11","really good phone and it came like brand new worth it"
"iPhone 11","Good quality refurbished phone!"
"iPhone 11","I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone."
"iPhone 11","I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasn‚Äôt happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I don‚Äôt feel the need just yet because battery is really great. Overall I‚Äôm glad I got this because I really needed to upgrade my iPhone 8."
"iPhone 11","El telefono es para mi hija, hasta ahora funciona bien. La bateria no esta al 100% y el protector de pantalla vino roto. hare el reclamo correspondiente."
"iPhone 11","Everything fine except the fact that the phone battery life is lower than my iPhone 6 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠üòí"
"iPhone 11","I got this phone, well it wasn‚Äôt too long ago but it works like new and nobody noticed it‚Äôs renewed"
"iPhone 11","Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay. Battery life is ok but not great. The phone is in great condition and is perfect for kids who tend to be less careful with the device."
"iPhone 11","Fantastic, unlocked phone. Was able to transfer all my data from my old Iphone 7 over with no problems."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in good condition and works fine.But when you are setting it up i recommend setting it up manually,the quick start can freeze the phone and you would have to reset it.Other than that it‚Äôs a great phone and when buying keep in mind it does not come with the SIM card.Super good!"
"iPhone 11","Good product."
"iPhone 11","Phone works great and battery is at 100%! Great buy."
"iPhone 11","Works so good and I took this with my old phone which is why the pics arnt that good"
"iPhone 11","Great option for a cheaper iPhone! Battery life is at 87% and the phone looks brand new. $300 for an iPhone 11 is not bad if you can buy at the right time"
"iPhone 11","Just like it was listed. Good battery life. Good phone."
"iPhone 11","Delivery was fast and i received the phone as expected . It is really in excellent condition and received it with battery at 85%. Been using it for some days it works great! Shipment was received inside a bubbled envelope but the phone was inside a plastic box, so safe. I would reccomend this seller."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve been using for a while now. I love the phone greatly. The camera is great and I haven‚Äôt received any problems with the phone so far. I love that this phone is 128 gb because my old phone would always run out of storage so fast."
"iPhone 11","Was definitely an upgrade."
"iPhone 11","This is my 3rd renewed iPhone. The 2 prior phones didn‚Äôt have any scratches at all. This iPhone was described as excellent and did have scratches and chips around the camera lens. The battery is also only at 81%. The battery on my older 8 plus trade in was at 83%.
All things considered I took a star off. Its in very good condition not excellent. More importantly the phone is 100% in good working order."
"iPhone 11","Bought an IPhone 11 for my Daughter that was Delivered really fast looks brand new, very Happy with purchase. Thank you"

"iPhone 11","Ped√≠ 2 iPhone 11 para mis hijos, ambos en blanco en estado ""excelente"". Uno realmente estaba en estado excelente, pr√°cticamente sin marcas de uso y con bater√≠a al 100%. El otro vino con marcas visibles, en pantalla y en los marcos, m√°s bater√≠a al 83%, la verdad esperaba m√°s, ambos funcionan bien, pero creo que el 2do iPhone estaba m√°s para entrar en estado ""muy bueno"", no en excelente. No s√© bien cu√°l ser√° el l√≠mite para calificarlo aqu√≠ o all√°... Me desilucion√≥ un poco."
"iPhone 11","Came with scratches and chips on the outer surface. Still worked good. I just put a phone cover on it and it looked brand new, but for the money expected the outside to be in better condition."

"iPhone 11","Battery life is 82%"
"iPhone 11","I had a few choices when I was shopping for a new phone. There were a several resellers who offered Renewed iPhones on Amazon. I'm glad that I checked their reviews as some had very low ratings and from what I could see they were selling sub-par phones. One I got from MobileSpree is EXCELLENT! 98% battery life, no scratches on display or the back, everything works wonderfully! I'm super satisfied with the purchase!"
"iPhone 11","Ten√≠a peque√±os ara√±azos en la pantalla pero funciona bien"

"iPhone 11","Everything good great condition the only problem is that the battery health was at 85% when I got it and that isn‚Äôt good sure it‚Äôs a renewal but whoever used it before had it for a good couple months."
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived a day earlier than expected and is in great shape physically. No scratches or defects. Battery health was 83% upon arrival so it meets the claim of at least 80%. No issues with setup, inserting the SIM card, or updating the OS. So far I am very satisfied with this purchase."

"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono est√° muy bien"
"iPhone 11","Entrega inmediata y el producto todo ok"
"iPhone 11","Easy of setting up and it is a very functional and easy for for my son to use."
"iPhone 11","Unable to reset without previous owner's Apple credentials (i.e. - Activation lock is active) and all his data, including photos/videos/contacts/apps, is accessible since no passcode is set! Crazy, to say the least. Was supposed to be a birthday gift, so pretty disappointed Amazon. Please make this right ASAP.

***Update*** Amazon customer service (call) sent a replacement in decent cosmetic condition, but one of the speakerphone/stereo speakers is producing no sound and the other sounds blown, with distortion during high-volume playback of relatively quiet videos. After contacting Amazon customer support, I was taken through a long series of troubleshooting efforts with an Apple technician, only to conclude what was readily apparent; the speakers were faulty. I've been waiting two weeks for the ""escalation team"" to call me and losing confidence quickly. Not a good experience at all. I plan to return the phone and probably will avoid ""Amazon Refurbished"" altogether, in the future. They clearly have a poor QC process in place."
"iPhone 11","The Battery life could be better but other that that it‚Äôs perfect."
"iPhone 11","I like this upgrade from a 6s plus. It has performed well. Only thing i can gripe about was a couldn‚Äôt hear well with phone calls but the ear phone area was dirty. No problem now."
"iPhone 11","Dirty and the speaker kinda disgusting but fully working and operational for a refurbished iphone you cant get much better"
"iPhone 11","Product was just as described"
"iPhone 11","I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!"
"iPhone 11","Renewed iPhone 11 came flawless but had a 3‚Äù gray imprint on the white blank screen. Then after hrs of downloading so you can try it out. The speaker sounded terrible like down in a tunnel! The battery got Really hot in 10 mins of use. Couldn‚Äôt hold in your hand? So screen damage, speaker messed up and battery trouble‚Ä¶ But phone was flawlessü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My second Oder. Trying diff companies hoping for the real deal. Prob best to pay more and go to apple store for renewed phones. At least I got my money back"
"iPhone 11","Like new!! Very pleased"
"iPhone 11","I was so very nervous to buy this phone online but after reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and I can say that I'm pleased. There is a small scratch at the bottom of the phone since it is renewed but I'm still glad I made the purchase!

The phone came in a regular box with a charger (Acellories brand), and the little pin to open the sim card port. It also came with a customer support card, and a amazon renewed thank you card.

I was cautiously optimistic but overall I'm pleased! If I have any issues with this phone, I'll update my review."
"iPhone 11","minor scratches but works perfectly! the battery health was at 90%."
"iPhone 11","Love this phone it pretty much looked new"
"iPhone 11","I have no complaints with this phone. It works like a dream. Battery life is good."
"iPhone 11","Was really good"
"iPhone 11","No flaws on exterior, all features work, unlocked works. The battery only had 75% lifespan, which is acceptable for the price point. Thanks!"
"iPhone 11","It was an excellent product! More that I expected"
"iPhone 11","Don‚Äôt know yet"
"iPhone 11","This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly! Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also. I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!"
"iPhone 11","This is the second time I made a purchase with Avant. The iPhone 11 I purchased is Basically a brand new phone. The battery life is OK at 81% and that‚Äôs OK with me. The overall look and performance of the phone is truly outstanding. I plan to buy more phones with this company and I highly recommend it."
"iPhone 11","Really pleased with this iPhone. It is in excellent condition and I am enjoying it very much. This is my first iPhone, so it took me awhile to get it set up like I want. I would definitely buy again."
"iPhone 11","The product has good security features and the face recognition is super easy"
"iPhone 11","Its sooooooooo pretty I can't even complain. Looks brand new"
"iPhone 11","Great phone, reasonable price. Everything works!"
"iPhone 11","So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and it‚Äôs now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition that‚Äôs the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. They‚Äôre great."
"iPhone 11","The phone seems good so far but I paid for excellent condition and there‚Äôs a decent size scuff on the screen and the batter health is at 80%? I wouldn‚Äôt have got excellent condition if I knew it‚Äôd be like this but a phone is a phone"
"iPhone 11","Really nice phone. No scratches or problems. I‚Äôm happy with the purchase"
"iPhone 11","Liked everything I received it was brand new and nothing wrong with for being a used phone and way better than my old phone lol."
"iPhone 11","Si est√° funcionando correctamente"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","I was a bit hesitant to buy a phone from here, but it actually works great. The quality and battery life are amazing. Nothing wrong with the phone so far. I'm definitely glad I bought this phone. Much better than my last phone."
"iPhone 11","The face recognition doesn‚Äôt always work accurately that‚Äôs about it for the most part"
"iPhone 11","Everything"
"iPhone 11","I would like to say this is a perfect phone, and it certainly did work perfectly‚Ä¶ until exactly 6 months after my purchase, and I mean 6 months TO THE DAY. When it suddenly stopped working, wouldn‚Äôt charge, began turning on and off repetitively about every 2-5 minutes, and it kept saying something along the lines of ‚Äúbattery cannot be confirmed as an apple product‚Äù. So whatever battery is in my phone well .. idk wtf it is :|. Along with that when I brought it to Best Buy‚Äôs geek squad it was so far gone that the supervisor couldn‚Äôt really do much and since for some reason they seem to have thrown random parts together and made it somehow work for half a year, it also means that (at least at best buy through their connection with apple) they couldn‚Äôt find my phone/serial number in the system at all which meant I couldn‚Äôt even get a replacement which would‚Äôve been fricken covered but now I have to go to apple directly and am going to have to pay for a replacement battery and gods know what else. :|Update: I finally had my appt with apple and I thought it would maybe cost $150 max to replace the battery, ended up having to spend another $450 to just get an entirely new replacement phone instead. The battery still wouldn‚Äôt charge, and they said the wireless charger was so far gone and it was messed up somehow and that was what was causing the issue. I‚Äôm very suspicious though about how it all went down because I seriously mean it when I say it stopped working exactly 6 months after I bought it to the day üò≠"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 So I bought the phone in excellent condition. I am dissapointed that the phone came with scratches on the screen .. this was discovered only because I removed the screen protector. It had a micro crack on the back glass and a noticeable dent on the top left. I wasn't expecting that because I bought the phone in excellent condition . Other than that the phone is working fine"

"iPhone 11","Good"
"iPhone 11","I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasn‚Äôt expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand."
"iPhone 11","Came packaged well, my daughter loves it. Seems to be working well."
"iPhone 11","In the features and details it was noted that the battery health would be a minimum of 80% but the battery health health came 77% not satisfied at all with this. However, The housing etc is great."
"iPhone 11","This being my first IPhone after 4 androids. Basically very happy with the performance of the processor and functions. Battery level rated at 80%, so that barely qualifies with the seller‚Äôs specs.
My only real issue is the screen is not an Apple replacement and the brightness is a problem.
All in all, I‚Äôm happy with it."
"iPhone 11","I received my phone in GREAT cosmetic condition and it works very well. Battery is also holding nicely - after over a month of using it! Great price, great product = very happy!"
"iPhone 11","I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it‚Äôs hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it‚Äôs unlocked in packaging and on here‚Ä¶ I began the activation process ‚Ä¶ and it wouldn‚Äôt not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It‚Äôs disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can‚Äôt even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It‚Äôs just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt want to even purchase phones from here anymore ! I‚Äôm really disappointed ü•∫."
"iPhone 11","Got exactly what I wanted. Easy to activate. No hardware or software problems. So happy I made this choice."
"iPhone 11","UPDATE: customer service way better than Amazon. New phone doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues and they actually sent a charger.

This phone was supposed to be renewed in excellent condition and they didn‚Äôt even clean it. Worst there are scratches in the screen and back of the phone. Also, these phones are supposed to come with a charger and sim ejection tool. I just got the cord"
"iPhone 11","Love the new phone"
"iPhone 11","After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!"
"iPhone 11","everything looks good except the screen has some scuffs on it and the back camera is scratched. I bought 4 of these phone and 3/4 were perfect"
"iPhone 11","Todo est√° muy bien, pero la bater√≠a est√° un poco desgastada"
"iPhone 11","Unboxed, synced and everything seems to be working perfectly. Battery life is 84%. Beautiful phone with no immediate notice of exterior flaws. Perfectly boxed with charger, sim card remover, even included an inexpensive clear silicone cover until you could get a new one if desired and a tempered glass screen protector. The screen protector is cracked but wasn't expecting it so not disappointed. So far could not be more pleased."
"iPhone 11","She loves it, it is an upgrade for her and she is so excited. No problems noted!"
"iPhone 11","Es impresionante que el producto pareciera totalmente nuevo, ni un solo rasgu√±o, excelente calidad, y buen precio, quiz√° tuvimos suerte pero el producto es excelente,
El color le encant√≥ a mi mam√°, y el celular viene totalmente al 100%. Super√≥ mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11","The one came in and it worked so that was good off the bat. There were a few scratches on the back and around the outside of the camera. The only thing I was disappointed in is the battery life is 81%, I know they are renewed but that definitely could be better"
"iPhone 11","It has been a good phone!"
"iPhone 11","Good price for the phone. Just wish it had less scraches and better battery life"
"iPhone 11","So far this has exceeded my expectations. The phone seems brand new. It had a screen protector. Few minor scuffs on the corners, that‚Äôs not even noticeable. It was easy to set up. Process went as it should. Cameras both work. Battery seems to be pretty stable so far. I will update if anything changes but it came as described and works as it should."
"iPhone 11","Good condition"
"iPhone 11","Phone works perfectly and good price"
"iPhone 11","We bought the excellent condition one. It didn‚Äôt come for a while but I found it today. It had a scratch on the phones body. It was clearly visible from 12 inches away. It looks like it was hit against something. Everything works tho so we won‚Äôt be returning it."
"iPhone 11","Phone showed up packaged nicely, battery was charged and all I had to do is drop my SIM card in and allow it to update. All my apps transferred seamlessly."
"iPhone 11","I got it a couple days ago and so far I‚Äôve had no issues. It has a few dings but other than that seems to work great. Good buy üëçüèª"
"iPhone 11","This was a great buy, it was like a new brand phone, no dings, no scratch and no dents ."
"iPhone 11","El celular venia funcionando bien. Solo con alguno golpes externos pero por lo dem√°s al momento esta funcionando bien."
"iPhone 11","Everything seems like new except the 81% battery life. After a month, I can barely find any problems with it. However, the charger stopped working today."
"iPhone 11","I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. I have loved it and I thought it was the best purchase. However, yesterday my phone randomly crashed and it was at 50%. I turned it on and it was completely dead, but it was on. It said 0% remaining when I plugged it in and it was not seeming to charge. I went on settings and it told me that the battery in the phone is likely not compatible with this phone or it is not an actual apple battery. Now it can't go 2 minutes without crashing. I cannot even write this review on my phone because it will crash so I am using a computer. I would return the phone, but I cannot keep it on long enough to transfer my information to a new phone or to reset it. I am very disappointed and I do not know what to do. I would recommend buying straight from apple to ensure the phones reliability. Edit: I took it into best buy and I was told that the battery is not the issue, it failed all the tests and they did not replace it. I am not sure what the problem is. Maybe I just got a defective phone with my luck. I'm sure the other phones from this seller are reliable, I just had a bad experience. The customer service was great and they seemed very willing to help me out and assist in returns."
"iPhone 11","Nice phone, arrived without any scars and the seller put tempered glass on the screen. I have been using it for a few weeks and it works great. Unfortunately I don't hit the lottery. Mine arrived with 85% battery. Well, that's to be expected for the price, but you know what, it lasts!!! 5 stars!!!!!"
"iPhone 11","So I got this phone because I fell and shattered my old one, it arrived very quickly which was fantasy except I left for a trip the day before it arrived and therefor was not able to fully receive my package till I returned. Upon opening the package the box looked fine but the top R and bottom L corners of the phone have small cracks and the screen sits a little raised above the rest of the phone. Tried to process an exchange but would only give me the option to return but I can‚Äôt be without a phone sooooooo idk"
"iPhone 11","Battery a real plus, nice camera, screen. Easy to adapt to Apple phone from Android. Great to get a refurbished that was essentially a new phone. Review after two months' use. Added fast charger is worth the cost."
"iPhone 11","Excelente tel√©fono, cambie del 6s Plus al 11 y es un salto cuya diferencia se nota bastante en cuanto a optimizaci√≥n, fluidez y experiencia de usuario. Estaba esc√©ptico de comprar este tel√©fono por internet dados algunos reviews pero al final compr√© el iPhone 11 de 64 gb (unlocked) de BuySPRY y me lleg√≥ justo como lo ped√≠. Aunque el tel√©fono tiene algunos rayones en la pantalla no me quejo, funciona a la perfecci√≥n."
"iPhone 11","Battery life at 94% on arrival."
"iPhone 11","It was worthy! Love it"
"iPhone 11","The battery is significantly Degraded. Never with refurbished phones have I had this issue"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","The phone is fine. The problem is the charger I received is faulty. It crackles when I plug it in and won‚Äôt charge the phone."
"iPhone 11","Looks good minimal scratches. Battery capacity at 88%. I just got it so we will see how it works. So far so good, the only reason I did 4 stars is due to the battery capacity."
"iPhone 11","everything good especially camera"
"iPhone 11","I have been team android since I can remember. I decided to try something new! Let me just say I love my iPhone. It‚Äôs perfect no marks or anything. It even came on day early. Everything works completely fine. This phone is def like new! Make the purchase!"
"iPhone 11","My daughter jumped on the Apple bandwagon. She's never owned an iPhone before, always Android. She loves the iPhone, says it's the best phone she's ever had."
"iPhone 11","Got this for my dad he loves it only uses it for talk text and YouTube , overall a great affordable option for older parents who are not that text savvy"
"iPhone 11","I bought this for my girlfriend and she still using it until I upgrade it to a iPhone 12 and she loves it"
"iPhone 11","The battery life and poor charger"
"iPhone 11","I tried several Trinidad and Tobago Sims and they did not work so I had to return. Otherwise phone was in good condition save for a few scratches on the screen"
"iPhone 11","Love the color and very clean look. Battery was a little lower than I‚Äôd usually like but nonissues with the phone so far"
"iPhone 11","the phone works good overall. it‚Äôs just hard to hear talking on the phone without it on speaker. the camera isn‚Äôt as good as my boyfriends brand new Iphone 11."
"iPhone 11","I'm beginning to experience a few details with my phone. The battery seems chargeable up to 86%. Oh, and when I call and the call goes to voicemail my screen goes black, it freezes until the call hangs me up. I discovered that if I tap it I can unfreeze it."
"iPhone 11","Todo ok, la bater√≠a solo vino baja"
"iPhone 11","what took so long was for it to update"
"iPhone 11","Las bocinas del cel para llamada se escuchan bajitas pero est√°n bien para mi no me gustan los altos sonidos"
"iPhone 11","I was afraid to see negative comments but my phone arrived in perfect condition"
"iPhone 11","This pack was amazing. I love the iPhone and it was in excellent condition no scratches. Loved the purple color. Overall a great buy!"
"iPhone 11","Bought this phone in august and it has been working perfectly since the day I got it!!! Perfect condition, nearly perfect battery, and fast"
"iPhone 11","Nothing wrong with the product came earlier than expected very satisfied with this üòÅ"
"iPhone 11","My son cracked his iPhone and I went to Best Buy to have it fixed but they said it would cost $400 to replace the whole phone. I got a better deal from this vendor and it even includes a charger! Would buy again."
"iPhone 11","My daughter wanted an upgrade from her iPhone 8 Plus. So I got her this red iPhone 11 on here. So far, so good. Phone was in excellent condition!"
"iPhone 11","Service delivery was great and the time the phone arrived was earlier than expected...the phone works well n is in a good condition... Had some scratches but with a case it's perfect"
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono en perfecto estado tal cual lo describ√≠a. No eh tenido ning√∫n problema. Lo estoy usando en Argentina y nada de inconvenientes"
"iPhone 11","The phone works greats. The physical blemishes are barely noticeable. I am debating whether or not to send it back because the listening speaker at the top of the phone is defective. The volume is super low and I can barely hear who is talking to me even when I have the volume at the max. I barely use this speaker when I make calls, I mostly put people on speaker phone or use headphones. So I‚Äôm deciding if I want the minor inconvenience of ordering a new one. Other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 11","Totally pleased with my new phone !"
"iPhone 11","I bought this refurbished at an excellent price. It looks brand new. The only problem is that the speaker for your ear was hard to hear. Now it doesn't work at all. I use earbuds most of the time so it isn't a problem. Beautiful color too üòç"
"iPhone 11","Not bad"
"iPhone 11","Its a good phone but at like 78% battery life"
"iPhone 11","Ten√≠as rayones y eso no lo dec√≠a en la descripci√≥n"
"iPhone 11","Excellent condition"
"iPhone 11","Gifted to someone"
"iPhone 11","Bought this phone a couple months ago at most thinking it would be good. It‚Äôs already having problems with Face ID and actual screen. Hasn‚Äôt been dropped on ground or water and is acting like this. I have more than enough storage so it should be running smoothly but in reality it doesn‚Äôt. Swiping gets so slow at times and I can‚Äôt figure out why. This is my second phone like this, and I would recommend getting a new one"
"iPhone 11","Would like to get a renewed phone that has at least 90% battery health. In my opinion, it should have a newbattery replacement."
"iPhone 11","As expected just wish the battery % was higher that 82. An overall good buy."
"iPhone 11","I ordered excellent condition. But there are lot of visible scratches."
"iPhone 11","The phone shipped very fast and came in good packaging. The phone is in good condition, no visible scratches or cracks. The battery is at maximum capacity 90%, still lasts awhile. I would say it‚Äôs well worth it."
"iPhone 11","Aside from a little tiny dent and the battery life being 82% at max capacity I think it‚Äôs pretty good! The charger that came with the phone is a little underwhelming tho."
"iPhone 11","This phone is great! I switched from Samsung so it took a minute to acclimate to Apple but I love how simple it is. Everything works and looks like new.I‚Äôve had this phone for months and there have been no problems."
"iPhone 11","My battery life came at 93 percent. It is better than the other refurbished phones I have had. No scratch on the surface at all. Perfect phone. Got the red t mobile version."
"iPhone 11","Just as new. Works like a charm!! Highly recommended with a case."
"iPhone 11","I liked that it came with everything and was in working condition"
"iPhone 11","Phone is in perfect condition! Battery life is at 100!!!"
"iPhone 11","i like this phone it‚Äôs basically as good as new there was a few nicks and scratches on the phone and air bubbles on the screen but it doesn‚Äôt really brother me to be honest everything else about the phone is good."
"iPhone 11","Does have a bunch of dings on it almost too close to the screen. Would think lesser dings. Will update later how the performance is it‚Äôs a birthday gift so I can‚Äôt review just yet. Nice packaging."
"iPhone 11","Lo que m√°s me gust√≥ es el excelente estado en el que vino, sin da√±os. El √∫nico aspecto es que la bater√≠a arrib√≥ en 84% lo cual se dice que est√° en los par√°metros normales para cuando lo recib√≠ y que la pantalla no puede verificarse."
"iPhone 11","Overall the phone is in good condition, came with 86% battery healthThe only problem I seem to have is with the speakers that are muffled"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 This is definitely worth the price, I bought this because I needed an iPhone for personal reasons and this is a complete steal! I think that for anyone who needs an iPhone is definitely going to get their bang for their buck. Already recommended this to others who were surprised by the price and more who thought it was fake and a rip offüòí"

"iPhone 11","Phone arrived dead- no big deal but has multiple scratches on the screen which I was Not anticipating and not very pleased with."
"iPhone 11","Was a Little skeptical since I‚Äôve never ordered a used phone before! Everything is in perfect condition! I got this phone for my daughter it is her first phone ! She is in love with it! We realize it‚Äôs a hassle to sign up with local carriers and be on a contract , we prefer to buy a sim and a pre paid everything worked out and had no issues !! Battery life is a little low but don‚Äôt have to recharge at all through the day!"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. My biggest concern was that the phone would not be trully unlocked but it actually was so I could use it right away by inserting my SIM card. It looks great, not a single scratch, basically new."
"iPhone 11","The phone is overall great, smooth and what I expected from a renewed phone but the charging port seems to be faulty it doesn‚Äôt charge properly as I will have to play with it before getting it to charge and pray it stays charging. Which I feel is a major issue."
"iPhone 11","The phone came perfectly packaged‚Ä¶ it was compatible with boost mobile.. i just cant hear when i put my phone up to my ear to talk. Its like the speaker is water damaged"
"iPhone 11","Battery life was just 86% :("
"iPhone 11","The product was in amazing cosmetic condition, little to no visible scratches on the body. It looks and works like new. I would‚Äôve given it five stars except it came carrier locked and I had to go about unlocking it myself. The seller was quite helpful and offered to replace the device. Overall it was a worthwhile purchase."
"iPhone 11","Buying renewed phones can be scary I was hesitant to buy but so far it‚Äôs working great and the seller went ahead and also put a screen protector on whic is perfectly installed no cracks or dents in phone the only thing I‚Äôm kinda unhappy with is that the battery health is at 85% would like to see it at 90 but hey‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11","It had a scratch on the side of the front face camera other than that it was good"
"iPhone 11","The phone is in excellent condition - no detectable wear. Good packaging, that included charger and cable, screen protectors, and a SIM card tool. Fast shipping. Highly recommend this seller."
"iPhone 11","I am very satisfied, it won me over"
"iPhone 11","Minor Scratches ,I paid for ‚Äúexcellent condition ‚Äú but it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm really I love with the phone major upgrade from iphone8. Happy with my purchase !!"
"iPhone 11","I was super skeptical because it is renewed but you would never know works just like a brand new phone I love it"
"iPhone 11","Little scratch at the bottom. Battery life not bad. Slow internet sometimes. It worth the price though."
"iPhone 11","Bought an ""excellent condition"" phone, one speaker doesn't work and there is a chip on the screen. 84% battery life which it does state that this tier has 80%+ so I guess that's to be expected. Just highly disappointed about the speaker and the indent on the screen. Besides those two issues, everything else seems to fine so far."
"iPhone 11","Had issues with sound and eventually returned. Seller was understanding and communication was good."
"iPhone 11","It was a great purchase, the product is fully functional and battery health is around 95%."
"iPhone 11","The phone came veey fast, which i liked. Battery goes down very quick."
"iPhone 11","The phone came with no scratches but the battery health is only 78%. I wanted at least an 85% battery health"
"iPhone 11","Very good case for my phone"
"iPhone 11","Phone seems brand new the only problem I have with it is that it didn‚Äôt come with the color I ordered also the phone isn‚Äôt up to date when received and the battery life is very low"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in perfect condition -- the battery life was at 100% and no scratches anywhere. The call quality was as expected on both speaker phone and using the handset. It went through a full day's use and the battery only dropped to about 55%. Great seller experience with KANGA SUPPLY."
"iPhone 11","Phone works well, I was skeptical buying refurbished, very thankful it works!"
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono llego en excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11","I like the phone it's great"
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived on time and I was very nervous to see what was inside because I had bought an IPhone 11 from ‚ÄúBuySPRY‚Äù (that phone came with screen issues, scratches just an awful experience from that seller).

However I got the phone returned that decided to use ‚ÄúKANGA SUPPLY‚Äù instead. The phone was in perfect condition. It did not have any sign of previous use or any scratches. The battery life was at 88% which is ok for me.

It didn‚Äôt came with the original box or the original accessories but came with a generic charger.

Overall I was very pleased with the phone and I would highly recommend them."
"iPhone 11","Good as expected. Battery came with 85% of life condition. Very minimum scratches"
"iPhone 11","I love it and I‚Äôm literally writing my review using the phone I bought"
"iPhone 11","el disposito funciona bien en panama completamente desbloqueado, 87% de vida util de la bateria. excelente."
"iPhone 11","After about 1 month of use my screen just blacked out. I took that to the chin and took it upon myself to pay to get it replaced (literally on my birthday too). A couple of months later the battery just started acting up. If the phone processes too many apps then it'll force shut down and turn back on at 10%. It'll do this repeatedly too jumping from 10 to 50% it's ridiculous."
"iPhone 11","I am a 75 year old Grandmother that had a flight scheduled to see my grandchildren. Less than a week before my flight my phone decided to stop working. In a panic I contacted my daughter for help. She did research and suggested I buy a refurbished iPhone from Amazon. When ordering the phone I realized it could be shipped to arrive after my flight left. I emailed the customer service at Techlobby and explained my problem to them. Unbelievably I received a personal call from Morris at Techlobby and he gave me his personal promise that the phone had been tested and was in excellent working order and that he would see that it was shipped by 2nd Day Air so I could receive it the day before my flight. Morris did exactly as he promised and I had my terrific new phone before I flew to Texas.
Techlobby and Morris provided A+ customer service. I was and still am very impressed. Both with the phone and with the outstanding customer service.
Thank you Techlobby and Morris!!"
"iPhone 11","I bought it as a gift for my little cousin, and she likes it. It was packaged well and came on time."
"iPhone 11","I got this as a gift, and it was well received! I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical, but it looks and works like a brand new phone. If you‚Äôre doubting, don‚Äôt :)"
"iPhone 11","Perfect fit for me! The camera is great and the face recognition works surprisingly well. No complaints here."
"iPhone 11","Tres semanas probando, 95% bien solo he encontrado una falla en el aud√≠fono cuando se recibe llamada, no es clara, distorsionada y cuando la paso al altavoz es s√∫per clara. Lo dem√°s hasta el momento muy bien. Est√©ticamente dar√© un 90%, tra√≠a un ray√≥n que solo observ√°ndose bien se nota, tra√≠a el cristal protector; ya hab√≠a le√≠do todas las reviews, y dicen que cuando le ponen cristal es que est√° rayada la pantalla, es m√≠nimo solo si lo revisas bien casi con lupa, lo puedes ver La bater√≠a ven√≠a en un 84% Dentro de todo va muy bien, y espero siga as√≠ por largo tiempo."
"iPhone 11","Super bien no ha dado problemas"
"iPhone 11","The phone looks like new but costs much less. Must buy!"
"iPhone 11","Battery health at 77 . Phone looks new"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs a great phone, but after dealing with my first one I bought on Amazon I‚Äôm still disappointed. I buy refurbished because it‚Äôs cheaper and better for the environment than buying brand new. With that said, I am struggling with the feeling now that I should have bought new! My first try on the iPhone 11 left me with a horrible battery and a scratchy screen. This one I hoped at least would have a 95% capacity for the battery. Instead it‚Äôs at 86%, so in the near future I‚Äôll probably have to get a new battery for it. I‚Äôm starting to question whether it was worth it or not. It‚Äôs just frustrating because I had such a great experience buying my iPhone 6S on here. It should‚Äôve been even better with such an upgrade!"
"iPhone 11","Purchased for granddaughter she loves the phone everything works, great camera and price for top of line IPhone."
"iPhone 11","Bought from promo dealz, Phone arrived with a major deep hairline scratch on the screen and with Face ID not working. I ordered in excellent condition and was not given a device in excellent condition.

Edit: I have since returned and bought from another seller: hybrid it. And it came in perfect condition!"
"iPhone 11","Value for money"
"iPhone 11","It is good but a few scratches l. Not surprised though because I got the good condition. Overall it is great and practically brand new!"
"iPhone 11","I love the color Red, the iPhone 11 works well, the battery life is good, though I am used to the larger versions of the iPhones 6 plus, XS Max where the text size can be increased or decreased and everything is larger than life. The iPhone 11 has great videos takes wonderful pictures its everything an iPhone is all about. I give it a 8 out of 10 due to the size.... LOL"
"iPhone 11","You‚Äôll have to put service on it so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs comes with service, it cost $35 and some Change. At first I thought it wasn‚Äôt gonna work but it works just fine. It comes with a charger so you don‚Äôt have to worry about buying one, if you already have an iPhone just transfer your data to your new one. Go to your carrier and have them put service on the new phone. Log in using your iCloud and all your contacts and apps,notes etc will be on the new phone. Back and front camera works fine I got it within 2 days or ordering it. Once you set it up you‚Äôll be straight oh and make sure to update it cause it may or may not be up to date. I did have a problem downloading stuff but that‚Äôs cause my old stuff was still transferring so give it a good hour or two to transfer over and do Face ID when they do you wanna do it. It makes downloading all your old apps easier."
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono muy bonito. Lo mande a Peru para un familiar y me dice q hasta ahora todo s√∫per bien. Esperemos y ojal√° dure mucho"

"iPhone 11","UPDATE: vendor BHHT adjusted price/refund on scratched unit to allow for ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù condition, not ‚Äúgood‚Äù, & is sending missing pwr adapters, so i can def rec this vendor. ORIGINAL: Bought 2 of these (‚Äúgood‚Äù category) from vendor BHHT. The downside was that neither of the power adapters were included, as advertised, and one of them fits the ‚Äúacceptable‚Äú category description, much more so than the ‚Äúgood‚Äú category description (re: scratched screen). The batteries came in at 84% and 85%, just above the minimum 80% described. Otherwise, the iPhone 11 is a great phone, and very similar to the current generation models. Will edit review if vendor responds positively to the missing adapters."
"iPhone 11","Received my phone was a little hesitant because people said their screens came cracked my was cracked but battery life was terrible it has a capacity of 75% which once it hits 80%should be replaced. Overall is good device just wish they were a little more truthful with battery capacity"
"iPhone 11","Para ser un producto reacondicionado, es sorprendente el buen estado en el que se encuentra"
"iPhone 11","Im pretty impressed with how healthy this phone is, i expected much worse than 82%. The last refurbished iPhone i got only had 70% battery health. The facial recognition is perfect, the camera is great, and its a pretty mint color. It also came with a glass screen protector, which is pretty sweet."
"iPhone 11","Didn‚Äôt setup properly and entered infinite boot screen, solution for that is to fully shut it down and factory reset it through iTunesPc. If you need a decent phone for a good price this one is good."
"iPhone 11","The price may change overtime but I got this phone when it was about $350 which is a pretty good price for such 'modern' device. It works just fine. My only issue is that the charger port probably came in a bit defective since whenever I charge it doesn‚Äôt do well, but I can fix that. Great anyways!"
"iPhone 11","It looks good, but I am less lucky the battery is 83% only"
"iPhone 11","This refurbished phone was disappointing. The sound quality is terrible - it's scratchy and grating. And when trying to talk on the phone it's nearly impossible to hear the person at the other end."
"iPhone 11","Works really well, no scratches looked like a brand new phone!"
"iPhone 11","Phone came early. Easy setup. 88% battery life. I love it. No scratches or dings. Phone works great. Only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars is because when I make calls, the speaker is a little staticky. But since I barely use the phone because I mostly text, it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. Only when I am actually on the phone talking to someone that I get annoyed. Static isn‚Äôt there when on speakerphone.If it wasn‚Äôt for the static during phone calls, I would have gave 5 stars."
"iPhone 11","Battery health is 78%.."
"iPhone 11","As advertised on all levels!!!"
"iPhone 11","Great buy, looks just like new, came with charging head, cable, clear case and even a screen protector. Have been using the phone for a couple of days and it hasn‚Äôt shown any defects, it also has a 90 day warranty. Very satisfied, would recommend to buy."
"iPhone 11","This phone might as well be brand new!"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in pretty good condition as stated in the order, I have been using it as my daily device for the past couple of weeks with no found issues. Phone was unlocked and ready to use right away and even came with included charger and block."
"iPhone 11","My iPhone 8 developed a problem that was not going to get better so I made a decision to get a newer phone. The 90 day warranty through Amazon is what brought me back to their site to purchase another phone. The iPhone 11 I got is amazing. There was not a mark or scratch anywhere on it. The battery is in excellent shape. I can go up to 2 days without even charging it if I wanted to. From time of order to receiving phone was very good considering there was a 4th of July weekend holiday involved. Only difference is like many I miss the home button, but I‚Äôll soldier on!"
"iPhone 11","This phone looks like new and everything is good, but the battery helth is not very good for the maximal value just 85% compared to a new battery."
"iPhone 11","Much needed storage space!"
"iPhone 11","Muy buena calidad"
"iPhone 11","It came with a new charger, in perfect condition! No scratches, no glitches, no dents! It looks brand new and works like it‚Äôs brand new. I had no hassle switching my device with my carrier company. 10/10 recommend!"
"iPhone 11","Llego en perfecto estado, el √∫nico inconveniente fue que se demoro la entrega ya que nos trasladamos muy lejos para ir a retirar, pero todo lo dem√°s excelente estado f√≠sico y software, me encant√≥"
"iPhone 11","It works but I don‚Äôt think the parts is authentic"
"iPhone 11","El celular est√° en perfecto estado, no ten√≠a detalles ni rayones pero Indicaban en la publicaci√≥n que estaba desbloqueado y no era asi"
"iPhone 11","Great product for the price, just wanted a better battery % but got 83% which is satisfactory"
"iPhone 11","I need to replace the battery soon."
"iPhone 11","The battery health is at 85% when I got it not a big deal still hold a charge throughout the day. Phone runs smooth with issues everything works on it like it‚Äôs supposed to."
"iPhone 11","The phone's battery health was at 84%, which wouldn't be terrible it the iPhone 11's battery life wasn't already rather poor. Aside from that, though, the refurbished unit I received was in really good condition. Happy with the purchase."
"iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 was in good overall condition. The problem is that the battery has to be replaced which is $69+tax. This iPhone 11 was not renewed as indicated. Advanced Solutions inaccurately described this product."
"iPhone 11","Like promised; almost new. Came with charger, that little tool to take out the SIM card and a screen protector it also has few scratches but it‚Äôs okay. So far so good."
"iPhone 11","The phone when I got it look just like new I would just if you get the iPhone 11 get the purple one it‚Äôs really pretty it‚Äôs like a lavender color so yes Anna has a good battery life even though the iPhone 13 came out the iPhone 11 if you don‚Äôt want to pay $$600 on the iPhone 13 get the iPhone 11"
"iPhone 11","IPhone 11 is in great condition. Only thing to know is that I does not have an original cable. Other than that, the phone is great, 89% battery health"
"iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 has much better reception with Verizon which has been my carrier for 35 years. I purchased the 13 iPhone with the promotion and could not get a call out, or in. Within the 15 days I return the 13 iPhone and the iPhone 11 works just as well if not better for reception, and all the features. I‚Äôve had four, five, 7/8, and upgraded to the 13. Big mistake the 13 iPhone has so many problems and issues. Thank you for the good phone that I have now, my renewed iPhone 11"
"iPhone 11","The package and overall condition was very professional. The phone is in great condition, but the only caveat is the SIM card tray doesn‚Äôt exactly fit in the phone; so I can‚Äôt use it for calls yet. Outside of this hiccup, the product is high quality."
"iPhone 11","‚Ä¢ Swift delivery‚Ä¢ Phone in great shape physically (perfect!) and system clean and ready to customize for myself‚Ä¢ Great entry price for a new iphone user‚Ä¢ Battery charge hold seems good. I do not have a comparison.‚Ä¢ Would purchase again from this seller.Thanks!!!!!"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 The cell phone is working perfectly, the battery health is 84% which is good, the face recognition is working well, it has a small scratch mark on one of the rear cameras, which does not interfere with the operation at all."
"iPhone 11"," The cell phone is working perfectly, the battery health is 84% which is good, the face recognition is working well, it has a small scratch mark on one of the rear cameras, which does not interfere with the operation at all."
"iPhone 11","Writing this on the new phone, packaging was great and took only 1 day to ship"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm other comments I seen people‚Äôs phone arrived broken or damaged but mine was perfectly fine! Nothings wrong with the phone, granted it does die a bit fast but the charger provided, fixes that right up. the only complaint I‚Äôd have is on the phone, near the bottom, for me at least, there was little text saying‚Äù product red‚Äù. yes I did get the red iPhone 11 but was not aware it came with that on the back. It‚Äôs not a really big deal for me, but it‚Äôs just a heads up! it‚Äôs nothing a phone case can‚Äôt cover lol, other then that the phone is perfect!"
"iPhone 11","Awesome phone! Perfect condition!

Thanks a bunch!"
"iPhone 11","Love this product. Came with charger as well. Nothing wrong with the iPhone at all. Would buy again üëç"
"iPhone 11","The phone was in good condition. Zero marks or scratches and ready to set up right out of the box. The price beat ATT‚Äôs refurb and others. The battery was at 87%.. I was hoping for 90% or higher but thats okay. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase"

"iPhone 11","Takes great pics even in the dark"
"iPhone 11","Lo compre dudando pero estoy alegre me lleg√≥ con bater√≠a al 99%y un peque√±o ray√≥n en la pantalla,todo bien"
"iPhone 11","I ordered the iPhone 11 64GB in Green for my mom as a birthday present. I noticed the iPhone was basically in perfect condition. Unfortunately the max battery capacity was 86%, which is expected for a renewed iPhone. I brought the device to Apple for an OEM battery replacement so I wouldn‚Äôt get the ‚Äúunrecognized battery‚Äù from a 3rd party repair. Upon the repair the Apple technician noticed the Screen is ‚Äúnon-oem‚Äù. Making the original cost of a battery replacement $300 due to the ‚Äú3rd party repair liability ‚Äù. Perhaps I miss-read the description, but I thought everything would basically be original or replaced with Apple Hardware."
"iPhone 11","Very easy to get set up with AT&T!"
"iPhone 11","This phone came with zero cosmetic imperfections and I was quite pleased about that. However, only one of the speakers on the bottom actually produces sound, and the earpiece is so quiet that I always have to put people on speaker during phone calls, or just use headphones. However, that isn‚Äôt so bad, the only major issue for me is the battery life, I can charge this phone all night before work and by the time I get off at 2, the battery is at 50%, and my job doesn‚Äôt allow me to have my phone on the floor so it drains that quickly just from being on standby. Im considering either getting a refund or maybe exchanging it for the same phone, just hoping the next one doesn‚Äôt have similar issues."
"iPhone 11","My refurbished iPhone 11 arrived 3 days after I ordered it. It appeared new. No scratches/marks anywhere. Fantastic battery life! I am pleased with my purchase and whole heartedly recommend this company!"
"iPhone 11","I would recommend more people to buy refurbished phones once it comes like this one. The battery came at 94% and had no visible wear and tear. I would totally recommend it."
"iPhone 11","I am extraordinarily impressed by the quality of this iPhone. There is one barely visible mark on the cusp of the glass back panel, but otherwise it is in perfect condition. The battery capacity is at 98% and it was mostly charged when it arrived to me. The screen protector arrived already installed on the screen, and came with a two-port charging block and lightening charger. It did not arrive in the original Apple box, but in an Amazon-brand box that was undamaged when it arrived. Highly recommend if you're looking to buy a new-ish iPhone for less than half market price."
"iPhone 11","Arrived today, clean no scratches at all. Easy transfer from 7 to 11 in spite of me!!! So far everything works great. Worth the buy!!"
"iPhone 11","I loved almost everything about the phone it‚Äôs just there was one big problem when I got the phone there was an hardware problem going on with the phone, the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would not work which is my made use and when I got it check I was told after rebooting and hard resetting the phone that it‚Äôs a hardware problem and to get it fix would be a total amount of $399 so they basically really suggested me to get a whole new phone which really made me upset because I would have to wait to have a phone now because of this problem and I‚Äôm really in need of a phone at the time so it would effect me to wait for my refund to be buy a new phone."
"iPhone 11","The phone is very clean, but the battery percentage is 79%!!! That's very low!"
"iPhone 11","like every thing so for"
"iPhone 11","I was really nervous with buying a phone on Amazon but I‚Äôm glad I did it has worked perfectly for me there were not scratches or anything and the battery last forever anyways that‚Äôs it I hope this helps just try it out if it doesn‚Äôt work than return it."
"iPhone 11","Only dislike from this Amazon certified renewed device is the screen had been replaced.The glass screen protector I installed out of the box does not adhere/seal properly near the top as a result.Also, The kit would benefit by including the sim card tray removal pin. I already had one from other phone. But this is a no brainer to include for 5 cents Amazon people.Otherwise, it seems to function well, has good battery life, and included short lightning cable and block"
"iPhone 11","Battery life is great. Battery capacity was at 86% when received. Easy to transfer iCloud from my old 7 plus to 11. Have to get used to no fingerprint reader and face recognition."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs good"
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived within the time frame the seller stated. Looks great no scratches looked new. Battery life not sure yet it does last all day and I use my phone a lot. However I felt my Note 9 lasted longer.When I received the phone I had some hurtles. I had Verizon and wanted to switch to ATT. I took it to Costco Kiosk and they had all sorts of issues. My options were return the phone or try taking it to ATT store. Communication with the seller was outstanding! I initially did it via Amazon chat and then I asked for a phone number. When I called I got a voicemail and though hmm they are not going to call back. But they did, the person who I spoke with was fantastic. ATT was able to transfer my service without a problem.The morale of the story is don‚Äôt give up if it doesn‚Äôt work the 1st time. I am happy that I have an almost new phone with spending over $1000.I highly recommend buying phones through this seller!"
"iPhone 11","I have to keep it on the charger all of the time, and it loses battery even if i‚Äôm not using it."
"iPhone 11","We are not sure if we will send it back. I did not come in any original packaging. Of course it said that sometimes it won't and this did not. Nor original charger. There is a noticeable scratch on the screen and the back has marks from a previous case - no big deal because we bought a case. This is for my daughter and she is just elated to have it so she doesn't want to send it back. Yet this is the 2nd phone we have purchased from Amazon renewed and this one is not in as good of condition. No where on the packaging does the guarantee which came in the packaging does it state that the phone must function at last at 90% of its battery capacity. At first use, the battery went to like 70 ish percent after a hour of use where we just tried to set the phone up. I tried to not buy this from the reseller called KISS, but Amazon didn't give me another option. Perhaps this particular reseller isn't that great. Not sure yet."
"iPhone 11","I may never buy a new phone again. This is the 3rd time I've purchased a refurbished phone from Amazon and I've never been disappointed. One had a small, nearly noticeable scuff, but the other two were perfect. All functions work great and battery life is like new. No complaints."
"iPhone 11","so when I got this phone the touch screen didn't seem to be working and needed a hard reset to work (hold power button and then tap volume down once then volume up once), after this the phone was good and ran smooth (also had 100% battery health and there were no external flaws on the phone) except the touch screen stopped responding twice (in the middle of using it) and needed to be hard reset, so I decided to return it. I got my refund within 1-2 weeks after sending the postage out I believe. I reordered another one from these guys I got a 258 green 11 for $620 (unlocked too) which was only about 18 dollars more than what I had originally spent on the black 128 one. Anyways the new one came a few (I found 2) external flaws on the metal part of the phone, but they aren't super noticeable it didn't come with any cracks or anything just some worn out paint. Anyways the phone seems to be running great and has no problems, except for some reason it doesn't notify me when the battery is low, but for a $620 refurbished phone with 258 gb storage I think I can deal with that. Also I was hoping to get another 100% battery health on the new one and instead got 90%, which isn't horrible but I just miss having 100%."
"iPhone 11","I love this I really recommend it‚Äôs like brand new almost and yeah 5/5 stars"
"iPhone 11","There is nothing physically or visually with this product, but it has a LOT of issues. For one, the ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù isn‚Äôt from apple so I am FOREVER getting notifications about an ‚Äúunknown part‚Äù. Then there‚Äôs the fact that I was moving from a 128gb phone to this 128gb phone, but somehow I was ‚Äúout of storage‚Äù before all of my stuff even transferred over? I also have to fully turn it off and back on multiple times a day because half of my stuff will disappear and half of my apps will just turn white and not work. I‚Äôm no tech expert, but I‚Äôm not doing anything THAT wrong so it has to be a phone issue. Returning this as soon as I can get one thru Verizon (which I was hoping to avoid, but you clearly do get what you paid for so I‚Äôm gonna have to bite the bullet). Genuinely disappointed this didn‚Äôt work out for me üòï"
"iPhone 11","üëçüëçüëçüëç"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had this phone now for almost 2 years, It works amazing still and I got the 256gb because I‚Äôm someone who likes to take a lot of pictures so I need plenty of space on my phone for all my editing apps for my daily constant grading and honestly I have yet to use up all the space in my phone and it still runs perfectly smoothly. It had no damages it came in beautifully with official Apple charger"
"iPhone 11","I usually never do reviews, I just read them, but for the people wondering if this phone is a good purchase or not after reading these. I say step out on faith because it was most def a good purchase .I got the standard shipping ( cheaper ) & it was supposed to deliver a week later, but I received it the next day.The battery life was at 0% which is no big deal for me, I don't really trip about stuff like that.I expected it to not be in the original box & only have the charging cable, but I received it w/ a charging block as well & it wasn't in the original box. It was absolutely perfect as if nobody had used it.The camera is amazing, by far the best & cheap purchase . It took it a minute to transfer and update, but besides that it's been good.I was also concerned it about it not being unlocked fully as tho I seen several reviews that said their's wasn't, but mine definitely came unlocked. I'm very grateful for it & I'll be back with a week update ."
"iPhone 11","Excelente estado f√≠sico del celular, todo bien a excepci√≥n de la bater√≠a, condici√≥n de la bater√≠a al %87"
"iPhone 11","Same as new. I recommend this. They put a lot of effort into perfecting these phones. Me and my husband both got one and both said the same thing. His battery is 100% and mine is 99% thought. It can‚Äôt be more perfect than that."
"iPhone 11","I purchased the iPhone 11 for my husband. He is not as computer literate as he once was and often has difficulty with his phone. I was a bit concerned about changing his phone (his last one was an iPhone 6). The phone arrived timely and was in good condition. Set up was very easy. It‚Äôs been a much easier transition than I expected. We watched a YouTube video to figure out how to operate without a home button. I would never have guessed that this was a refurbished phone. It‚Äôs as good as new."
"iPhone 11","Thank you! I was hesitant to buy a phone on line but you proved I made a great decision. Fast shipping was told by Friday was here on Wednesday. Perfect condition."
"iPhone 11","Bought the I phone 11 black, came in looking brand new! The battery capacity is 84% which is not bad for the price. Upgraded from an i phone 7 and happy with my purchase!Update: It has been 2 months and the phone is still running great. The only problem I found was that the black paint by the charger port started chipping, I could easily take the paint off with my nail. I suggest getting a case right when you get it. But other than that its still great and has a great camera!"
"iPhone 11","Just get it."
"iPhone 11","Came with minor scratche. Run good"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm satisfied with the condition of my iphone 11 256gb"
"iPhone 11","I upgraded from the iPhone SE (2016).The renewed iPhone 11 from Amazon feels as good as new. I only noted a minor scratch near the charging port, however, I would barely have noticed this if I hadn't been looking.The software runs as smoothly as new.The battery life is excellent - it lasts me 2-3 days without charging.Touch screen has very good responsiveness.Overall, the renewed iPhone 11 from Amazon offers good value for money to a customer looking for most of the features of the latest iPhone without the expensive price tag."
"iPhone 11","Lo compre como regalo de cumplea√±os para mi hija, y excelente el producto, muy buen estado y Ella qued√≥ muy contenta."
"iPhone 11","Buenas condiciones"
"iPhone 11","Just barely at 80% battery life, expected better"
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my gf i was skeptical because it was such a good deal for the price and the storage space the phone came with. Came in perfect condition with no issues other then having to go through getting the sim activated"
"iPhone 11","Keeps force restarting"
"iPhone 11","They have much better refurbished iPhone in good condition compare to another refurbished iPhone I got from BestBuy."
"iPhone 11","we are happy with this iPhone 11. It's nice that the phone came with a silicone case and protective glass. The only sad thing is that the glass was broken."
"iPhone 11","I like the product i bought from this seller. The product looks almost unused and well packaged as well.I really like that they included a good charger which is nice of them"
"iPhone 11","So opened up the packet it was great but the life battery life is truly bad. So I‚Äôm getting it replaced."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs just like many of the current iPhones with many the same features stays of the date and no finger ID but it does have Face ID, Make sure to get a Sim card for the provider you want this phone does not come with one and you‚Äôll need it to get service"
"iPhone 11","The owner like, and appreciate your business."
"iPhone 11","I like everything about it ..no dislike"
"iPhone 11","I new it was a refurbished item, however I made my homework reading several reviews and the warranty from the seller.I meets all the expectations except for the bluetooth. It performs with a very poor connection with any kind of device, either audio or any other type; connection with get's dropped once and again at a short distance, less that a meter, so even my new generation headphones I had to be replaced by the old cord headphones from my old iPhone 7.For the rest it's ok, battery, camera, speakers, processing.If you don't mind to have this kind of issues for the price, then it's a good option, but if you cannot cope with it then do not risk your money and buy a new packaged item considering to pay in full."
"iPhone 11","Great size iPhone! Battery lasts a long time and love the camera!"
"iPhone 11","This phone is in pristine condition; not a scratch to be found! Everything works perfectly without a hitch. I‚Äôm a very happy customer!"
"iPhone 11","In first place i was a little worried about getting a phone with scratches and some hardware malfunction, but it was really an excellent decision to buy this refurbished iPhone, it came like a brand new iphone and with 93% of battery life! Excellent seller and product!"
"iPhone 11","I recently started looking into getting my younger brother a new phone so we could keep in contact but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find a older model iPhone that wasn‚Äôt renewed for sale on Amazon so I decided to roll the dice and hopefully get a unsold warehouse phone but that unfortunately wasn‚Äôt the case here, when the phone came in the package the box had dirt and pine needles in it along with the phone that was wrapped in bubble wrap and laid on top of the charger cable. In the pictures show there were metal chips along the edges and buttons on the side and a clearly visible circle shown on the back of the phone along with the label put directly on it. I did not test the phone further because I already knew that it was unacceptable to give to my brother this phone in the condition it was in, I have requested a refund already and want to warn people of the risk that comes with ordering a renewed phone that is all I have for this review and I hope whoever reads this can make a more informed decision on their purchase."
"iPhone 11","Iphone 11 fulfills its role very well"
"iPhone 11","It got here OK. I just opened the package. That is all I know so far."
"iPhone 11","Just wish the phone would‚Äôve came with a little bit more battery life. I bought it a month ago with 88% battery life, and it‚Äôs already dropped down to 87%. Other reported theirs coming with 100%. But other than that it‚Äôs a great by in a pinch!"
"iPhone 11","Came in excellent condition and very easy to set up."
"iPhone 11","Great shape. Came unlocked. I recommend it to all."
"iPhone 11","After almost 2 decades of using androids I finally decided to buy an iPhone. I didn't want to blow 1600 dollars on the iPhone 13 so I decided to buy an iPhone 11. its been 2 days and I'm somewhat still getting used to it but I will say that its looking to be one of the best phones I have ever had. This is a refurbished device and i did have some VERY light scratches on the screen but don't let that deter you away from getting one. All and all i am very satisfied with my first iPhone."
"iPhone 11","Fast delivery. Excellent product"
"iPhone 11","Came early. Product came as described only problem was the battery life. 1-5 I give battery life a 3"
"iPhone 11","El dispositivo funciona bien, el √∫nico detalle es un ray√≥n muy visible en la pantalla. Por lo menos con el protector de pantalla no se nota tanto. Por lo dem√°s, todo excelente."
"iPhone 11","Very good"
"iPhone 11","I understand that getting a used phone it won‚Äôt be perfect, but I would think that A refurbished phone would have a replaced battery. If I buy a phone and have to replace the battery, That‚Äôs an issue. For the cost of this used phone, it should‚Äôve had a new battery."
"iPhone 11","Great phone over all it works perfectly fine the battery health is 81 but besides that it a good phone it also came unlocked"
"iPhone 11","I had some thought and did some research buying a refurbished phone. The phone itself came in mint condition! No cracks or scratches. Works smoothly with no issues, good battery life. Just to verify! if you get an unlocked phone and have a hard time wonder why your SIM card is going through but says ‚Äúno service‚Äù‚Ä¶ before you get paranoid‚Ä¶ (go to the settings‚Ä¶select general‚Ä¶. Select about‚Ä¶then scroll till you see carrier lock‚Ä¶ it should say (NO SIM RESTRICTIONS).. that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs unlocked to any carrier. If your SIM does go through but it read‚Äôs it with no service you have to go to your carrier and have them switch the SIM card on to your new phone from your old device. You‚Äôre welcome! I very recommend, do your research before purchasing. Enjoy your day"
"iPhone 11","Few days in. Haven‚Äôt had any problems so far and the phone was in near perfect condition"
"iPhone 11","No estaba desbloqueado"
"iPhone 11","I would not describe this phone to be in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. It has no scratches or blemishes on the outside, but has obvious signs of wear. The unit I received had a jammed volume down button. Speakers had dirt built up and sounded muffled. Also had tons of dirt built up in crevices around the camera. Quite gross. Battery showed 89% which is ok. IMO, a new iPhone 11 is well worth the extra 150 dollars."
"iPhone 11","Phone itself is in great condition. No scratches, no cracks. Only issue I see right now is the battery life is at 85% which doesn‚Äôt seem too bad but I feel like with an iPhone the battery turns to crap real fast. Definitely recommend though."
"iPhone 11","My teenager loves the phone. It arrived with no discernible scratches, good condition, and worksgreat! This fall I will be purchasing a newer phone for myself, so this is definitely a seller I will checkout at that time."
"iPhone 11","Whenever the iphone is on battery save mode and I get a call, the screen won't turn on. I have to hang up and call back everytime. Got use to it, but was kinda dissapointed the iphone was not fully functional. If you are in US and have the possibility to return it, by all means buy it, if not, then have in mind that this sort of disperfections can happen to your order."
"iPhone 11","Battery life is good. Didn‚Äôt come damaged or cracked. Camera quality is great"
"iPhone 11","The only thing I don't like is that the page says it's new when it really isn't, because the phone had some small marks on the sides like insignificant scratches but it had them and the battery life is at 89%, it really works perfect for what it costs on the page, which is 335 dollars, is fine if you compare it with the real price, it is between 600 and almost 700, so it is fine, I would just like them to clarify that on the page that they are not new and that people decide by reading that if they want to buy it or not"
"iPhone 11","I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future."
"iPhone 11","It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that, it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts."
"iPhone 11","El celular llego en excelentes condiciones, desbloqueado y con la cantidad de memoria que ped√≠. Lo unico malo es que llego con 84% de bater√≠a pero fuera de eso y por su precio es un ganga!"
"iPhone 11","Telephone basically"
"iPhone 11","NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT, JUST THAT I GOT MY SISTERS PHONE HAND DOWN INSTEAD. HAD TO RETURN IT AS I NEED THE FUNDS FOR SCHOOL."
"iPhone 11","Had to return it. Battery health came at exactly 80%. at least the return was easy."
"iPhone 11","I like the phone but the charger does not work and I don't know how to go about getting a replacement."
"iPhone 11","El celular llego en perfecto estado, bater√≠a 90% de condici√≥n y funciona perfectamente para argentina."
"iPhone 11","In love with my new iPhone 11! Came in earlier than expected (3 days) when unboxed came with charger and SIM card removal tool. No scratches looks brand new like it was never used. No problem with it so far ‚Äúfingers crossed‚Äù hope to still be using it in the year 2023 in great condition :) my bf will be buying one ASAP! Hope his comes in great condition as well! To be fully honest I was contemplating and worried about purchasing it at first because I read some of the reviews but I really needed a new phone since I still had the iPhone 8 and the Apple Store is too pricey lol <3"
"iPhone 11","There were 3 noticeable scratches on the back of the phone, which I don‚Äôt mind cuz I‚Äôm putting a case on. It did not come in the original apple box or come with the apple charger. The battery capacity was 90%. Other than that the screen looks like new, the face recognition and the camera works fine.It‚Äôs a refurbished phone so you get what you get. You won‚Äôt know the condition of the phone until you get it. I was looking for a relatively new phone for a cheaper price so I don‚Äôt mind with the phone I got, but if scratches and battery life are a concern for you, you might want to buy it from apple refurbished or just get a new phone."
"iPhone 11","I bought an iphone 11 and it came with a screen problem. 90% battery"
"iPhone 11","Lo compr√© para un amigo, el celular es muy lindo, no llegue a configurarlo ni nada porque fue un encargo pero no ten√≠a ni un rasgu√±o, Luc√≠a como nuevo"
"iPhone 11","The battery life is good, minor scratch and fully unlocked."
"iPhone 11","I purchased this phone for my daughter. It had a few scratches on the screen but nothing major. It is refurbished so I can‚Äôt expect it to be perfect. So far the phone works with no problem."
"iPhone 11","I spent all together 388 with tax and everything. I‚Äôm very surprised by the quality. Only three things were off but it‚Äôs really not too important. Visible scratches around the back camera ring, it doesn‚Äôt harm the quality though. Another thing is that the Apple care was telling that the screen they repaired this phone with wasn‚Äôt a genuine Apple product, it looks fine and acts fine to me. And lastly a small crack in the screen but it‚Äôs nothing serious either. The battery life is 92% which is high compared to other phones I was looking at. Came with a charger and a SIM card pin. Overall great purchase!"
"iPhone 11","I did not use the Face recognition or fingerprint reader but I believe everything is working fine for me so far and I've only had my phone a few days..."
"iPhone 11","The phone works great. Minor scratches on the edge of the camera. Battery life could be better but for the price it's good. A charger was provided but no SIM card ejector tool was included which is fine since I have plenty of them. The phone came with a screen protector pre installed."
"iPhone 11","The item came quickly. It came with a charger and was on 10% when it arrived - not a big deal. I noticed a couple of tiny scratches - again no big deal. The problem was that when I turned the phone on i could see a small white dot on the bottom right of the screen. When I looked this up it said that it could be caused by the battery pressed up against the screen and could not be repaired unless we replaced the screen and it could be due to an enlarged battery. Sounded like a red flag to me. Returning and going through another seller. Fingers crossed the next one is in better condition."
"iPhone 11","Good product overall, had some moderate damage, more than I spected for the price. Face ID has given me some issues. But overall, good phone."
"iPhone 11","Can‚Äôt beat the price"
"iPhone 11","Work good, nice!!!"
"iPhone 11","amazing phone came in perfect condition of course there was some scratches on the end and what do you expect it is a used phone but the case i bought covers it so that matter."
"iPhone 11","Description said:- This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple.- This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.By the photos you can see the screen is all scratched up and there's something like food or paint on the back - clearly this phone was not professionally cleaned and was not checked for cosmetic damage. Well, maybe if the lights were off.Maybe the person inspecting the phone put it in the wrong basket. Who knows. By the feedback and description I expected what was described. Clearly not an excellent condition device. It did power up and was otherwise functional, sure, hence 2 stars. I paid extra not to have to stare at a scratch every time I pick it up. Maybe they though the screen protector that was slapped on crookedly would mask it? Now I wait for my refund while I've already bought another 11 ""premium"" directly from Amazon. Your results may vary. Good luck."
"iPhone 11","It keeps a very good condition, almost 90% new. No obvious scratches were found. The performance of the iPhone 11 is still very good and can handle most tasks for daily use. Just a good deal at this price tag."
"iPhone 11","This phone functioned very well right out of the box. It loaded from my iPhone 6 automatically with virtually no losses. All passwords, all applications, and all phone numbers transferred simply by having the two phones close together.The only thing it did not transfer was message history. As simply kept my old cell phone to check those when I needed to.The touch screen is much more responsive than my old cell phone and much faster.The battery life is good. I do not use facial recognition.I would buy from this seller again!"
"iPhone 11","This phone came in like new condition. No scratches or cracks of any sort. Works great with no issues. The battery function may not be great, but this is expected given that it is a used phone. This is a great way to avoid paying almost double the price for a new phone. Plus, you can get a less attractive color cheaper and then get a case for it of the color you like and it will totally cover the phone."
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono lo compr√© para mi esposa en condici√≥n excelente pero su bater√≠a result√≥ estar al 75 % sin contar que el pedido lleg√≥ retrasado y a una direcci√≥n incorrecta"
"iPhone 11","I have no dislikes for this phone. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 11","Everything works perfectly"
"iPhone 11","Like New! Works perfectly after I removed and replaced the screen protector, AWESOME PHONE - THANK YOU! Like new! Very satisfied"
"iPhone 11","Well I have nothing but Good things to say about this product , great quality and battery last a good amount of time , they sent me a screen protector glass thing but it came cracked but it‚Äôs all good as long as the the phone was good condition . I want to say thanks and please keep sending out good quality phones like this because now I feel like if in the near future I need a other phone I‚Äôll definitely come back to you guys so please keep it up and only send out great quality phones like this ."
"iPhone 11","Works perfectly!"
"iPhone 11","I love the size of the phone and the color."
"iPhone 11","The entire phone is great. An authentic Apple device, no scratches or cracks on the screen, perfect cosmetic condition, perfect cameras, etc etc. However there are two very notable issues I discovered not long after acquiring this phoneFirst is the bottom speaker must have been replaced with a generic one, because it's quite low quality. Not enough to ruin the phone, but noticeably poor.Second is the battery. The phone arrived with an 89% battery health. A fair health that will last me a long time, but it's not 100%, meaning they did not bother replacing it which means I'm not going to experience 17 hour battery life as advertised. Very sadOther than that, the phone is surprisingly great. Expected much worse"
"iPhone 11","This phone is perfect! It was truly in excellent condition. It was as if we bought it directly from the Apple Store. I'm so impressed! And to make it even better, the delivery came 4 days sooner than expected! Very happy with this purchase!"
"iPhone 11","I had no problems with this phone it had tiny scratches on the screen that you had to look for, to notice. I would buy one again in a heartbeat. Buy this if you want a good phone for a good price."
"iPhone 11","Came 100% perfect. No scratches, bumps, etc. Very satisfied with my purchase. And I love the color!"
"iPhone 11","Al inicio ten√≠a miedo, pero lleg√≥ perfecto est√° en buenas condiciones. Lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11","Love the phone but was dead when got it and had a light scratch on lense"
"iPhone 11","Very pleased from a previous Android loving girl."
"iPhone 11","Bought this for my mom and she hasn‚Äôt complained about issues with it"
"iPhone 11","when i ordered this phone everything was fine, till i went to go screenshot something and my power button was stuck, my phone wont even turn off, i have to wait till it turns off by itself, ill just sell it."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived with completely dead battery. After several hours charging, battery health was 84%. No telling how fast the phone will die from here, but for a ""renewed"" phone, this feels like I overpaid for a phone that needs a new battery and will not last very long. I will return. Seller indicates a restocking fee. I will update on the return process. The phone came and was loose in the small mailing box. No extra padding to protect the phone. Phone arrived okay with no visible damage. Overall, it looks like this phone was rushed out the door to me, and has a bad or failing battery. I hope the return policy works, because this phone has a battery issue."
"iPhone 11","i was super anxious buying this phone since i‚Äôve never bought a refurbished phone but after my 6s decided to not work properly i decided to just risk it and buy this phone. and it‚Äôs literally the best decision i‚Äôve made. there are 0 scratches on the phone, the battery life is at 100%, camera and speakers work great, i literally love this phone. if i have to buy another i‚Äôll most likely buy from this store again :)"
"iPhone 11","there was a scratch but it wasn't that noitcable and also there was no sim tray injector so I had a hard time pulling the tray scared of damaging it and i thought since other people had on that there would be a screen protector on it and the battery came at like 70% i thought i would be fullly charged."
"iPhone 11","As soon as I opened my phone, I had continuous notifications about how degraded the battery life is. That is literally the only reason I bought a new phone."
"iPhone 11","Wish I could provide pictures, but the phones works good. It did not come updated so you'll have to update it before adding your icloud account to it. No scratches or anything on the front or back. Only thing is around the back camera lenses and charging port there are little scrapes which is expected from a renewed phone honestly. The scrapes aren't bad tho."
"iPhone 11","Excelente estado y presentaci√≥n. Tal como fue descrito."
"iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about buying an iPhone off Amazon but so far it has turned out to be a great buy. I have transferred all my data from the iPhone 6 to the new iPhone 11 with no problems. It has been a very smooth process. I would recommend this phone to anyone. Plus, the seller was easy to reach by email and very responsive."
"iPhone 11","I honestly was scared to purchase a phone online, but both my husband and I needed phones. It took me several days to make my mind about it. We decided and both my husband and I are enjoying our phones. The only problem is, is that my husband can't get his facial recognition to work, but it isn't a big issue for him, but as for me, my phone is totally fine."
"iPhone 11","Purchased this for my 9 year old and he is content. The phone came as described(looks great) facial recognition works well and I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues in the 30 days that he‚Äôs had it. I‚Äôm pleased with the purchase and price."
"iPhone 11","works perfectly. The only thing is that it have little scratches, but It have scratches, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to see them. The battery life is at 88 so I‚Äôm ok with that"
"iPhone 11","Received my order today. Happy with the purchase. Battery health at 82%. Everything seems to be working as intended."
"iPhone 11","So excited I upgraded from se 2nd generation to this. Battery life is 86% but it still stays charged for the whole day . It was taking a minute to update so instead of transferring information from my last phone I just signed in with my iCloud then went to settings then transferred from there."
"iPhone 11","I hate upgrading when every new iphone is sold for crazy prices. I just wanted to find something new within my price range. I was definitely taking a chance by purchasing the phone refurbished but it was definitely worth it. Would really recommend especially because if for whatever reason you are not satisfied with your product you can return it and get a replacement or a guaranteed refund through amazon."
"iPhone 11","bought this back in December. looks great, no major cosmetic problems. battery life isn‚Äôt perfect but I expected that. there is a little drag when it comes to the screen but not that bad. we probably could‚Äôve returned it but waited too late so I just cut my losses. overall though it‚Äôs still doing good!"
"iPhone 11","phone came fast and undamaged"
"iPhone 11","The phone was everything I expected only a few light scratches great battery health easy set up"
"iPhone 11","Upgrading from iPhone-6S+, lots of features to get use to, but over-all very happy with purchase. Especially like to face recognition feature so now I don't have to repeatedly enter my pass code. The phone came very clean and with no imperfections that can be seen with the naked eye."
"iPhone 11","so far it works perfectly. I'm thrilled with this. Photos are great quality."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve loved using this phone! Going from an iPhone 7, with poor battery life, to an iPhone 11 has been a major difference for the better. I had to google how to do a couple things since there‚Äôs no fingerprint button anymore, but other than that I‚Äôm loving it!"
"iPhone 11","Screen was glitchy. Probably refurbished with a third party screen"
"iPhone 11","The phone was delivered on time in an excellent condition, battery is at 90% but all other components are in perfect shape"
"iPhone 11","IPhone 11 128GB unlocked. Phone itself in a good condition, I am very glad. It's pity that batter capacity at 82%, not exactly what I expected."
"iPhone 11","la bater√≠a llego al 92% funciona en Paraguay."
"iPhone 11","We did not find the screen made well, cracks super easy. We are returning this item."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in great physical condition and almost looked brand new. However, battery life did not exceed 80% as advertised."
"iPhone 11","I just received this phone today for my daughter and their are no scratches and everything went smoothly with transferring her old phone to that one but 3 hours later it started glitching. I tried to turn it off but it wouldn‚Äôt even do that. We tried for about 10 minutes then just gave up. When came back to it about 3 minutes later, it was fine. So I will be keeping a eye on it and let you know the updates tomorrow"
"iPhone 11","The phone was purchased to replace a newer phone with a severely damaged screen. Simply moving the sim card from the previous phone was all it took to start working, all data transferred quickly without issue. Cameras and all functions including face recognition work fine, battery life good although it has dropped slightly over time. Meets our needs at a far lower price than a new phone!"
"iPhone 11","Definitely worth getting comes fast, haven‚Äôt had any problemsüòÅüòÅ"
"iPhone 11","packaging sucks doesnt feel anything like the orginal unboxing from apple but the phone itself had no scratches and it turn on and it looks brand new honestly i feel like the phone should have been more expensive but im not complaining"
"iPhone 11","The phone looks brand new, and even comes with a screen protector. Only thing was it had sticky stuff in the back and was kinda dirty but it‚Äôs an easy fix."
"iPhone 11","Product works really great! Great price for what I was looking for as well! Same color I wanted and gigabyte size was OK. Are use a service called Wing Alpha. It‚Äôs based off AT&T towers and this phone works great with their service. No complaints here! Would definitely re-purchase again!"
"iPhone 11","Estamos a unos d√≠as prob√°ndolo y no ha dado problema"
"iPhone 11","Celular en un muy buen estado bater√≠a al 90% no est√° mal"
"iPhone 11","This phone is awesome except the messages are not working. Talked to Apple and my carrier and they both said I would have return the phone :( Was happy with everything else. The return process is easy so thankful for that!"
"iPhone 11","I like it because it was delievered on schedule,I am disappointed it because the entire package not include the attachment as the Apple packagesuch as no earphone, no ubs charge."
"iPhone 11","Good value"
"iPhone 11","The phone I received was just as they promoted with screen and overall appereance of the phone, but I see why someone give it up. First, the battery went down from 80% to 78% life in 11 days, even though I don't use my phone more than 3-4 hours a day, which the same phone recognizes my habits do not damage the battery. Second, the phone is just overall defective, it will randomly stop working with the touch and screen and click letters or just freeze the screen, it doesn't matter if I clean the screen or my hands, at least 10 times a day I will have a problem writing a message, going through instagram or just overall using the phone.I have contacted the company and I hope to get a refund."
"iPhone 11","The only complaint I have is the battery power drain. I wanted a longer battery support."
"iPhone 11","Just wanted to say this phone is perfect I was very scared buying it at the end of the day I was proven wrong. You diggg and the phone came with 100% battery lifeüòå. Thank you so much I‚Äôm loving it. The face recognition was perfect I mean everything works perfectly and my phone was unlocked. Got my new SIM card and put it in working perfectly. And men the audio is too fire. I recommend that y‚Äôall buy from this seller and don‚Äôt follow your instincts because I was proven wrong and I hope they keep it up. all the bottoms the audio bottom works perfectly so is the power bottom. Just updated my phone and it works smoothly."
"iPhone 11","01 equipo llego sin cargador y el otro si , uno llego un poco mas con detalles esteticos"
"iPhone 11","It's a great phone but I gave it 4 stars because it came with a scratch on the screen and there is no fingerprint reader."
"iPhone 11","Came faster than expected! Only thing is it didn‚Äôt come with a sim ejector tool, so be aware of that."
"iPhone 11","Bought an 11 from Hybrid IT because of their ratings/reviews. There was a hiccup in my order but their customer service was on it very quick. They were friendly and helpful, which I really appreciated. They got it all worked out and left me a happy camper with a beautiful refurbished phone that I probably couldn‚Äôt tell apart from a brand new one."
"iPhone 11","Recommend"
"iPhone 11","So far so good"
"iPhone 11","The phone came with a screen protector on it, 75% battery, and ready to be set up! It was a very good buy!"
"iPhone 11","Would not work with sprint service"
"iPhone 11","Phone was good, a little scratch at the top but other than that it was great!"
"iPhone 11","My phone was unlocked and in good condition plus it came with a screen protector on it I‚Äôm satisfied with it"
"iPhone 11","Came fully unlocked was able to put SIM card in with no problem, in perfect condition. There are little things that are wrong but it might be a settings thing . But overall great price for great phone so far !"
"iPhone 11","S√∫per es un tel√©fono pr√°cticamente nuevo"
"iPhone 11","i like it"
"iPhone 11","Todo funcion√≥ excelente. El √∫nico fallo que tra√≠a era que cuando se Le sube mucho el volumen se distorsi√≥na el sonido por eso no Le doy las 5 estrellas"
"iPhone 11","Bueno producto"
"iPhone 11","I like it a lot i bought it for my wife she is soo happy thanks for sending it fast right on time"
"iPhone 11","I ordered another iPhone 11. I love it. But I never received this specific one. It‚Äôs a good phone, especially since it does not break the bank too much compared to the newer models. So my rating is based on the phone in general, not this specific one."
"iPhone 11","my phone says apple parts were not used to refurbish and I may have problems"
"iPhone 11","I love my new phone so much and I am so glad that I bought it. I really do feel that I needed an upgrade and this was just the upgrade I needed! It‚Äôs a reasonable price with great quality and it really was worth it."
"iPhone 11","Impossible to believe that this was not a new phone. Very clean, looks like it was never used. They did a beautiful job! I've only used it for a day, so I may say something later, but for now I can say that I'm extremely pleased. This was a very fairly priced phone."
"iPhone 11","el producto vino como nuevo en apariencia pero vino con menos del 80% de la bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11","Recib√≠ el tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones"
"iPhone 11","the phone is gorgeous and it comes with a screen protector! sadly the battery life is only at 80% and the speakers are completely blown out. i saw reviews about how the battery life was at 100% and all of that. also my speaker the play music out loud barely works and sounds crappy. im not going to return it, far too much hassle, im just a bit disappointed. so fair warning: the speaker might be blown out and the battery wont be like new."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. I‚Äôm assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they don‚Äôt replace the batteries either. I‚Äôm a little disappointed with my experience because I‚Äôve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more ‚Äúnew‚Äù like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition."
"iPhone 11","Everything else looks good but for some reason there is a problem in speaker of the phone. When somebody calls, it don‚Äôt ring up nicely. I can barely listen the sound. When someone is calling , I can‚Äôt be able to hear it because it doesn‚Äôt produce sound. I did everything that needs to be done but still something is wrong. Is there anyway I am missing or anything that helps me solve the problems. Like I said, i tried everything and yet couldn‚Äôt solve the issue. Thanks"
"iPhone 11","Tel√©fono en perfecto estado pero vino con la bater√≠a con 80% de vida √∫til"
"iPhone 11","Works"
"iPhone 11","Nice product, well renewed‚Ä¶ recommend the seller"
"iPhone 11","It gets 2 stars because the phone works but otherwise it couldn‚Äôt be much worse. First off, I ordered the green phone and reviewed a black phone (didn‚Äôt want to deal with returning and waiting 5 days for a new one). Also, it had a 3rd party new screen on it that stopped Face ID from happening and left a consistent message in the settings about it and the battery health was at 82%. Pretty pathetic across the board. I know it‚Äôs ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù but with such ambiguity with that term (renewed may just mean it was a returned item) I excepted a higher quality phone than one I could by used off Facebook for less money. Only buy if you want to use it for a trade in with your provider"
"iPhone 11","Just what I ordered A+"
"iPhone 11","It was the perfect size and color I wanted no scratches or marks came with a charger and a sim card pin great and love it would defiantly buy again for the price!"
"iPhone 11","I liked the size and price."
"iPhone 11","It's like new, economic and it came with a charger too! It was a perfect b-day present üéÅ üëå"
"iPhone 11","The phone was in good condition. The only mark I could find was at the very bottom of the screen. It had a very small scratch that is mostly on the bezel not the screen. That's the only reason I didn't mind it. The battery health was 89% which is pretty good. It works great so far. No issues here."
"iPhone 11","Screen has a scuff but its not much visible plus there are small chips on the bottom and the top of the housing close to front area which both are visible from 12 inches away. Back glass may have been replaced there are dirts between the housing and the glass.I attached some picturesBattery life is as promised over 80%.I do not know if its water proof but I do not want to test it since there is a warning saying ""its not guaranteed as waterproof for renewed phones"".I will still keep it and give it a month or so to see if it gives me some issues then I will decide since I have 3 months return policy with Amazon."
"iPhone 11","100% battery :D also is in very good and clean condition! Amazing!"
"iPhone 11","The phone is in a excellent condition. And for that price I couldn‚Äôt asked for more. It didn‚Äôt come in the original box but that‚Äôs fine for me. The phone looks brand new and everything works fine."
"iPhone 11","Everything worked out great. Received item as advertised and in good working condition. Very happy with this purchase"
"iPhone 11","It was almost brand new and the only thing missing was the original packaging but other than that it was the best money I‚Äôve spent on a phone in a long time"
"iPhone 11","The iPhone was good, battery health was exactly 88% though stated 80% and above. in all the phone looks great, with no scratches on the screen or the body of the phone."
"iPhone 11","Bought 2 phones, one only had a scratch and works fine, the other ones ear speaker didn‚Äôt work at all had them send in a replacement but when I opened the box it has a lot of scratches on top and on the screen very disappointed after spending this much money on a phone‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11","Would‚Äôve been5 stars if it was carrierunlocked"
"iPhone 11","The phone was ok but no box and original charger. It also had a couple scratches on the screen and back. It was ok but i expected a phone with a better condition according to the description."
"iPhone 11","To anyone skeptical: be a little less. The phone itself was in perfect condition. faceID works flawlessly. Truthfully, I cannot find one scratch or blemish. The only thing I wish was just a little better is the battery health, which came in at 89%. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this product or seller enough"
"iPhone 11","excelente equipo con una camara y funciones espectaculares"
"iPhone 11","The charger is not original and the battery less 87 %"
"iPhone 11","Condiciones est√©ticas bastante da√±adas y la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a bajo rendimiento"
"iPhone 11","It is a rebuilt item that claims to be new and is fine in appearance and functionality but it only lasted 5 months. I told the provider about this and he did not reply. Be careful buying in this store as there is a risk of losing your money. I have bought about 50 items in the year on Amazon which makes me a good buyer and this supplier is the only one who did not offer me anything in return"
"iPhone 11","The phone works great, no problems came brand new. Didn‚Äôt come with a box and the charger that it did come in with didn‚Äôt work. Also, didn‚Äôt have a SIM card or the thingy to take the little tab out but I used a paper clip and that worked just fine. Tbh it‚Äôs a good phone nothing bad to say about it. Good condition connected nicely backed everything up and it was good to go. I love it"
"iPhone 11","quick delivery and great quality . soo far soo good I am still learning came with a screen protector so didn't need to buy one..would have been nice to know."
"iPhone 11","For the price, I have to admit, its probably worth it, but some aspects of the phone have really let me down. The screen is very scratched up and theres a crack in the middle of the screen. A big reason I wanted to give up my current phone was due to the battery life (which is at 83% atm), but what I've purchased is actually lower than that (82%) so now I'm questioning is this is even a purchase worth making."
"iPhone 11","crackling sound , specially during call"
"iPhone 11","the wall charger doesn't work. for that reason I give 3 Star"
"iPhone 11","I love this phone so much . Everything works perfectly fine. It‚Äôs totally a big upgrade from my iPhone 7+ I been having for 5 years"
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono esta un poco rayado, pero creo que esta bien para su precio, soy de Ecuador y el celular esta completamente desbloqueado para mi pa√≠s üëç"
"iPhone 11","Phone is perfect basically like buying it new. Comes with a charger and phone and that's it. Recommend buying a screen protector and case separately (since it's not included) so that it all comes together and you'll be ready to go"
"iPhone 11","I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this time, I was really impressed, so here it is . Phone is basically new . I got the red version and couldn‚Äôt stop looking at it . Face ID , camera and everything works perfectly . Fantastic stuff !"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived today. Almost flawless. Minor scuff on one of the top corners. A little concerned that the Battery life was at 87% capacity. Other than that , it was easy to get my service switched to this device. I did it myself online. Love that it came with a screen protector already installed on the device."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm usually hesitant to purchase previously owned iPhones due to the multitude of the theft that occur on a regular basis with these devices. This experience has been an absolute breeze start to finish. Small hiccup upon receipt of the phones but they got it resolved very quick & now I have an extremely happy daughter with an upgraded phone! Will consider purchase in the future."
"iPhone 11","WHAT CAN I SAY OTHER THAN THIS PHONE LOOKS AND PREFORMES LIKE BRAND NEW. THE BATTERY HEALTH 96%. PUT MY STRAIGHT TALK SIMS IN AND IT CONNECTED IMMEDIATELY. TOTALLTY UNLOCKED. THE PHONE EVEN CAME WITH A SCREEN PROTECTOR INSTALLED. THANK YOU BUYSPRY FOR A GREAT PHONE AND A GREAT PRICE."
"iPhone 11","There's a scratch on the screen but you won't notice it, and my daughter loves it. I was concerned about the battery life but it's fine, good as new."
"iPhone 11","The iphone is amazing battery 100% and fully unblocked works good in latin america."
"iPhone 11","Was a little skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but after reading the reviews I thought ‚Äúok I‚Äôll try it‚Äù. So happy I did. It was so easy to set up and transfer from my old phone (IPhone 6). Love this phoneüòÅ"
"iPhone 11","Came in a good condition. No issues. Works perfectly fine. No issues with camera quality, speakers or mic. Came with a screen protector already installed and the Apple charger cord (and an off brand block). Overall great product. Would recommend to a friend."
"iPhone 11","Good value for the money. Clean and in nearly perfect condition."
"iPhone 11","Bought the iPhone 11 for my wife and she loves it. She‚Äôs getting use to the new features and battery life is way above and beyond what other phones she‚Äôs had."
"iPhone 11","It was a gift for my brother-in-law in Argentina and it works perfectly so far."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs nice until it isn‚Äôt. Honestly in great condition but apple has me on edge."
"iPhone 11","good quality, works perfectly"
"iPhone 11","Estaba un poco rayado, lo importante es que funciona bien.."
"iPhone 11","Face recognition works great and the battery life is good. Lasts for over 24 hours!"
"iPhone 11","pretty good came in a android box though"
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone and it was everything is going smoothly until the next day is shut off randomly when it was fully at 70% so they were definitely something wrong I waited days for the show back on and I never turn back on so I called Amazon Apple they weren‚Äôt much help and I just waited and it turned back on but ever since then same things were happening but I can‚Äôt do anything about it months past and it literally started having such a bad glitch and changing colors till it was unbearably hard to even turn on so I returned it and still haven‚Äôt got my money."
"iPhone 11","This was not an entirely as purchase my only issue is sometimes the screen jumps. It‚Äôs not very often but I‚Äôve noticed or a few times. Also there is this weird thing that happens when I try to record videos with audio. There is this sound that overpowers the real time audio and it makes it difficult when recording. Other than that there were no noticeable scrapes on the phone. It came packaged well with a charger and set up was easy."
"iPhone 11","buen articulo, sin ninguna raya, como nuevo, trajo protector de pantalla y un forro negro, vino en una caja resistente y como dec√≠a en la descripci√≥n incluye un cargador gen√©rico nuevo, la bater√≠a funciona muy bien hasta los momentos no tengo nada negativo que decir. articulo recomendado"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm in Jamaica and i was very skeptical about buying this phone after reading some of the reviews, I almost changed my mind. But i still went ahead and its pretty good, its in good condition (8/12/10) and it works good.. only thing I‚Äôm kinda disappointed about is that the battery % came at 79% and it has a small crack on the back at the bottom and on the side near the camera. Im mostly disappointed about the battery percentage .. but even tho its 79% it still last for a good time.."
"iPhone 11","Update: After several days of back and forth with the seller refusing to replace the device I finally had to call Amazon Customer service to have them issue a return label because the seller refused to do anything to make it right.BUYER BEWARE!!!My moms old iPhone 6S is dying and she desperately needed a new phone and can‚Äôt afford to buy one.She does a lot for us like watching our kids during the week while we are at work and we wanted to bless her with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù phone.I contacted the seller in advance to make sure it would arrive in time for her birthday party.I placed the order last week and the item arrived today. As soon as I picked it up from FEDEX and got it back in my office to test it out I immediately noticed light coming from the right side of the phone. There is a huge gap between the display and the frame. You can fit a penny between them.The display itself is not cracked and the packaging is just fine so it didn‚Äôt happen in transit and was sent to us in this condition.Nobody checked the device before it was shipped out because it‚Äôs immediately obvious when you pick it up to use it.Her birthday party is on Friday and here we are on Wednesday with a broken phone.We called Amazon and they said the seller has until next Monday to reply to our request for a replacement. Hopefully we hear from them before then with a resolution.We are really sad because she deserves something nice and now we are waiting on the seller to make it right."
"iPhone 11","phone is ok"
"iPhone 11","No me agrad√≥ la condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Esperaba algo mejor. Mi selecci√≥n de pago fue en condici√≥n excelente"
"iPhone 11","Love it. Great item works great"
"iPhone 11","This phone came quickly and was in perfect shape. We had no problem getting it set up with T moble."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in good shape except for the scrapes on the screen on the right hand side. It is very noticeable. Obviously this is a refurbished phone but cosmetic issues like this shouldn‚Äôt pass quality control. The rest of the phone works perfectly but the scratches make my screen look permanently smudged."
"iPhone 11","The phone came with 88% battery maximum capacity for battery health, but otherwise the phone is like new for what it is! There are a couple little scratches that are barely noticeable, but other than that it‚Äôs in great condition!"
"iPhone 11","It keeps notifying that I have an unknown part in display, and from what my research tells me, this can cause some minor problems. Also, FaceID doesn‚Äôt work, which means I have to unlock the phone manually (which isn‚Äôt a problem but it can slow down my actions a bit). And I‚Äôve had other problems where I have to keep restarting the phone to help get it back to normal. I‚Äôve never dealt with anything like this before. Unless you can find and afford someone to help you fix these, then please beware of your purchase."
"iPhone 11","Bought one and it works majority of the time but has glitches were the phone will restart itself since I received it"
"iPhone 11","Phone works good but I'm disappointed with the battery life. It should exceed 80% but mine says 79%."
"iPhone 11","The first refurbished IPhone 11 arrive and it was in great shape. However, reception was poor and after two weeks the antenna failed. I returned it for a refund and ordered another phone. The new phone arrived today and I found that the battery life was at 82%. Apple recommends replacing the battery when it gets to 80%‚Äîa $100.00 charge. I am really unhappy with my overall experience and I expected better from Amazon."
"iPhone 11","It works perfectly! There are no scratches. I was expecting more out of the battery life but it is still great. All functions are perfect and I am very very happy with the purchase."
"iPhone 11","I bought this item and was skeptical afterwards if it would meet my expectations but honestly it does!!!! I'm so happy I took the risk I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend to anyone."
"iPhone 11","Product as described. Not a scratch on it. Works perfectly‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11","Me pareci√≥ muy bueno el producto llevo 4 meses us√°ndolo y no he tenido ning√∫n tipo de problema, en est√©tica le doy un 10/10. Es justo lo que buscaba :)"
"iPhone 11","Am supper happy I got this product even tho it's a bit scratched up on the sides. The battery life is was 100% made it mush nicer..... Thanks again"
"iPhone 11","I prefer the button because the swiping does not work well. It‚Äôs okay"
"iPhone 11","I received the phone on January 13th. I have been using it for a couple weeks, so that it could run the battery performance check. Once completed it is now showing that my battery health is at 87% of maximum capacity. It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand it‚Äôs a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine. Issues with swiping up to get to Home Screen, odd lock-up‚Äôs and having to close apps, issues with facial unlock, etc... Semi-minor things such as that. I gave it 3 stars because it‚Äôs running okay (possibly even as expected), but the battery is rather concerning, as that‚Äôs the reason I upgraded to a new model in the first place."
"iPhone 11","Best phone I‚Äôve bought from Amazon I‚Äôve gotten a couple off of Amazon. Here‚Äôs a picture from the phone"
"iPhone 11","Perfect phone for my pre-teen! Headed off to middle school in style of course! Phone does come in a box but I did have to purchase an IPhone box on eBay to look legit.Comes with charger/charger box but it‚Äôs not from apple.No signs of it being refurbished.Absolutely no complaints!"
"iPhone 11","I like the phone but my speaker is super low especially my alarms when they go off."
"iPhone 11","Sometimes it freezes but It might be because I try to move at the speed of light haha"
"iPhone 11","good apple product, it's amazing"
"iPhone 11","It was working fine battery life was more than anticipated at 96 instead of the advertised 85-90 I believe, but after about 40 days the phone would restart like it had no battery left even though it was at 100% or while it was charging. Everything else was fine and id probably still buy another phone from the company."
"iPhone 11","My dgt chose the phone and she is very happy with it. It was priced right for her budget."
"iPhone 11","Fast service! Product exactly as described"
"iPhone 11","Phone was in a very good condition only have a small scratch at the back thats barely noticeable...ordered a few months back and I haven't had any issues with it so far. Battery life was definitely what they advertised"
"iPhone 11","EVERYTHING works??"
"iPhone 11","Come with 98% battery life and everything working"
"iPhone 11","/220527iPh√∏ne 11 256GB $450 Excellent value like new. Impressive on all counts.Unit looked perfect with no visible scratches or blemishes & battery 93%.

And the battery was still at 75% after 24 hrs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.very good awesome in fact‚Ä¶If you are looking for a phone replacement and you don‚Äôt want to pay new prices this seller deserves your business‚Ä¶."
"iPhone 11","My grand daughter was here visiting this summer and she needed a different phone, so we looked on amazon and she found what she wanted. She said it was like a new phone. Thanks again."
"iPhone 11","Todo bien"
"iPhone 11","Est√° bien, cumple su funci√≥n"
"iPhone 11","Received product in excellent condition."
"iPhone 11","Expected less damage"
"iPhone 11","The screen got a lot of scratches if you look Closely.It came with a screen protector to hide the scratches and when I took of the screen protector it was kinda hard to clean up and it got a glue like material."
"iPhone 11","The phone works great, no issues so far. I am happy with my purchase so I recommend it."
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my grandson( iphone 11) cause he was the only one who didn't have one, lol,the phone was in nearly perfect condition, it had one small scratch on the screen but nothing to get upset about, mt grandson is 15 so i'm sure it will accumulate a few more scratches, he's pretty active n clumsy. He's happy so i'm happy."
"iPhone 11","Overall phone performance is pretty good. This was a great purchase. It was a gift for my daughter."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.

"iPhone 11","I recently got this phone. It was
Delivered one day early and it looks like new. It only has one scratch ( tiny). Comes with a screen protector. It is definitely a win"
"iPhone 11","The outside of the phone looks great, basically brand new. However, I was super disappointed to see the maximum capacity of the battery is 78%, and when I checked the battery health it says ‚ÄúService‚Äù and says the battery needs to be replaced. The description states it won‚Äôt be less than 80%. I‚Äôve contacted the seller but I haven‚Äôt heard back yet.

Update - Seller offered a $25 credit towards a battery replacement or to return the phone. They were pretty quick to respond."
"iPhone 11","Been using this phone for 3 months now and is going great! I had one issue with the battery life so I reached out to the seller and they covered the cost of getting a replacement battery! Very satisfied with their service and the iPhone 11 has been great since!"
"iPhone 11","Phone itself works fine but this scratch on the bottom right corner of the frame and screen is a bit rough on the palm of my hand."
"iPhone 11","Happy with purchase"
"iPhone 11","I called my iPhone 6 my ‚Äúsmarter than me phone‚Äù, this one is so far above me, thank God I have a 14 & 22 year old grandsons who can figure it out."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","Great! Saved 150 buying this phone here rather then new. Also unlocked and works with Boost Mobile!"
"iPhone 11","Honestly, after reading the reviews the good outweighed the bad. The phone is in excellent condition!!! I ordered the red iPhone 11 and I had no scratches and the battery health is 100%. Everything works very good. It is basically new. I‚Äôm so excited because I saved more money than buying one on the Apple store. Also, they shipped it very quickly. So go and purchase your phone today !!"
"iPhone 11","Sin problema alguno todo bien"
"iPhone 11","Me encanto! Llego con su cargador y en muy buenas condiciones, sin una raya ni nada"

"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono viene como nuevo, √∫nicamente trae cable cargador (compatible) totalmente desbloqueado üëèüèºüëèüèº"
"iPhone 11","Used for about 2 years, everything works great! maybe the battery lost its life a little bit, but still can use it for one day after fully charged. I decide to never buy the new product now since its not great deal."
"iPhone 11","Esta muy bonito"
"iPhone 11","I hesitated to buy a renewed phone, but read the reviews and gave it a shot. I‚Äôm glad I did! Excellent quality, works well (once I got past the learning curve, being a longtime android user) and it‚Äôs faster than any of my other phones by a long shot. I paid half of retail for ‚Äúnew,‚Äù and got an excellent phone with strong battery life to boot. This seller knows what they‚Äôre doing and does it well!"
"iPhone 11","The phone come exactly how they said it would it got here a day early it is in great condition and I am very satisfied with the product that I got"
"iPhone 11","So much for renewed.. did not expect to get a badly scuffed up screwn"
"iPhone 11","I needed an unlocked iPhone because my iPhone 6 was memory full at 64 gb. Saw this refurbished iPhone 11 with 256 gb for under $500 so a great price. LOVE the face recognition and it has a great camera. Runs much faster than my old phone and the battery lasts much longer between charges. Like the light purple also so I got a clear protective case."
"iPhone 11","Has yet to disappoint, very satisfied with product"
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ como nuevo , todo Perfecto hasta ahora"
"iPhone 11","When on a call, muffled/low and crackling sound when listening - cannot adjust to make louder."
"iPhone 11","Great price for a practically new phone. Runs phenomenal and everything looks great."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs literally like a new phone mine came in perfect shape with a block and a charger my phone didn‚Äôt come at 100% but it still charges good and stays a long time I love it didn‚Äôt have no trouble at all setting it up I got the black iPhone no scratches but this phone don‚Äôt listen to the other reviews it‚Äôs the best it didn‚Äôt come with a iPhone box but it‚Äôs still good and came 3 days early"
"iPhone 11","Looks brand new! However, the video sound isn‚Äôt playing thru the speaker."
"iPhone 11","Great product! Iphone 11 works 100% and it's new! Love it!"
"iPhone 11","Well the batter health is 85% not good not bad and the camera is bad idk what‚Äôs wrong with it the quality looks horrible it came with a charging brick thwt heated up so fast so I used my old one but it‚Äôs a good phone"
"iPhone 11","Bought through Mobile Supply, phone came under 80%, needed phone for work so I couldn‚Äôt really afford to send it back, company refunded me the cost to get a new battery put in. They were very responsive and friendly, would recommend ordering through Mobile Supply."
"iPhone 11","2 scratches other than that cel works great"
"iPhone 11","This was suppose to be in excellent condition as new‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd hate to see the ones below this‚Ä¶ has a huge scratch in the bottom left of the case and the speakers were full of crud along with a bunch of lint I fetched out the charging port with a toothpick‚Ä¶ hardly in excellent condition‚Ä¶ dead battery on arrival‚Ä¶ hopefully it keeps a charge"
"iPhone 11","I purchased an xs max before this one and it was glitchy so I had to return it so I was really nervous about purchasing another iPhone but I went ahead and got the 11 and I‚Äôm glad I did functions properly and in like new condition very happy with my purchase"
"iPhone 11","I was a little nervous getting this product after seeing the reviews.. but honestly not everyone will get the same phone some may come with scratches others may have defaults but the phone I just received works (GREAT so far ) battery life is good it does last , the Face ID works fine , setting up the phone itself was VERY easy and the phone was unlocked so all I had to do was transfer my SIM card and now I‚Äôm able to do everything on it . I‚Äôll update in a few months"
"iPhone 11","Bought the phone to replace a damaged 8 plus. As Renewed product I expected scratch free screenAnd camera lens and a new/ almost new battery. The seller scored 100% on the screen and lens but scored very poorly on the battery. It came with an 80% battery. I replace mine at 75% so it will be in the shop soon. Should have gone to Apple.."
"iPhone 11","This phone never really worked well (wouldn't install apps, face recognition worked for maybe a week, got a message saying it wasn't an authentic interface... so I wonder if I got scammed and this wasn't even a real iphone) and it had microfractures - fell off the arm of my couch onto carpeted floor (while in protective case with screen protector!) and the back totally cracked. Sent it back and the restocking fee was $574.19 on the purchase price of $579.99.There was an issue getting the Apple ID disassociated with the phone, but after that, the seller did go ahead and refund the rest of the phone price. I wish communication would have been clearer, since I initially thought the restocking fee was almost the price of the phone (that's how it came through) and I was very frustrated about that. I'm grateful it was eventually refunded since phones (especially iphones) are pricey."
"iPhone 11","Great value and great price"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with this transaction. I‚Äôm a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase. The phone doesn‚Äôt come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash. With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised. It stared right up and went through start up process. My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way. I‚Äôve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc). I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it‚Äôs supposed to be. If you‚Äôre concerned about packaging and having a ‚Äúuniquely‚Äù Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store."
"iPhone 11","I really expected it to feel used but feels new, camera works, Face ID works, speaker work it‚Äôs amazing. Even though it doesn‚Äôt come with the original box and charger the phone is really. It‚Äôs worth the wait."
"iPhone 11","My iphone 11 came with 100% Battery Health and with Perfect Quality! I switched from android, and this experience is WAYYY better than my experience on android!"
"iPhone 11","I got the phone with the battery at 87 percent battery health. It also came with scratches on the back. The camera was also a bit scratched. You get what you paid for though."
"iPhone 11","I had gotten this phone because my old phone began to get a little laggy and it works perfectly. I‚Äôve had it for more than a year now and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it. It does come with a charger but it doesn‚Äôt come with headphones which was expected. Battery life is really good too, it can last me a full day. I would reccommend this to everyone who‚Äôs thinking about getting it."
"iPhone 11","everything works fine just battery health not full but its ok"
"iPhone 11","The phone works fairly well but has a compromised battery life, and after only four months of use, charges very slowly and sporadically, making it difficult to be away from a charger for any length of time."
"iPhone 11","I wish they put instructions in it, but I googled and figured it out"
"iPhone 11","Exactly like buying one new from Apple had no issues whatsoever everything turned on n connected quickly and this seller is a dream when making a large risky purchase on a used phone because absolutely everything regarding the transaction n product were flawless n perfect!"
"iPhone 11","The phone was very nice, but some very small spots and dents make it ordinary."
"iPhone 11","Love this phone! It works and looks like brand new. Great price and fast shipping. My first time with facial recognition and that is so quick and easy to use!"
"iPhone 11","When I bought this phone I didn‚Äôt realize how many issues it had. I took it to a phone repair place to get the screen replaced bcuz when I bought the phone and set it up, I kept havin a notification in the settings tellin me that the display wasn‚Äôt a genuine apple part. Only way to fix that was to change out the screen. When I took it to the phone repair place and they opened up the phone, the battery was completely fried and they said the speakers were all failin. I had to end up gettin a brand new iPhone 11 thru the phone repair place bcuz they explained to me that for what it was gonna cost to repair this iPhone 11 that I had bought on amazon that I might as well just buy a brand new one, so I did. So yeah don‚Äôt waste ur time on this phone. Ur betta off just buyin a brand new iPhone 11 than buyin this piece of crap."
"iPhone 11","Bought this refurbished phone over a month now and so far, no issues. When setting up, the phone shows no service. I watched several videos and tried trouble shooting. I also called my phone service provider on the phone, they had exhausted the troubleshooting and the problem wasn't solved. I took it in person to my phone service provider, they charged about $24 and changed the sim card. Now the phone is working great but the phone has to be charge maybe twice per day. ü§î i"
"iPhone 11","My sister finally talked me into getting an IPhone. For a 3 month return policy I thought, why not? Not a techy gal by any means, so in a nutshell mine works well. My battery was at 84% capacity when it arrived. Very user friendly and like how I can connect easier to other IPhone users than when I had an android. Have had it for a week now and like it a lot. Still a little pricey for a phone but it does have a good camera and good responsiveness. I love my color which is Green. Also happy I went for the 128GB storage. Will probably end up keeping itüëçüèª"
"iPhone 11","Price"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in really good condition, battery levels within the information from the description. I really think it was a good deal. Phone has great working condition. Realized the phone was not unlocked for the needed carrier and because of that I contacted the seller. They attempted to assist and as it was not possible to fix it remotelly, they offered to replace or refund product right away and already provided the shipping details. It was a smooth communication and simple to deal with them."
"iPhone 11","Waited about a month to write this review just to make sure everything with the phone was working right. The phone was pretty much brand new, I did notice a few scratches on the camera but morning crazy. Battery level is a 94% which is GREAT for a refurbished phone. I have T-Mobile & the set & transfer of information from my previous iPhone was great, had no problems. Phone shipped and delivered fairly quick (within about 3 days). Will definitely order from this company again. 10/10."
"iPhone 11","Happy with everything with the product renewed Apple 11 I Phone.Ease of transferring data from old phone presented no problems."
"iPhone 11","Face recognition works great."
"iPhone 11","The phone was amazing honestly, it came early and was very easy to setup. Battery life isn‚Äôt all the way full but it‚Äôs ok, it came with a screen protector on it with a couple of scratches wasn‚Äôt visible at first but it‚Äôs ok again. Had no possible issues so far and hoping for the rest of time until I have a new phone! Was very nervous of buying at first but glad I did it! Went from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 11 glad for the upgrade."
"iPhone 11","Todo en excelentes condiciones, excepto el cargador, se ve de baja calidad"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had this phone for 6 months now and it‚Äôs smooth sailing. It works beautifully. I really love this phone, and I‚Äôm glad I got it. I would definitely recommend."
"iPhone 11","I returned the phone. Easy process and money refunded as described.The reason for return: battery life was only 83% and I wasn‚Äôt comfortable w the phones message UNKNOWN PART!"
"iPhone 11","I am pleased with this purchase. The only downfall is that my speaker volume isn‚Äôt as high as my last iPhone 11."
"iPhone 11","The device works perfectly. The back glass is near perfect. No real body blemishes or defects.But the screen has pretty harsh abrasions at the top left some of sort.Fairly sure my matte screen protector will hide this but never the less, this doesn‚Äôt exactly fall within ‚ÄúThere will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arms length‚Äù rule listed for the refurbished quality description.This is very visible much further, especially when in any sort of light source.Also the battery life was at 85% Health which is above the promised 80% so I‚Äôll eventually just get Apple to replace it at some point."
"iPhone 11","Great! Thank you"
"iPhone 11","Everything is functioning very well! I loved the device but battery life is 89 and this is a big problem for me! I texted the seller already and no answers. Careful while buying this device."
"iPhone 11","None of the IMEI was available for use by the service provider. Possible that phone was not fully unlocked. Other than that, phone looks new, clean and ready to use."
"iPhone 11","Replaced my lost XR with this and had planned on an IPhone 14 Pro. The 11 is nice so I will likely wait for the 15 Pro now."
"iPhone 11","The product didn‚Äôt come with a SIM card tray"
"iPhone 11","I like everything"
"iPhone 11","Phone is great overall but was missing the SIM card tray. Thankfully it was just a $5 item at the local phone repair store."
"iPhone 11","Love the phone. I usually get the smaller iPhone 7 and thought I‚Äôd try something different. This phone rocks. Battery needs charged once a day but that‚Äôs no big deal. I charge when I sleep"
"iPhone 11","Came in great condition"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived fast and was as advertised. I added my SIM card and was up and running in minutes. The only disappointing thing was my phone came with a poorer battery health than what I was hoping for. But it is a used phone after all. Oh well."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôll admit I was very skeptical about buying a phone off Amazon, but as soon as I got the phone I was very impressed and super happy. It came two days after I purchased it which was amazing, it‚Äôs in perfect condition no cracks or scratches. Battery life is excellent and came with the charger and charging box, as well as a screen protector. I got the case separately. It Was supper easy to set up and is overall the best thing I have purchased on Amazon."
"iPhone 11","The transfer from my old iP 6 was easy, the extra display space is nice, the display of text and images is a bit improvement. The little ratty transformer/charger was disapointing."
"iPhone 11","I bought the case however it the refurbished phone came with tempered glass a charger and wrapped. Just like new maybe a little smear print on screen however I can live like that minor scratches but very little however there were no cracks overall I am happy for what I paid for definitely an upgrade from the XR and I love my new one more!"
"iPhone 11","I Ordered for my nephew and phone is working fine. Considering his age there is absolutely no point of getting an expensive phone for him.I already got him 3 refurbished phones and no issues."
"iPhone 11","I got it"
"iPhone 11","The phone came with no scratches or scuffs in sight and it works perfect."
"iPhone 11","Phone was in as new condition. Very pleased with purchase."
"iPhone 11","Has a good battery life and is overall a quality phone"
"iPhone 11","I was a little skeptical about buying a Renewed iPhone at first, but there was nothing to worry about. The Phone was in perfect condition with maybe two or three minor scratches that were not even noticeable. My biggest concern was the battery health, but as you can see in the screenshot it came at 98% and hasn‚Äôt change since then. 10/10 üëå"
"iPhone 11","Very frustrated because I should‚Äôve known the outcome. I ordered this phone in excellent condition and it came completely scratched and knicked all over. Also, they replace the screen with a fake non apple certified so now I have a display warning in my settings. It also guarantees refunds if the battery is not at least 90% and mine came with 84%!!! I paid $100 extra for good quality and this is what they send. Don‚Äôt bother with this company"
"iPhone 11","The transfer from my old phone was painless. It's a little dicey getting the SIM card out but maybe they'll put the SIM card tool in your order. this essentially saved me $500 and keeps Verizon out of the mix which is a sure way to add on extra charges (all the while saying they are saving you money!"""
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm writing this on my new iPhone. I love it, everything works great, admittedly, the speaker quality isn‚Äôt that great, but barely noticeable. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by bad reviews"
"iPhone 11","I love this phone!It looks and works like it‚Äôs brand new.I highly recommend it Well worth the money."
"iPhone 11","Sound only works on speaker phone, very disappointing."
"iPhone 11","The phone seems fine, but the charger doesnt work. Without returning the phone, I dont know how to get a replacement charger. Any clues??"
"iPhone 11","It is nice"
"iPhone 11","Personal"
"iPhone 11","My phone was stolen, and I needed a replacement quick, definitely happy with purchase.."
"iPhone 11","Great & safe way to buy used phones. Hands down the lowest prices even cheaper than FB Marketplace"
"iPhone 11","Works just like a new phone, very pleased with it"
"iPhone 11","I've only had it a couple of days, but so far so good. I works great and it looks brand new!"
"iPhone 11","I was a little worried getting this phone with the reviews but it‚Äôs been an amazing purchase. Everything works, battery is great. 100/10 recommend:)"
"iPhone 11","my phone camera circle was cracked"
"iPhone 11","Phone was in pretty good condition even came with a glass screen protector witch was good but description says battery health tested and guaranteed 80% or higher and mine came with only %78 battery capacity"
"iPhone 11","Great phone, face recognition works well, camera is lovely. Battery life isn‚Äôt great but that may be a software update issue and not a phone issue. Service and interaction from seller was excellent when I needed it."
"iPhone 11","Phone works great but it has some minor scratches and an unfortunate ding on the bottom. Not too big of a deal for a refurbished phone. But the final price of $500 is a bit high for a used phone. I only got this one due to it being a lot faster than waiting for new ones to be in stock, if they even still make them."
"iPhone 11","Muy buena"
"iPhone 11","Got this phone on December and it is still working good. I love it. It did came with a few scratches on the screen but other than that the phone is in condition"
"iPhone 11","La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a me sali√≥ a un 85% lo cual est√° bien pero ubiera preferido que estuviera arriba del 90% de ah√≠ el iPhone me sali√≥ con las 256GB de espacio, y el estado f√≠sico esta 10/10 solo un peque√±o rasgu√±o en una esquina pero de ah√≠ el celular esta excelente, 100% recomendado"
"iPhone 11","the size"
"iPhone 11","I ordered the iPhone 11 64 gb tied to my carrier which is AT&T. I‚Äôm honestly shocked at what great condition the phone is in locks practically new no scuffs or scratches on the screen or anywhere on the body of the phone. I just popped my SIM card out of my old phone and into this one everything seems to be In working order. Very happy with the purchase face recognition works great, camera‚Äôs work great, battery life solid. I was pleasantly surprised."
"iPhone 11","Funciono perfectamente en El Salvador 100% recomendado!!!"
"iPhone 11","The delivery was before the expected date , as I request seller for that. But the phone has big dent and battery life is 80 % only . I was sending it for someone who needed it urgently. I wish I had spend 150 $ more and brought I new phone ."
"iPhone 11","This is my personal cellphone and is easy to use and good for my use."
"iPhone 11","i‚Äôve had the phone for 4 days now i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a overall 8.5 out of 10 it came nice looking with a screen protector already on it and although the screen protector did break easily and the batter health was at 82% i still would recommend the phone the camera quality is a 10/10 the quality period is just great for a phone that is reused and used for community purposes i like it üëçüèæ"
"iPhone 11","Incre√≠ble el producto, 89% vida √∫til de la bater√≠a, c√°maras incre√≠bles, reconocimiento facial, el tel√©fono vino en perfectas condiciones como f√≠sicas e internas."
"iPhone 11","it came october 15th and never had any issues with it at all, only con is the battery life, its not THAT bad but it definitely doesnt last as long as when i first had it, came with no scratches. did come with a charger, no screen protector which is fine. 8/10 :)"
"iPhone 11","I was kinda hesitant on buying bc of some of the reviews, but definitely made the right choice in ordering.No scratches & minimal damage on the frame for a refurbished phone. Definitely looks new.I got it on time! Even felt like it was super fast shipping.Came with charging cable & box AND was super surprised it had a screen protector.Definitely is unlocked & had no issues connecting to my carrier. Phone seems to work perfect so far.SUPER GLAD I UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 7!This product is so good, I‚Äôm recommending to all that will listen lol!"
"iPhone 11","Phone came earlier than expected but so thankful it came when it did. Too early to tell how great the phone is but will say that I have a happy kid, now he has access to his phone again."
"iPhone 11","I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone on Amazon but I‚Äôm glad I did it a huge upgrade for me from a iPhone 8 64gb to a iPhone 11 definitely recommend this phone if u want one just make sure u u don‚Äôt buy it from someone less than 80% reviews"
"iPhone 11","Phone screen had scratches"
"iPhone 11","Didn‚Äôt come in original apple box and definitely not an apple charger. Micro scratches all over screen but barely noticeable until in light. Didn‚Äôt come with SIM card extracter but a paper clip works fine. Other than that it works greatüòÑ"
"iPhone 11","Currently typing a review with this phone and so farrrr, no complaints. Everything is good. For a refurbished phone, it‚Äôs does so well like a brand new phone. Battery life is excellent. Love it"
"iPhone 11","The phone was great andIn great condition. Only thing is that I‚Äôm glad I ordered a screen protector because the one that came with the package was shattered."
"iPhone 11","Good phone the speaker don‚Äôt work all that well but overall kinda solid‚Ä¶ z"
"iPhone 11","Excellent and in great condition. So good I bought another one for my son. Battery life pretty good to at 86%.Arrived a day early too!Great buy."
"iPhone 11","Phone came like new condition. Very satisfied."
"iPhone 11","If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can‚Äôt express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit‚Äôs fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you‚Äôll love it calls is cool it drops when I‚Äôm in a dead zone but that‚Äôs my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af üòÇüòÇ buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies"
"iPhone 11","I had it for a month and everything worked great, but had to return it because at random times a dotted green line would appear across the camera screen (shown in pic) and couldn‚Äôt be removed."
"iPhone 11","Everything about it is good, I was nervous at first but once I got it (which was the next day) I had realized I was nervous for no reason"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Received on time, usb, adapter and sim key inside box. Phone is good as new. I‚Äôm satisfied with purchase."
"iPhone 11"," Received on time, usb, adapter and sim key inside box. Phone is good as new. I‚Äôm satisfied with purchase."
"iPhone 11","The screen on my phone is not an apple product and it's a third-party provider sometimes touchscreen gives some trouble."
"iPhone 11","I was skeptical lol, but the phone arrived in 2 days via FedEx. There are no scratches or any sign of wear. It came with 86% charge and fully unlocked. I was able to switch my sim from my android to the iPhone with no problem. I am beyond satisfied with this renewed phone. No lagging or slowness to the phone. It did come with a generic charger instead of an apple charger. That was the only thing I was sad about, but the charger works well. I'm happy nonetheless."
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ perfecto un familiar pidi√≥ un iPhone X en otro lugar y no le lleg√≥ bien no le encend√≠a por lo que me dio miedo pedir en Amazon pero me decid√≠ arriesgar y si que vali√≥ la pena me lleg√≥ perfecto y sin ni un rasgu√±o encendi√≥ y todo mi √∫nico inconveniente es la bater√≠a que est√° en el 89 n√∫mero que no es malo pero esperaba que fuese mayor ya que a algunos les lleg√≥ al 100 pero dejando eso de lado est√° perfecto muy recomendable."
"iPhone 11","Great"
"iPhone 11","There are signs of normal use, but there is a visible damage on the top of the phone and on the back there are visible scratches. But the rest of it is ok!"
"iPhone 11","Everything is perfect, only problem is when my screen is off I can‚Äôt see who‚Äôs calling. Never had that problem before."
"iPhone 11","Exceptional device. Battery life is a bit on the down side however everything works seamless. Battery percentage was roughly 85%."
"iPhone 11","Todo muy bien, en excelente estado"
"iPhone 11","So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn‚Äôt all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won‚Äôt fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !"
"iPhone 11","The phone works well, my daughter is happy, so far no complaints."
"iPhone 11","It amazing in all way"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in IPhone box. Looked great, works great. No complaints from my teenage daughter,"
"iPhone 11","Se ve como nuevo solo el cargador que ven√≠a incluido no funciona"
"iPhone 11","So far we r happy with the purchase we got it a day early I was happy about that thank u"
"iPhone 11","They helped me by calling me and sending me a new phone, I‚Äôm really happy that they actually cared about consumers satisfaction."
"iPhone 11","All good!!"
"iPhone 11","I received my refurbished iPhone and on the screen I noticed a deep scratch so I felt it with my finger and it was smooth as there was no scratch there was a screen protector over the phone when I received it so I pulled the screen protector back and yes it is a deep scratch more of a crack than a scratch small crack I wouldn‚Äôt even care if it was on the back of the phone but on the front screen is unacceptable that‚Äôs the part that I‚Äôm actually going to be looking at and it‚Äôs annoying and it is not cheap to replace hoping to return for a different phone or return for a full exchange or refund me partial of my money to fix the broken screen other than that Phone seems fine hooked it up use it for a day easy check out fast shipping the usual Amazon"
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone knowing that anything could be possible( but I was optimistic). The phone looked new and beautiful, and it had a little scratch but it wasn‚Äôt bad. The problem was that the speaker didn‚Äôt work properly and the face recognition wasn‚Äôt good either. So, sadly I had to return it‚Ä¶ I received my money back very fast and the costumer service was great."
"iPhone 11","Every things right, battery came with %100 capacity, and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx, i got the color and device storage I ordered. Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used, (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on. Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!

I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used. But its entirely like new, although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new, and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up, but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it, its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great, i came from a 2016 SE, so a big change."
"iPhone 11","I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.

I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.

Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.

CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.

Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.

iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!

So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens."
"iPhone 11","bad battery and no charger"
"iPhone 11","It was amazing and nice, thank you"
"iPhone 11","I got my iphone 11 in amazing condition. like brand new,screen and back,no scratches. batery life also,used all day and before sleep put on charger."
"iPhone 11","I was very hesitant due to ‚Äúit‚Äôs too good to be true‚Äù old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesn‚Äôt respond to voice so me saying ‚Äú HEY SIRI‚Äù doesn‚Äôt do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer there‚Äôs a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out."
"iPhone 11","The phone is almost in perfect condition. I first bought XR by mistake from the same seller, returning it now because I got 11. It is working great, battery is 98%. There is a weird big smudge on the screen that doesn‚Äôt come off, but it‚Äôs fine because it doesn‚Äôt affect the screen‚Äôs performance, actually you can barely see it.
Thank you for this product!"
"iPhone 11","Battery life only 83% not very good"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","Was working fine until my wife got a message last night saying that it didn‚Äôt recognize the battery as a genuine Apple battery. Now, it won‚Äôt charge at all. It registers when the battery is plugged in but it‚Äôs not increasing any even when the phone is turned off. This phone has been nothing but problems."
"iPhone 11","This phone worked perfect for about 2 weeks and then the touch screen stopped working. I can‚Äôt even turn it off. I know some iPhone 11s have had this problem in the past and they say you have to have something in the screen replaced. Was thinking that since this was suppose to be an excellent refurbished phone, this would have been corrected. I was wrong :( I now have a very upset son who won‚Äôt be able to take his phone on vacation with him and call and send me pictures."
"iPhone 11","No problems at all"
"iPhone 11","I received my new (refurbished) iphone 11 last week and LOVE it! It arrived earlier than expected- boxed and looking like it was brand new. No scratches or wear at all. Transferring everything from my old phone was very easy. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend. I also like that Amazon offers a 90 day return policy in case there are any problems."
"iPhone 11","All good, product met expectations but would be even better if Amazon Refreshed phones included a new battery installed."
"iPhone 11","Looked brand new. Any phone that spent its life in a case wearing a screen protector would. The battery got inordinately hot when charging and the speakerphone speaker rattled. Made me wonder how used the was.

Checked battery in settings. Maximum Capacity of battery was 73%. Unacceptable. Battery charge showed 100% on top right corner of the screen; that‚Äôs 100% of 74% Maximum Capacity, as found in settings/ battery.

Apple diagnostics indicated the battery had cycled 1500 times. A label on back of phone indicated ‚Äúnew‚Äù phone. Don‚Äôt let the packaging fool you. These phones have seen better days!"
"iPhone 11","I love this renewed iPhone 11! When I received it, it had no cracks, or scratches it was the same as a new iPhone and the phone works great. But then I checked the battery capacity and it‚Äôs only 86% I was very disappointed because when there renewed, the seller is supposed to replace the battery but clearly it was not replace."
"iPhone 11","El cel. llego a tiempo, totalmente desbloqueado.
Tiene algunos peladitos en los lados pero casi no se ven.
La bater√≠a tiene un 85% de vida √∫til"
"iPhone 11","El aud√≠fono se escucha s√∫per bajo, y la bater√≠a llego al 71% todo lo dem√°s esta bien"
"iPhone 11","Great renewed phone looks brand new. So far I have not had any problems with it. Battery is working well. Will I upgrade in a year or so YES. I will be getting it through Amazon."
"iPhone 11","I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I wanted to write the review on this purchase because this phone is like brand-new and I love it. I read the reviews before I purchased it and was a little worried because some said the battery life was not long and it was scratched but I received mine in perfect condition and the battery is 100% and it was a great buy"
"iPhone 11","As advertised- excellent condition even came with a screen protector. Will save seller and purchase from in the future."
"iPhone 11","came with a screen protector & non working off brand charger. scratches on back glass & dents on buffer. recently put a new screen protector on & noticed the front screen is completely wrecked with scratches. i bought refurbished, unlocked, 128gb, purple iphone 11. could be worse but not totally happy. i‚Äôve bought several refurnished phone & this is definitely the worst i received. battery health good tho. works really well all in all. takes great pics. works as it should but cosmetically not worth 450$.. clean IMEI, did have to connect to a computer to properly reset."
"iPhone 11","Facebook and this is excellent battery life is great only charging every other day"
"iPhone 11","Easy set up, fully unlocked. Perfect phone love it"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm overall happy. I haven‚Äôt had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. I‚Äôm not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I don‚Äôt need phone insurance.

There weren‚Äôt any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isn‚Äôt any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for."
"iPhone 11","Only used it a few days. So far it works well and am happy with purchase."
"iPhone 11","Love everything"
"iPhone 11","Great product, great price, great seller, no regrets of my purchase"
"iPhone 11","Excellent delivery time, product condition also excellent."
"iPhone 11","The phone works great! It was fully unlocked. I have had no trouble setting it up. I highly recommend. The price is great for the phone. It works like n new phone. The Face ID works great. There was no starches. It is is good shape. The batter life was at 86. Which is great for a used phone. The shipping was packed very well. It came with a charger & a screen protector. It also came with a thing to take your sims card out which is great."
"iPhone 11","The phone overall is in great condition, the screen doesn‚Äôt have any noticeable scratches or damage and the only damage I can see on the body is some light chipping near the camera. The big issue is that the battery health is already at 77% which is pretty poor, overall I‚Äôm not too upset considering the price but I expected the battery health to be higher considering others‚Äô reviews on here."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","I love the phone that I received but I ordered two not one, I‚Äôve tried to get help to see what to do or if the other phone is coming and nothing!!Everything was taken care of and my second phone was sent out quickly!"
"iPhone 11","It had a few scratches and calling people on speaker doesn‚Äôt work but over all I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it. Saved me some money so it was worth it"
"iPhone 11","Works great daughter loved it!"
"iPhone 11","Bonito, excelente estado a pesar que se nota que no es nuevo de paquete. Trajo como dicen, un cargador gen√©rico que lo reconoce muy bien, la bater√≠a yo dir√≠a que esta a m√°s de 90%. Buena compra."
"iPhone 11","Excelent.Berry good"
"iPhone 11","Amazing condition, came dead but fully unlocked, using it on Verizon, great price, and I was really scared it wouldn‚Äôt work, especially for under $400 but it pulled through guys. I got the iPhone 11 in black and I used the SIM card from my old phone and it worked right away."
"iPhone 11","Me llego muy bien empacado y sin da√±os por el manejo, muy buen producto"
"iPhone 11","Well they don‚Äôt pay me or do I have any ties with this company. But no issues with there product. I needed a replacement phone for my kid and went here to get it. The phone I order came just as I hey said it would. It was in good shape for a use phone. I would refer them to anyone"
"iPhone 11","My mom really was advocating buying it at a higher price just so we could make sure it was safe but I trusted the good reviews. No scratches, came unlocked, and had a 87% battery life. I‚Äôm pretty happy with this purchase and I‚Äôm probably going to buy another for my mom as well later."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone looks BRAND NEW like described This is not a scam it took me about 28 days to save up to buy great buy üëç definitely recommend."
"iPhone 11"," The phone looks BRAND NEW like described This is not a scam it took me about 28 days to save up to buy great buy üëç definitely recommend."
"iPhone 11","The product works fine minus a few issues for the price. I ordered a white phone and received a purple phone, but I didn't want to deal with the return and exchange process. The only other complaint I have is the speakers are messed up and sound very staticky, so that isn't ideal. Obviously not brand new, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone so....."
"iPhone 11","Phone was like new! Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with it."
"iPhone 11","Really nice, looks brand new and works great"
"iPhone 11","I've purchased refurbs on a regular basis for many years with very few regrets. I received iPhone earlier than the site forecast. The product was in very good condition and with a screen shield. Will purchase again, the price was excellent."
"iPhone 11","Great product!! No issues works and looks like new!!"
"iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"iPhone 11","I have bought from this Seller before and had no issues. I have been due for an upgrade and hate contracts so I prefer to buy my phone outright and save a little bit of money using prepaid services.

This phone came and it runs SO SLOW! Not only that, but upon inspection, the speaker holes and the charger point were absolutely FILTHY. The speaker holes were FILLED with gunk. I had to manually try to dig out all the gunk that filled the holes. The paper towel is the residue I was able to clean out. Also, the buttons are crusty. I have no idea what this phone went through before it made it‚Äôs way to me but it definitely did not match it‚Äôs description as ‚ÄúExcellent condition‚Äù, and to top things all off, the phone was at 84% battery capacity when it arrived. My previous phone purchased from this seller was at 95%.

Use your own discretion. I have contacted both Amazon and the seller, but I have decided that these greivances were not worth it to me and decided to buy myself a phone directly from Apple to spare myself any future headaches. This phone isn‚Äôt worth $300."
"iPhone 11","Soy de Peru y mi iPhone lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes, todo funciona de maravilla hasta el momento incluyendo la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a, me llego con un cargador que no es original pero carga de maravilla y adicional a ello un protector de vidrio de regalo, s√∫per encantada con el servicio ü´∂üèª"
"iPhone 11","I'm very happy with the mint color case as well as the features with this model smart phone! I went from a Samsung Galaxy Sky and this phone is far better to use, and has so much more available features. It has been refurbished and even had the extra glass screen protector! Couldn't be more satisfied."
"iPhone 11","I use this phone everyday. I like the face recognition, finger reader. I also like the size of the screen. Very satisfied‚úÖ."
"iPhone 11","it works soo wellll. it comes with a charger. the box had me a bit scared i thought it was going to be fake. but it turned out to be greatt the white is so pretty"
"iPhone 11","I really like this phone. It looks brand new and works great. There are still so many new things to learn about it that I'll have a great time
Learning everything about it. It is the same size as my iPhone 7, but the screen size is larger, so it will still fit in my pocket and my purse."
"iPhone 11","Good phone at this point in time"
"iPhone 11","Received the phone with awful battery, if you have the money i recommend getting a new one and saving, time and effort my screen isn't always responsive when texting aswell.
Other better alternatives for the money."
"iPhone 11","Phone was in perfect condition and works great"
"iPhone 11","We panicked because we were not home for a couple of days. when we returned the parcel was not at the door .. started looking but did not find .. it turned out the neighbor realized that we were not at home and took us .. we rang the doorbell but no one was .. only a day later she showed upüòÅ. glue looks new. very satisfied .. I'll check later how the phone works."
"iPhone 11","This has been the most terrible experience I‚Äôve had in a long time! I‚Äôm a disabled person receiving ssi, and I purchased this phone to have an iPhone, and at least save some by getting refurbished because I live off ssi check. Now the phone that I received is terrible, at first the package seemed to have moisture inside of it. I don‚Äôt know why or how? But the packaging came disgusting! The phone came with a screen protector that was flimsy so I took it off to inspect came to notice it has a bunch of scratches on the screen! Let alone it took me forever to turn it on‚Äô I didn‚Äôt know if it was because it came dead or broken, but I did manage to turn it on! So I messaged the seller for a refund, and he told me to call fedex and set up a pick up and practically deal with it myself! I don‚Äôt have a cellular with service to pick up and call fedex and I don‚Äôt do much with out my social worker, I messaged Amazon and told them the seller was leaving me in the dark and they told me to wait 5-7 days for my refund‚Ä¶ am not satisfied at all. They have no respect for the disable. Now I bet with in 5-7 day I‚Äôll get the same message from them telling me contact fedex or keep waiting! I hope this all gets resolved. I should not have to go there this! I will be updating‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11","el producto lleg√≥ con una raya imperceptible, no me genera mayor problema, con 91% de rendimiento en la bater√≠a, fuera de eso, impecable. liberado para todas las compa√±√≠as, lo uso con Personal en Paraguay."
"iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 that I got today is AMAZING I‚Äôm young n I usually go through mi god mom or auntie to get phones but this Time I shopped for one on my own n I had the phone for not even 24 hour so I‚Äôm going to come back in 3 weeks but absolutely amazing so far recommend!!!!!"
"iPhone 11","Considering the number of reviews of many internet items being way off the mark regarding condition I was pleasantly surprised, when I opened the package to find the the phone, in what i consider, to be in perfect condition - the phone is virtually unmarked with no scratches or blemishes , and everything functions as per the factory specs. I would definitely buy again from this seller and recommend to other potential buyers.
For a quality item with a reasonable price and fast shipping, I would rate this transaction A+"
"iPhone 11","Muy Bien en gral, salvo alguna rayones en la esquina superior derecha de la pantalla, que se notan al estar oscura"
"iPhone 11","I got a lot more than i expected. This is a really nice phone, definitely an upgrade from iPhone 6, it was better than i imagined and works seamlessly. I don‚Äôt see any flaws at all. Bought purple because it was cheapest and now its just my favorite color,"
"iPhone 11","It works really well and set up was easy! The face recognition works like a charm and the battery life is pretty good."
"iPhone 11","Phone is lighter and thinner than previous model bought it to replace 8+ hoping it would improve glitches with garage band plug ins did not. Get an iPhone SE if you just want an eight plus with upgraded chip. Other than that big screen. Dropped it from five feet up at lax on hard floor and it didn‚Äôt even tarnish it"
"iPhone 11","El iPhone me vino con un peque√±o ray√≥n en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla y con 91% de vida √∫til de la bater√≠a. Quitando esas dos cosas, todo lo dem√°s est√° en perfecto estado, todas las piezas originales.
En la caja ven√≠a un protector de pantalla y un cargador que no es el original pero est√° certificado para usarse en iphone y cumple bien su funci√≥n.
Me gust√≥ el detalle del protector ya que cuando el dispositivo tiene el protector puesto no se le nota el ray√≥n.
Con el tiempo que llevo us√°ndolo puedo decir que estoy satisfecho con mi compra, est√° aceptable si recordamos que es un dispositivo renovado."
"iPhone 11","Was perfect no complaints!"
"iPhone 11","Had an issue, and they immediately solved it and the process was easy."
"iPhone 11","i bought this phone expecting it to be unlocked. took up 3 hours of my time setting up this phone just to find out that the sim is locked & was not unlocked like it says it is. don‚Äôt waste your time getting this from. (at least not from this provider) now i have to get a refund & take the time to go through a return with this item. highly disappointed"
"iPhone 11","I was looking at this phone for a while and finally decided to buy it and it was delivered relatively quick but once received I noticed the left speaker was broken."
"iPhone 11","as far as ik of the phone came with all original parts the only 3rd party thing was the charger and it came with a glass screen protector that took away the scratches that was on the display but if u have it directly in the light u could somewhat see it but no problem it was like a new phone"
"iPhone 11","can‚Äôt hear very well when on the phone, and also been told they can‚Äôt hear me sometimes. but other than that it‚Äôs a great phone."
"iPhone 11","This is an older model Apple I-phone that was refurbished. It had some very minor scratches on the back which is what we expected. The phone was shipped with no battery power so it had to be charged before it could be used. The battery charged to 88% of a new phone. The phone worked and after a couple of weeks of use I am happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11","I am trying the used version for my new iphone. I bought this one from amazon. First time buying a used phone. I am not pleased with how hard it was to download my information from my Iphone 7 to this phone. It took 2 days and various idividuals to make it happen. It was supposed to be unlocked etc. but the guy at the verizon store even told me it was being difficult. After an hour of trying only the stuff on my icloud was downloaded and none on my apps. So I had to go home and reload all of that. Trying to remember all the user id's and passwords. I wish I would have just ordered a new phone. I really didn't save all that much either. Especially after I had to pay the guy at the verizon store to help."
"iPhone 11","Phone came like new with no scratches and no pixel damage or background images burned in that I sometimes get with refurbished phones. Battery life came at 89% so not the best but above average. Had it for a week with no problems but will update."
"iPhone 11","I liked that it‚Äôs in excellent condition. Literally looks brand new. Works perfect."
"iPhone 11","The phone works great, looked brand new. There‚Äôs literally no scratch on it, not even one. It does not use fingerprint, so far the face recognition works good, battery health is 83%, it‚Äôs quite okay. I dnt charge more than once a day even when I play game. Have no problem so far, runs pretty smoothly."
"iPhone 11","Mine came with 2 cracks on it"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm very happy with it! I totally recommend it"
"iPhone 11","No problem with the phone."
"iPhone 11","Otimo iphone."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in very good condition, and it arrived earlier than expected which was nice. The phone is quite responsive and the battery life is rather impressive. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a phone I only had to charge every other night after using it all day."
"iPhone 11","I've purchased refurbed iPhones in the past and always have been happy with the cosmetics of the phones and the battery health. This purchase was disappointing as there were numerous scratches on the upper right screen corner as well as what looks like small divots worn into the screen in a few places (like it constantly rubbed on something in a purse or pocket). In addition, the battery health was at 89% (within the 80% spec Amazon has), but I've never received a phone with less than 95% life. This is why I only rated this purchase a 3 star, however, it was delivered quickly as promised."
"iPhone 11","Was in like new conditions. Used for about 6 months with no issues."
"iPhone 11","So far great. No scratches like new."
"iPhone 11","No scratches, network compatible."
"iPhone 11","I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn‚Äôt have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!"
"iPhone 11","Came a day early so that‚Äôs awesome very small chips noticed but not enough to make the phone look bad. Battery health was at 88% so that would be the only thing I wish I would of been told. But other than that pretty happy with the phone"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","I don‚Äôt really know why, but when my IPhone 7 Plus started giving me trouble and I needed a new phone, I let someone talk me into trying an android. 2 weeks later I returned the android. I love my IPhones too much! This IPhone 11 is so nice. I absolutely love the face recognition. I bought the yellow and it is so pretty. The size is perfect!"
"iPhone 11","It was on all really good the battery life is only at 86 but it is renewed so better than expected everything is perfectly almost just Brand New except for the battery life everything else is perfect had it for a while but haven‚Äôt had no problems"
"iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about purchasing this phone online. However, the phone came in excellent condition. Not sure if was just my luck but the phone had zero scratches, the battery life is perfect (one full charge last for at least two days). Everything works fine so far. Hoping it remain the same for another year or more"
"iPhone 11","After a three year hiatus of wanting another phone from the iPhone 6plus which by the way was a replacement from my 8plus at the time ‚Ä¶ yea I know you all like what the ‚Ä¶ lol yes times was hard lol came across this phone read the reviews and since I‚Äôve purchased online in the past I‚Äôm like why not shipping was like less then 48 hrs! Phone arrived without original packaging but they did a great job package that once it get to you it‚Äôs in a safe condition! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Battery life greAt! The speaker sound is Amazing! But the Camera‚Äôs!!!!!!! Take the cake all the way home! I feel like a realPhotographer! Lol I be ready to go to nature trails etc! This is definitely a GREAT BUY for an FANTASTIC price!!! üëåüèΩ"
"iPhone 11","I don‚Äôt about y‚Äôall but my phone came really good no scratches,no screen lifting, or other problems people having to be honest it‚Äôs just a 50/50 chance"
"iPhone 11","Just as advertised perfect condition works really well just as brand new"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs been a few days and it‚Äôs working perfectly fine. Only flaws is that it didn‚Äôt come in a nice box and the charging brick plus the wires was off brand. Overall 4/5. It would be a good phone for older people in my opinion, not too good neither too bad, just right for them."
"iPhone 11","Every thing just GREAT; RECEIVE EARLY and I was VERY HAPPY. VERY HAPPY"
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ antes de tiempo, y funciona tal y como explica el vendedor"
"iPhone 11","Me decid√≠ comprar al vendedor por su reputaci√≥n, pagando un valor adicional al precio promedio, sin embargo el tel√©fono no cumpli√≥ con mi expectativa, condici√≥n f√≠sica y bater√≠a."
"iPhone 11","The phone looked like new. No scratches or dents."
"iPhone 11","Phone came with no SIM card slot because the screen was replaced and isn‚Äôt a genuine screen, it‚Äôs lifted at the corner a little bit as well."
"iPhone 11","I took a chance and ordered a phone I'm not gonna lie I was a little nervous but it works great and it was easy to set up as a replacement phone took less then 10 mins . I couldn't be happier Thank you ."
"iPhone 11","No damage, only thing is scratches around the charger port but it‚Äôs no problem to me I didn‚Äôt expect perfection. Everything works. Glad I was able to find this deal since my XS max broke. The battery on this 11 lasts longer than my old phone too. Nothing amazing, but better."
"iPhone 11","Buen reconocimiento facial, lector de huellas bien, bater√≠a vida √∫til"
"iPhone 11","Good"
"iPhone 11","It wasn‚Äôt for me but it was a gift for my niece and he‚Äôs enjoying it. If he doesn‚Äôt complain I don‚Äôt have any complaint. I totally recommend the buying of this item."
"iPhone 11","already had a screen protector installed... not a big deal, but still, refurbished? My ass. Also main issue: battery health was 86% !!! for an excellent condition phone I think that is BS."
"iPhone 11","I bout the purple 256 gb and it looks brand new! I‚Äôm so happy"
"iPhone 11","I really like this phone, hopefully it lasts for years and years."
"iPhone 11","Bought it for my wife on our anniversary. Came with a few scratches on the edges, not noticable when using the case, so not a problem. It had a screen protector on so a good addition while I bought a new one. Happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11","Muy buen producto, sin golpes ning√∫n detalle"
"iPhone 11","The phone came with 77% battery capacity. It was promised that the phone would exceed a battery capacity of 80%. I was very disappointed that it came with a lower capacity. The phone also had a small noticeable dent above the power button. Honestly if I was the seller I would not sell. Other than that the phone works fine."
"iPhone 11","Good condition. Could not have asked for more."
"iPhone 11","has a lot of scratch and voice problem"
"iPhone 11","Fue una excelente compra mi hija est√° contenta con su primer celular muchas gracias."
"iPhone 11","Received the the renewed iPhone which was posted as in ‚Äú excellent condition ‚Äú pretty fast, at first look it looked ok , mb not excellent but good condition but i have noticed that there is a screen protector installed already and I decide to remove and fully inspect the phone , and OMG after removing the screen protector the display itself was heavily scratched, with even a dent :( . I don‚Äôt know if the phone can be categorized as ‚Äú fair condition‚Äù or ‚Äú bad condition ‚Äú with such a heavy damage, trying to return it , hope everything will go smoothly and will give them another chance because they have many renewed options, and hope this is an exception not the rule, how they are trying to hide scratches and damage installing a screen protector instead of replacing the display. Will update as soon as i will receive the replacement."
"iPhone 11","Everything works fine no issues with the phone itself but it has a lot of scratches on the back of the phone and the edges also. Besides that the battery life, face recognition, and actual phone functions all work perfectly."
"iPhone 11","Todo bien"
"iPhone 11","Overall the product was ok. But it had many signs of use and several scratches on various parts of the device, for this reason, I decided to return it. The seller was very attentive in the return process, I had no problems returning the product and getting the amount back, great seller."
"iPhone 11","I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I‚Äôm feeling I should‚Äôve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that‚Äôs I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren‚Äôt plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I‚Äôm afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I‚Äôve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase..."
"iPhone 11","Everything is good except the annoying buzzing noise while in speaker mode.Returning the product."
"iPhone 11","I bought this for my daughter and she seems to love it."
"iPhone 11","Product received today on time, in the correct memory size and color, and in excellent shape. However, upon inserting the SIM card and trying to set it up, I learned that it is carrier-locked to Boost Mobile. I had ordered a phone compatible with T-Mobile. Hopefully Boost can unlock it tomorrow but now I have to wait another day when I should have just been able to swap in my existing SIM card and be ready to go. I would recommend ordering unlocked for nearly the same price, not worth the hassle trying to fix this."
"iPhone 11","There is a spot of darkness on the screen and it came with a screen protector already on it. The battery health shows up as needs service so I am not sure how fixed up these phones are before being sold. There are no scratches so it is great in that aspect but I really wish the battery was in better condition and there were no screen problems.EDIT: It has been one full day and I have noticed at darker screen levels that there are actually three different spots with really bad screen darkening, very disappointing and would probably return if I had not spent the day transferring everything to this phone."
"iPhone 11","Face recognition work well except with mask obviously the battery is not that high but for a iOS it‚Äôs normal."
"iPhone 11","Not a single issue with this, hooked up to straight talk no issues. No scratches or dings or cracks in sight, pretty much a brand new iPhone. I love it so much!"
"iPhone 11","the smartphone arrived with some deep scratches on the screen! I did not like!"
"iPhone 11","My first Apple product since the ipod. Which still works BTW. I suffered through a whole series of android phones. Had issues with them. Calls dropped, bad reception. Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail. I blamed my carrier and I was wrong. It was the phones.Easy to use. Better texting/fast fewer mistakes. More intuitive. So simple to pair accessories. Just works effortlessly. I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time. It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap. I am now an Apple person. My next computer will be Apple too. I am done fighting with technology. I want it to work for me and Apple does that."
"iPhone 11","I got excellent because it said no scratches on screen. The phone I received had scratches and dents on the bottom of the phone."
"iPhone 11","This product seems to work fine in the US. Someone told me my phone comes up from Mexico whenI called. Not sure but I think that is the phone because I am using the same service that I have for years. I wish apple had left finger reader on iphone11. The battery life is better then iphone7.Over all I am happy with this item."
"iPhone 11","I bought the phone for my 16yr old daughter she loves the phone, we ask for yellow they ran out, but he made sure to call me and ask what else color so my daughter pick green, it‚Äôs cute minor scratches but nothing serious. It‚Äôs fully unlocked and works perfectly.. this is the 3rd One I have purchase through this seller never disappointed."
"iPhone 11","works perfectly fine, the screen isn't cracked or scratched up. The volume is good, the entire phone works like it's new. Nothing's wrong with it."
"iPhone 11","honestly was super scared it wasn‚Äôt gonna work but it came in early with no scratches no cracks and a screen protector already which love y‚Äôall for that. Everything was easy to set up and it connected to my sim card perfectly"
"iPhone 11","There possibly will be a couple small scratches on the sides but other than that nothing else is broken or scratched. I would totally recommend buying this and is such a great price for this phone. Also it‚Äôs very easy to set up and I had no issues with it so far!"
"iPhone 11","Everything cosmetically about the phone is perfect. The phone came with 84% battery health which is the only flaw but the phone doesn‚Äôt die quick it works great.No scratches, no dents it is perfect."
"iPhone 11","I'm not giving it one star because the phone came in good condition and works fine. The only reason I feel disappointed is because the phone has an non-Genuine aftermarket screen, no where in the description does it say the phone has been replaced with non-Genuine apple parts. I feel disappointed because now the phone has a message saying that the display is not genuine. I felt like I was cheated and would like to request to have another one shipped out but with the genuine screen. Or at least a partial refund. So buyer BEWARE if you buy from here you could get shipped an iPhone that has non genuine aftermarket parts. Which we all know the quality is no were near a Genuine apple part."
"iPhone 11","I took my new phone to the phone store to have my information transferred from my old apple 6 plus...bought a screen protector and case for it...When the clerk was putting on the screen cover he noticed some scratches on the screen.. Very disappointing... He was almost done.. I have kept the phone because of all the time and effort and added expense.. MISS not having a button on the bottom... Wish one would receive a booklet when you make a purchase like this.."
"iPhone 11","So far everything is great looks like a new phone also came with a tempered glass awesome"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs perfect <3 My date got me this phone as a v times day gift and I just absolutely love it there‚Äôs no problems at all (not a paid review lol :,> ) there are a few scratches on the side but it‚Äôs nothing a phone case can‚Äôt fix the back and front came with no scratches for me but for everyone it may be different there are absolutely NO issues with the phone easy to get in adding you Apple ID and everything it‚Äôs just a overall good phone! So if your having second thoughts about ordering this Don‚Äôt it‚Äôs indeed the real deal :> ok I‚Äôm done now follow me on Instagram and tik tok tho and if you need more information on this feel free to contact me @Jxstsalt on Instagram and tik tok <3"
"iPhone 11","pleased with phone so far after a couple months"
"iPhone 11","I've had a good experience with renewed devices on amazon in the past, but this one is an exception. The phone arrived with 84% battery health. The whole point of it being ""renewed"" (refurbished) is that, in general, the device will look and function roughly the same as it did when it was new. Getting 16% less battery life from a full charge straight out of the box is unacceptable."
"iPhone 11","Got this phone for my son! Was worried at first because it is not brand new but it looks brand new and has been great so far! Completely unlocked and ready to go!"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs very good. Packaging was poor but is good. Fully unlocked. It dies a hole lot quicker then the others I do say but not a big deal since there‚Äôs iPhone chargers everywhere in my house and car. The charger it came with crumbled in my hands the minute I touched it which was unusual. Very good not 5g though"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase. I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone, but it actually turned out great! I bought it in the best condition I could get, and everything works as it should. Color is gorgeous too!!"
"iPhone 11","I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I‚Äôve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It‚Äôs nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it‚Äôs unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I‚Äôm digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you‚Äôre looking into this phone I‚Äôd say go for it. I‚Äôm on day 1 and I‚Äôm excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I‚Äôm 1 month in with the phone and it‚Äôs still working great no issues at all."
"iPhone 11","I just purchased this for my 14 yr old daughter and it's a really good phone. It's almost like new. It has a couple of scratches but you really can't tell they're there unless the phone is up to your nose. Other than that it's perfect."
"iPhone 11","I purchased this refurbished iPhone 11 and am glad I did. This company expedited shipping, my iPhone arrived quickly, well-packaged, & works like a charm, everything as promised & super easy setup. The battery life is impressive. I will buy from them again."
"iPhone 11","My daughter said that everything works wonderful and it's a great upgrade for her"
"iPhone 11","I loved the phone itself came in great condition wish the battery lasted longer though but everything was greatüíØ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11","i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it‚Äôs so new and improved that i don‚Äôt ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i‚Äôve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn‚Äôt know how to use itüòÇbest part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i‚Äôm pretty pumped about that.thank you!!"
"iPhone 11","This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length. Not true. Very very visible scratches. However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them. Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount. I guess you get what you pay for."
"iPhone 11","Expensive Phone was received with Scratched screen .....85% batt life"
"iPhone 11","No me agrado que no se mencione que la bater√≠a estaba a un 70 por ciento adem√°s que el mismo tel√©fono indica el cambio de la misma"
"iPhone 11","Super for I phone 11. Excellent reconditioned phone. Like new and everything works."
"iPhone 11","So far no problem about this product at all"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 So far so good, just that the battery takes long period to charge and it runs out fast."

"iPhone 11","Bonito el equipo, buen estado, compre 2 y uno tiene el 84% y el otro el 82% de vida de la bater√≠a. Hubiese esperado al menos un 90%"
"iPhone 11","Glad I purchased this phone that is unlocked and renewed on Amazon. So far so good. Sure beat paying all that $for a new I phone. Phone looks new, no scratches or anything. Glad to find it!"
"iPhone 11","Ultimately, this is a purchase I live to regret. It takes forever to charge and when it came, the screen was not working. I chose not to return it, because where I‚Äôm from, customs would have charged me almost $100 to send the phone back. The phone functions ok, but the battery life is an annoyances and I had to get the screen fixed. The company was however, swift with their response to rectify, however I wished the phone actually functioned as described."
"iPhone 11","Definitely worth the money! My phone came in perfect condition and looks and performs like new. My only complaint is that the screen protector it came with was meant for a size smaller phone so the screen protector cracked easily but my phone is fine!"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","When i applied my first screen protector it looked fantastic. But it made the touch sensitivity almost non responsive. I tried another one and the same thing happened. I am upset because i would have liked my phone to be compatible with accessories such as a screen protector. Other than that it is fine."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","The phone we purchased works perfectly and it looks brand new. I bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. The seller was very responsive and we received our phone on the date it was promised. Very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11","came brand new no blemishes and it came todays early even tho it‚Äôs not shipped by Amazon. Everything works perfectly fine and it‚Äôs totally unlocked I changed company‚Äôs twice it doesn‚Äôt come in apple box or charger but they put a new charger I. There"
"iPhone 11","First off, this phone came super early which is already a plus. It looks and runs like new but the max battery capacity is 86%, which isn‚Äôt great. But other than that, it‚Äôs a great phone. Easy to setup and in great shape. I will update in about a month if using it.UPDATE: it‚Äôs been a little over a month and it still runs just fine. Sometimes the touchscreen is a little off, but very rarely. Camera is great, battery is pretty good. Would recommend. Thank you!"
"iPhone 11","im using it to wrote this review right now. its an amazing phone and love the color!"
"iPhone 11","e comprado varios telefonos en amazon , este en particular a venido como nuevo y con 100% la bateria , creo que hice una excelente compra ."
"iPhone 11","I'm so upset for the battery condition 76% and i bought it for excellent conditon, I need to understand"
"iPhone 11","Est√©ticamente perfecto, pero la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° en 78% m√°s baja de lo que ofrecen.De lo contrario todo bien"
"iPhone 11","i assumed the phone was gonna be crappy because i didn‚Äôt fully trust the fact it i was being ordered from amazon but i stand corrected. the phone came perfect no scratches nor defects, battery last awhile, and the face recognition works how it would on any other phone. the phone isn‚Äôt slow or hard to use, it really is amazing! if you‚Äôre thinking about buying from this seller please do so :D"
"iPhone 11","It was good but it had its little problems . Annoyed me for the most part but I got over it . I mean it works so heyy , I‚Äôm good ! Just make sure uu look everywhere b4 spending your money bc I spent it then boom a lower price somewhere else"
"iPhone 11","Bought and taken abroad only to find out mircophone is broken. People can't hear me when I speak."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs been 4 months since I purchased this phone, have been using it every day since. Phone came perfect not scratch or any signs of previous use. Haven‚Äôt experienced a singe problem in 4 months and have tears and used just about every feature of the phone 5/5"
"iPhone 11","I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare."
"iPhone 11","Everything was perfect other than the screen protector is a little crooked."
"iPhone 11","I bought the purple iPhone11 it came I perfect condition!!! I was a little weary about buying a phone off of Amazon, but I‚Äôm so glad that I did!!! The only complaint I have is the battery health is at 88% but that‚Äôs nothing a new battery can‚Äôt fix!!!! I love it so much!!! Highly suggest getting it if you are on the fence!!!"
"iPhone 11","Grandson good the new phone"
"iPhone 11","After 1.5 weeks I‚Äôm very happy with the phone. Was in great condition. I upgraded from a 6s so big difference. Battery life is great and getting used to a newer model. Overall really happy!"
"iPhone 11","Vida de la bater√≠a 100%, detalle en la pantalla. Cargador gen√©rico."
"iPhone 11","Purchased in Mid-June 2022, screen began glitching almost immediately and eventually would not turn on at all. By July I contacted the company regarding an exchange, they informed me that they do not do exchanges and I need to purchase a replacement and they will refund me once they receive the defective product. I have yet to receive my refund. I'm pretty annoyed because if I wanted to spend $600 on a phone I would have just purchased new..So far so go on the replacement phone"
"iPhone 11","I love my new iPhone 11, I was a little apprehensive about making this purchase, as it is my first time, but I am happy with making this decision."
"iPhone 11","it‚Äôs cute cause it‚Äôs yellow but it do be kinda laggy lmao its chill"
"iPhone 11","Working awesome and good battery life. Updated easily to the latest IOS 15."

"iPhone 11","Works great. Good for its price."
"iPhone 11","I love the phone, to be honest. It's cool. This is my first iPhone, so I'm just going to see how it goes."
"iPhone 11","This iPhone works great there are no flaws! Highly recommend"
"iPhone 11","I am happy for the 28K people who seem pleased with these refurbed iphones. However, my phone could not be used as the ATT store could not get the antennae to load up my service. I tried to return but it was very difficult for me to understand. Then life happened and ran into some issues. 3 months later, I took the phone back to the store hoping it would work, but didn't. They would nopt allow a return because of no warranty. But even if I had purchased the warranty, I did not understand the icloud steps I had to follow to return. Anyway, BUYER BEWARE. I am fortunate that my burned up $350 will not affect my wellbeing and it was a lesson learned. Glad I didn't spend another 100 on a warranty that would have been rejected anyway."
"iPhone 11","A few scratch not much of a big deal, but iPhone gets so hot, battery dies so quick and the charger it came with doesn‚Äôt even work ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥"
"iPhone 11","En l√≠neas generales est√° bien, s√≥lo que la bater√≠a no dura casi nada"
"iPhone 11","It arrived in time. Looks just like new. Will be getting my sons phone here"
"iPhone 11","Great company! Shipping was super-fast, iphone 11 was in absolutely perfect condition, battery at 94%."
"iPhone 11","Phone was great! No scratches, battery life was at 85% I believe which is decent. Everything was working and it‚Äôs been great. A great upgrade from an iPhone 8 plus!"
"iPhone 11","i ordered from this seller because they offered 4 day shipping. Its been 4 days now and they are now saying to wait another week. im sure the phone will be nice, but if you can get it from somebody else more truthful."
"iPhone 11","Ear speaker is not working it is really really low cost $55 to replace yes easier than sending it back"
"iPhone 11","The product came in a really cute box, with a screen protector inside the box and a charger(not an apple one but it works fine) and the sim card removal tool. I‚Äôve been using the phone for a couple of days now and so far so good."
"iPhone 11","Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it we‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get to it.WELL, let‚Äôs just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like it‚Äôs brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but it‚Äôs something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new"
"iPhone 11","So far no complaints. However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual. All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study. It's amazing all the things this phone can do!"
"iPhone 11","Love my phone it came very quick. No scratches are dents looks new works well I've had no problems with phone I don't do reviews so I can honestly say this phone is worth buying not a scam and also came in apple boxing"
"iPhone 11","No se indic√≥ en la descripci√≥n que estaban da√±ados los bordes de la c√°mara"
"iPhone 11","Works great. No issues. Best phone I‚Äôve ever had. Got the yellow one."
"iPhone 11","Face recognition, fingerprint reader and wonderful color made this iPhone unique. My son loved his iPhone and feel happy about that he is owning one."
"iPhone 11","Phone came with very deep scratches on the front screen and the letter"" I "" on the screen is a dead spot. It's not working. Very disappointed. Wasted $150usd in my country fixing it because where I live, I can't return it. Wish they can send a new phone for me"
"iPhone 11","Very minor cosmetic damage that was easy to cover with a case and a screen protector! Battery life is about as good as possible."
"iPhone 11","Fast shipment, Excellent Condition and I love it!"
"iPhone 11","My mom loves her phone. Arrive faster than expected and thank you."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had this pastel purple iPhone 11 now for over a year and I‚Äôm still very happy with it!! I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ to the 11. I got it with 256g of memory so it holds a lot. Battery and everything else is still going strong. Very happy with this purchase"
"iPhone 11","I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn‚Äôt at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn‚Äôt come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn‚Äôt read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!"
"iPhone 11","Este es mi tercer equipo renovado comprado en amazon , y no me ha decepcionado.Fisicamente el equipo en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, trae el protector de pantalla puesto (tenia un globito pero algo diminuto)El telefono es muy rapido, la bateria vino 88%, y tengo unos 2 meses ya con el equipo y esta funcionando perfecto‚Ä¶solo en 1 ocacion se me frizio , solo lo apague y encendi y todo bien‚Ä¶me parecio leer que traia un cover de regalo el cual no lo trajo pero si el cargador con su cable generico.Recomendado"
"iPhone 11","The phone works everything‚Äôs I would buy again."
"iPhone 11","Decided to go the refurbished route after buying new phones up to this point. I am very pleased with the phone (iPhone 11 128gb). It looks and performs like a new phone, for a significant savings. The battery health is at 85%, but that is more than enough to last a full day and then some."
"iPhone 11","My mom's old iPhone from 2014 was on its last leg so I figured I would surprise her for her birthday. The iPhone 11 was quite the upgrade so she was thoroughly satisfied. Definitely did not disappoint."
"iPhone 11","The first phones received had a crack on the screen the battery life was 94%. I received a replacement three days after realizing and the replacement had a battery life of 84%."
"iPhone 11","I was very hesitant to buy it, but I actually exceed my expectations. It's super nice, I give it a 10/10 aesthetic. I haven't used it much yet, but as far as I've seen it, I liked it."
"iPhone 11","What I dislike about this phone is my charge port stop working and I am still paying for this phone every month. Never again will I buy a users phone that someone has rebuilt it"
"iPhone 11","Okay for the price but chipped/ cracked bottom corner of screen and the battery wasn‚Äôt 80% life or more. Would not called in like new condition. More like used or damaged."
"iPhone 11","I didn‚Äôt expect that the iPhone continues remains me that the screen replacement used is not an original apple part"
"iPhone 11","My daughter is enjoying her new phone she went from a 7plus to the 11"
"iPhone 11","Phone is in good condition. But the battery life is not as promised."
"iPhone 11","This is perfect I think the phone is reasonable in price and quality so I would strongly recommend."
"iPhone 11","Very high quality and as good as new!"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in looking almost new. No visible scratches or dings. Battery life of 84%. Lasts all day"
"iPhone 11","came in good condition, battery around 80%. i miss the fingerprint reader, the face recognition is kind of annoying. good camera. good value for the price"
"iPhone 11","I was a android and now iphone due to my kids lol"
"iPhone 11","all the bad reviews made me worried, but I ordered it, and not only did it come three days early, but its beautiful and has no issues whatsoever, also came with a screen protector placed on perfectly! buy it :)"
"iPhone 11","Its not opened before xmass. Im happy it arrived earlier than expected. More comments after xmass"
"iPhone 11","All good, but only top speaker was broken."
"iPhone 11","La vida √∫til de la bater√≠a baja, los dem√°s va excelente."
"iPhone 11","All i can say is ‚Äú It‚Äôs worth it‚Äù i did hesitate to buy it but it looks, feels and works like a brand new Iphone.. thank youüî•üî•üî•"
"iPhone 11","I recommend this purchase."
"iPhone 11","Exactly what I was hoping for!"
"iPhone 11","Buen almacenamiento y buenas c√°maras"
"iPhone 11","So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it‚Äôs definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that‚Äôs why the phone won‚Äôt power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn‚Äôt hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I‚Äôve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that‚Äôs broke & try to sell them thinking they‚Äôve found a dummy because most won‚Äôt return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I‚Äôll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm happy with my purchase"
"iPhone 11","Excellent condition, affordable price"
"iPhone 11","Todo est√° muy bien reconocimiento facial y el lector de huellas dactilares la bater√≠a est√° en 89% no √∫nico que no llego los Auriculares y el cargador que no es muy bueno demora mucho en cargar"
"iPhone 11","We bought this phone just before Thanksgiving 2021 for our daughter for Christmas. I was unable to provide an honest rating due to not opening it.Now that it's been a few days, my daughter absolutely loves it! She states that the battery life is exponentially greater than her old iPhone 5 and the photo quality is immaculate! She loves the green color and everything about it!"
"iPhone 11","I just received and turned on my iPhone 11 from Amazon. Everything appeared to be in good shape except... my battery max capacity is below 80% !!! Also, I have had ZERO luck with tech support. I expected better quality than this."
"iPhone 11","Bought this phone for my Dad, works perfectly and arrived like brand new phones. No scratches or any issues"
"iPhone 11","I really need a phone as I just had a galaxy S8 and bought it in 2018 and back in 2020 I decided to put my money towards this instead of a more expensive brand new iPhone and I‚Äôm glad I did! It did come with a very faint scratch on the screen which isn‚Äôt noticeable unless you really focus but after putting a screen protector on it isn‚Äôt even visible anymore."
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve purchased iPhones from Amazon in the past, all amazing‚Ä¶though there are bad reviews about this iPhone I still ignored them and purchased one anyways‚Ä¶ I received the phone about almost a week later after purchasing it everything on the phone was fine great condition and everything worked except‚Ä¶ The phone didn‚Äôt register SIM cards, which means that the phone would never be able to get turned on. It would only work on Wi-Fi I even took it to geek squad for a diagnostic and they told me the phone had internal damage and that the previous owner had already ran a diagnostic on the phone‚Ä¶ meaning that the phone I bought had already been returned for the exact same reason and the seller still sold it again‚Ä¶ Save your money and time and purchase one in stores(only good thing is the seller returned my money within a week of me returning it)"
"iPhone 11","Didn‚Äôt realize that it didn‚Äôt have an EarPod hookup. Now I am waiting for a separate attachment to use for audiobooks. Recommend including this piece of information in product description for tech challenged buyers to know at time of purchase"
"iPhone 11","Bought it because my mom needed one and they were out of stock at Apple. But it came with a very scratched screen, battery only charges up to 80%. Price was way to high. I might return it if I‚Äôm able to come back home within the return period."
"iPhone 11","This phone arrived in ""like new"" condition. The battery is better than my old phone was and will go all day wirhout needing a charge. Would buy again."
"iPhone 11","No finger print reader,, battery life sucks right , there is something‚Äôs you can‚Äôt do"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 It‚Äôs a good phone but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I had to unlocked the FaceTime and imessages ( from turning green ) on. If have any of those difficulties please contact apple right away and they‚Äôll help you. You‚Äôll thank me in the future. üíØif you notice , the purple phone always tends to work better than the other colors phone by looking at these reviews."

"iPhone 11","I love the color and how it protects the phone from the sun when in the car."
"iPhone 11","After maybe a month or 2 of having my phone it started turning on and off by itself all the time and then I looked it up and then found out it was because my screen had risen. Now keep in mind I had not taken my phone out of its case for the entire time of having it! The cause of this problem was that they didn‚Äôt properly install the screen back on. I then texted the owner and I was asking for them to fix it because it‚Äôs not my problem, it‚Äôs there‚Äôs. The owner will not take my phone back to fix the damages they have caused. Sorry if your phone messed up, THEY DO NOT CARE!"
"iPhone 11","Stoked about this new phone"
"iPhone 11","IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.
Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11","My cousin said it worked fine"
"iPhone 11","This product came in really fast and although I was skeptical it came without any scratches or any damage to the phone and a phone charger. Although it didn‚Äôt come in the original apple box it came very secure. If you want a cheaper iphone like this one I would definitely give this one a try"
"iPhone 11","Camera should be better. It freezes sometimes."
"iPhone 11","Todo funcional."
"iPhone 11","Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!"
"iPhone 11","I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an arm‚Äôs length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.
So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!

I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!"
"iPhone 11","Battery life is aweful"
"iPhone 11","My daughter loves it and the color is cute"
"iPhone 11","it had some scars on the back camera and the side of the phone, and the battery life was only 91, which was way much lower than I expected. Besides these things, everything worked just fine, but still I wouldn't say I am satisfied with this purchase"
"iPhone 11","My boyfriend just bought me this phone as a late anniversary gift since he knew I had been wanting one, it came unlocked as it was stated. I wish it didn‚Äôt have little bits of scratches in the corners shown in the pictures but once I put a case on it won‚Äôt matter. I also would of liked the battery life to be 100% but again, I‚Äôm just glad it looks as good as it does and I appreciate that it even already had a screen protector on it. And it came super fast! Thanks so much (:"
"iPhone 11","The phone is much smaller then I thought it would be. My old iPhone 8 Plus is around 6‚Äô1 inches and this phone is smaller then that. Yes it advertised that the battery max is 82%. However if that‚Äôs the case the price can come down some more. The packing was really bad. The phone setup is slow but after that it works pretty good. If you care more about size then I wouldn‚Äôt recommend because it‚Äôs smaller then the 8plus which is 100 dollars cheaper and works really the same. However, if you don‚Äôt care about size then I recommend you get it but the battery might be a issue."
"iPhone 11","sin duda alguna ha sido una de las mejores compras que hecho Celular vino muy bien empaquetado tra√≠a un cargador y cubo para cargar muy bueno La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a es excelente yo cre√≠ que iba ser menos por ser reacondicionado pero tiene un 95% de bater√≠a Y en la parte f√≠sica del tel√©fono lo veo muy bien est√°n muy bonitos tal vez tiene unos peque√±os raspones y Rayones en la pantalla pero son casi nulos , Y si funcion√≥ el desbloqueo de la banda as√≠ que s√≥lo puedo decir que es la mejor compra que he hecho y que recomiendo mucho al comprador buyspring"
"iPhone 11","Just like new, I haven‚Äôt had any issues since I bought."
"iPhone 11","El iPhone 11 lleg√≥ bastante nuevo y con protector de pantalla incluido y esta desbloqueado vali√≥ la pena hacer la inversi√≥n y la bater√≠a esta en 89% de vida √∫til nada mal para ser un tel√©fono usado ."
"iPhone 11","The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller."
"iPhone 11","It's a good buy, but the charger didn't work."
"iPhone 11","Perfecto intacto pr√°cticamente, env√≠o s√∫per r√°pido, bater√≠a al 87% de vida, lo dem√°s todo perfecto no hay quejas!! Recomendado."
"iPhone 11","So far this has been a great phone."
"iPhone 11","Everything fine. I was afraid of buying this but I don't regret it."
"iPhone 11","I bought this refurbished. It was in excellent condition except for 3 small chips to screen. I paid $500 and it is well worth it. Why buy a new version when you can wait a year and buy a refurbished one for half the price?"
"iPhone 11","The phone is too big"
"iPhone 11","The phone is fully unlocked and it's really nice."
"iPhone 11","Is my fist time buying a renewed item I paid $400 plus taxes I got this iPhone for my 13 years-old boy. First things he saw was scratches on the back and the sides also some spots on the camara lenses but it was used already we thought was ok. Then he found out the speaker sounded bad the camara flash didn't work until a few shots it was like on/off but what made him feel disappointed was the battery life not even 80%. The only thing he liked was the color ""red"". I will return it as soon as possible."
"iPhone 11","This is my second purchase of a revamped iPhone from Amazon. So far, so good, great price, & I have 90 days to return if something goes bad!"
"iPhone 11","I order an unlocked iPhone 11, and received it with sim lock on it.. I tried troubleshooting with Amazon, apple and was also told to call T-Mobile but they said the phone didn‚Äôt belong to them. I was very sad as I was excited to set up my new phone.."
"iPhone 11","Liked the product but didn‚Äôt appreciate the double charge from my checking account n still have heard no response after I have messaged to customer serviceVoukx someone please take care of this matter immediately. Very disappointed about the situation"
"iPhone 11","El producto parece nuevo.

Excelente vendedor.

Muy recomendable!"

"iPhone 11","No charge battery I want to return this product ever time battery ishu."
"iPhone 11","When I was looking for a new phone, I didn‚Äôt care that it was renewed. I‚Äôve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!"
"iPhone 11","Phone looks great , functions as expected,. Battery says 85% but its shot, drops fast. I have to charge it twice a day."
"iPhone 11","The phone was great, ready to use, almost no damage. One very small scratch on the screen, doesn‚Äôt seem to effect the phone at all. We put a screen protector on it, and it‚Äôs been just as if we bought it brand new."
"iPhone 11","I like the phone but I noticed the Len on camera was cracked"
"iPhone 11","A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good."
"iPhone 11","My husband is not very techie. He only wants a phone that works and did not want to pay a high price for a new IPhone. The warranty is good on this and he is just fine with a refurbished one."
"iPhone 11","My phone arrived earlier than expected. I am almost 82 and I was able ON MY OWN set up the new phone and transfer all the data from my older phone to the new. I'm very happy with my Iphone 11"
"iPhone 11","Phone is in perfect working condition. & at a Great price, I am happy."
"iPhone 11","Overall the phone is nice but little things like me constantly getting notifications because the screen was repaired not at an apple facility or my AirPods breaking up and disconnecting constantly (when they are new and it worked just fine on my old phone) those things annoy me anything else is fine"
"iPhone 11","Sorry I submitted a little message saying I didn‚Äôt receive it but it was in my mailbox üòÇ thought Amazon would‚Äôve delivered it. Product looks good though. Appreciate what you guys do keep it up!!!"
"iPhone 11","Trustworthy"
"iPhone 11","iPhone came in perfect condition. No scratches or damage. Works great!"
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono ven√≠a en muy buenas condiciones."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 While to the eye it's alright at first impression, the phone is has a lot of issues. The ""like new"" description, and the overall positive reviews of a renewed device seemed promising. However the device I received was COVERED in scratches, it hadn't even been wiped off it seems.

The top volume button as well is sticky, I don't believe this device was even cleaned. In the era of COVID, that's a bit concerning. If it weren't for the hardware inside working alright this would've been a total flop.

While I am glad to have an IPhone, I am not glad to have had the wrong idea from the plethora of reviews of the Renewed service. I thought I would be receiving a ""Like New"" product, not a Iphone that was just chucked out.

Overall, it's a good phone. The renewed service however needs some work. At the very least cleaning should've been done."

"iPhone 11","My opinion of this is great! Great customer service, phone looks new, only a few tiny scratches by the charger port-Unnoticeable!! Very satisfied. Thank you!! Treasa Welch"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","This phone was delivered earlier than expected! It was packaged well and looks brand new! No damages or scratches. Battery life is great. The phone came with a charger and key to open the sim tray. Definitely worth it!!!"
"iPhone 11","When I first got it, came with an android charger. Something was already off about it when I logged into my iCloud account, said something was unfamiliar w one of the parts inside the phone, talked to Apple to see what they could do about the error message that kept popping up & they couldn‚Äôt do anything. Later I noticed the corner of the screen lifting WHILE it was in the heavy duty phone case & with the screen protector on. Fell out my hand once n the entire screen popped out & screen went black‚Ä¶ this bitch alone is too heavy in my pocket & w a fat case around it for protection makes it even heavier. Battery life doesn‚Äôt last a full 8 hr shift. Just go to Apple my guy, save yourself some time & money"
"iPhone 11","Outside of the fact that the screen is VERY fragile I give this a 5/5 ! It came faster than I expected only 2-3 days and was in perfect condition totally unlocked you could put any SIM card in"
"iPhone 11","Upgraded from 8 Plus Love face recognition and size easy to hold"
"iPhone 11","I was sold a stolen phone."
"iPhone 11","** 6/10 update: the screen has chipped in multiple places from just being in my pocket due to the screen protruding from the fame.**6/7 (date of delivery) the functionality of the phone works overall really well, but i assume the screen had been broken before refurbishing. the new screen on it is protruding from the frame of the phone itself. i bought a protective case and screen protector for it before i got it, and regardless of me having both on, i dropped it one time and due to the protrusion it chipped the screen even with the screen protector on. i won't be buying from this seller again."
"iPhone 11","4 stars because there were a few tiny scratches on the screen but everything else was in good condition. Got exactly what I ordered. Battery capacity at 100%"
"iPhone 11","I ain‚Äôt even gon cap I was a lil scared to buy this thinking imma get scammed or something but it‚Äôs better then what I expected easy set up works and looks new"
"iPhone 11","Device was so dirty that I hardly couldn‚Äôt hear the word. The next day I was to use the service for sending the item back was so costly that I spent some extra money. Shame, the seller!Would say, there wasn‚Äôt any refurbishment."
"iPhone 11","I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It‚Äôs supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost iPhone into this phone and it wouldn‚Äôt work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won‚Äôt have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone."
"iPhone 11","Tel√©fono en buen estado, todo funcionando, liberado de f√°brica"
"iPhone 11","Never again! I bought this phone ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù. My service provider could not activate it, could not repair the defective speaker, that should not have been defective in the first place & another specialty repair place also could do nothing to fix the phone. So after throwing good money after bad, I was stuck with a defective phone. Tried to return the phone but was told I could not return it. Managed to get it activated eventually & have to use ear buds or speaker phone function to use the phone. The Face ID does not work due to the speaker issue. Very, very disappointed"
"iPhone 11","I like that the phone looks like new, is fully unlocked (can work on any networt) while supporting LTE. It also fully functional.However, its keeps bring a notification that the screen is not genuine and has very poor battery health of 73%.I think the seller should have stated these major drawback so that the buyer makes an informed decision"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had this phone for a few days, and everything seems to work great! The battery life came at 86% But I can go with the whole day without charging it! At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isn‚Äôt even any scratches or marks that I can notice. This package was delivered on time and it even came with a charger and a cube (not apple products but still work just the same). So glad I was able to save some money!!"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in great condition. The only dent or scratch was on the screen and it‚Äôs nail thin and very hard to even spot. The battery health is 81% which is definitely on the lower end, but the battery last a good amount of time before I have to recharge the phone. I would recommend others to purchase as well."
"iPhone 11","I bought it to use for work so I could stop running my regular phone in the ground.But the battery only lasted about 1 hour before it would go dead every day.Had to return it."
"iPhone 11","It works, it was easy to setup. No issues"
"iPhone 11","No scratches anywhere"
"iPhone 11","Had to put into dfu mode with a cable and my Mac to be able to get it to come back. Returned it and had to order elsewhere due to them being out of this model"
"iPhone 11","Came in great condition, exactly what I expected"
"iPhone 11","Happy"
"iPhone 11","Face recognition and all of the above"
"iPhone 11","Works great! Have had for 6 months now, no issues.One minor kink is that blue tooth will fall out all of a sudden. But that seems to be only thing, which is totally fine. Great purchase."
"iPhone 11","I was satisfied with my purchase"
"iPhone 11","Good"
"iPhone 11","Very good phone I did not even now it was renewed because there were no cracks or anything. I recommend"
"iPhone 11","Phone works fine but if you have boost and try to use this phone it won‚Äôt work I switched back to metro by T-Mobile so that I can use it"
"iPhone 11","The phone is a good value compared to new phones and looks like new."
"iPhone 11","After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous however, phone arrived just about brand new. Glass had no imperfections, phone had no scratches. No internal issues, sound, quick loss of battery. Functions as a new phone.I'm pleasantly surprised"
"iPhone 11","Purchased thus phone for my daughter and she loves it. Not only does it look brand new it also works like it's brand new. My daughter only orders her phones from this seller and she's always pleased with her purchases."
"iPhone 11","No headphones set provided."
"iPhone 11","Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it."
"iPhone 11","It pares up with my hearing aids . Music shuts off when someone calls and starts again when you end call Super quality with both calls and music."
"iPhone 11","What I like is that the iPhone came in lest then 4 days. Came fully unlocked and ready. With a great battery Health and the phone works Just fine."
"iPhone 11","Work great for my mothers hearing aid"
"iPhone 11","Please don‚Äôt listen to what other people say. The reviews almost made me not buy. My daughter just received her phone it is everything yes it is worth the money üí∞ I‚Äôm about to order me one. Gamer is nice, it‚Äôs loud and brand new we love love love it so much"
"iPhone 11","I was quite surprised by the high quality of the device I received. It came in a timely manner. It arrived in a better condition that I expected. I‚Äôve had it a couple weeks now and seems to be working well."
"iPhone 11","This phone is so amazing, with great battery life, and everything works fine."
"iPhone 11","El producto est√° en perfectas condiciones, la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 93%, lleg√≥ en una caja gen√©rica pero muy bien empacado."
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ en excelente condiciones."
"iPhone 11","Came in pristine conditions can not tell it was ever used. I love it and so much better than the 8+ I had"
"iPhone 11","I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon it‚Äôs quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money."
"iPhone 11","Looks like it‚Äôs brand new !! What I like is I got a very nice phone for very reasonable price I definitely do it again !! It works great"
"iPhone 11","Buen producto, sin marcas ni da√±os externor visibles o palpables, bater√≠a al 100%de vida."
"iPhone 11","I think they gave me great service and the next time I buy a phone I am using the Amazon renewed service!"
"iPhone 11","Do Not Buy.Do Not Buy from Chubbiestech.Took the time to set the entire phn up only to discover the camera was internally broken -- lines through the viewing image and visible after pic taken. Returned.*Update -- it's been 17days since the date the item was returned and i still haven't Received my money back. Maddening.**Update -- 29days now and still no money back. Bill is due. To avoid paying interest on credit card, must pay bill in full.Amazon says i will receive money back within 7days.If I'm late paying bill, or don't pay full balance i pay penalty or interest. Same back if Amazon is late with refund.Amazon delivered $10 gift card for compensation. This is fair."
"iPhone 11","Theres nicks on the top right corner of the phone from it being dropped and the battery condition is at 89%. Definitely disappointed and wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone to buy one if you expect it to be in excellent condition even if it says thats what you‚Äôre getting."
"iPhone 11","Sending it back . No speaker and volume"
"iPhone 11","this was a present for a friend so I can give no input."
"iPhone 11","The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11."
"iPhone 11","The sound while talking on speaker phone is terrible quality. You can barley hear the person on the other end or be heard from others."
"iPhone 11","Thank you so much for the delivery and works amazingly ... please though be careful with packaging,found a few scratches"
"iPhone 11","I ordered my phone on wednesday and it came on friday. i love it. i set it up checked all the important things like system speed, speakers, flashlight, front and back camera and i even airdropped a picture to see how fast it would download, it works perfectly fine for now, i‚Äôll try to update if anything happens. it doesn‚Äôt have any cracks or scratches. i would definitely recommend. i read the reviews and i was kinda scared but it turned out just fine. and i‚Äôll also try to update with results of battery life."
"iPhone 11","Really shocked I could purchase on Amazon but got it quick and works perfectly! Very happy and look forward to more purchases"
"iPhone 11","Un poco maltratado"
"iPhone 11","Had poor battery life and scratchy audio that was a defect with the renewed iPhone-just be aware that should you return within 90 days you may not get 100% refund which is much different than what is written and I quote ‚Äú If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us within 90 days of receipt of your original purchase (or within 1 year of receipt of a Renewed Premium product) at Amazon Renewed via the above options. You can request either a full refund or a replacement unit if one is available - your choice.‚Äù End of quote."

"iPhone 11","Easy to get started installs like a breeze wonderful memory Great Phone"
"iPhone 11","I got it like new. Perfect condition. Thank you so much. Battery was at 85% but it's okay."
"iPhone 11","battery life was 85% decent but can do better 100% recommend this device"

"iPhone 11","Several noticeable scratches on the screen"
"iPhone 11","Worked like a charm, no mistakes"
"iPhone 11","Good"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in good shape. No issues so far. No scratches, dents, or missing glass in the screen. Works well. Battery seems to hold pretty good."
"iPhone 11","I absolutely love this! It connected to my carrier right away and it had no dings or cracks or anything. I was definitely skeptical about buying an ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù phone online but I‚Äôm glad I did. The battery life is at 88% which is still good and it‚Äôs nothing to get a new battery when it comes time for that. But otherwise, I‚Äôm super happy with the phone."
"iPhone 11","The phone's battery is terrible. It came in as a maximum capacity of 77%. That's worse than my old phone. Phone gets really hot quick do to this issue."
"iPhone 11","My biggest disappointment was the battery life. It came at 86% and by the time I downloaded the IOS 15 update it went down to 81% üëé Was hard for the phone to keep charge after that. Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful. Thought the seller I choose would have been a better purchase for me as they had so much 5 stars...guess not"
"iPhone 11","I was very scared to order a renewed phone but I was in such need of a new iPhone. I love the iPhone 11 I got, it works extremely fast and the battery capacity is at 100%.. there‚Äôs a couple of scratches at the top of the iPhone but it‚Äôs not doing anything harmful to the phone."
"iPhone 11","the screen was very scratched, I did not even turn it on, I think it would be a good idea to add an option to select the condition of the phone, I think that there are refurbished in good condition and excellent,You can maybe add those options with different prices for each one, so it is not random."
"iPhone 11","I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i‚Äôve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!"
"iPhone 11","Looks and works great...as advertised"
"iPhone 11","Great product so far I‚Äôve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month it‚Äôs been a little over a week and it‚Äôs been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever I‚Äôll keep you updated however.Continued: about a month later idk I‚Äôve been having connectivity issues. It isn‚Äôt that big of a deal but it‚Äôs too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but I‚Äôll probably end up getting a new one."
"iPhone 11","The phone is beautiful got it activated and everything but one small problem I noticed was that when I have my dark mode on you can see a blue mark in the middle of the phone wish I didn‚Äôt have that problem but I won‚Äôt replace it unless the screen gets worse. Ps I received it like that be careful everyone"
"iPhone 11","First this thing came lightning fast to my doorstep. I ordered it 4pm CST on a Wednesday and it was in my hand by 1pm CST the very next day. Not even 24 hours! Bravo! When it did show up my VERY picky teenage step-daughter began to put it through its paces immediately. It's been 7 days now and I haven't heard a single complaint about the battery being dead, and she is literally on her phone 12 hours a day. She loves the camera too. It also came with a charger which seems to be a hot commodity in this household, and they even put a tempered glass screen protector on it for us. 1st rate service at half the price Apple wants for one still in the box!"
"iPhone 11","Some of the letters on the leyboard sont work other than that ut works"
"iPhone 11","It will overheat and sometimes the screen had delayed reaction, Other than that it works fine"
"iPhone 11","The company that bought this phone bought a stolen phone therefore the phone was reported locked to the carriers. The had to take it to get fixed and payed an extra 50 dollars. Other than that, the phone works great"
"iPhone 11","I love this iPhone perfect size. Phone came to me looked like it was brand new. There was not a make on it and it works great."
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono dec√≠a que est√° excelente s√≥lo est√° bien a secas, se inive un poco,se nota bastante que es usado, pero en fin , esperaba algo mucho mejor‚òπÔ∏è"
"iPhone 11","Excellent battery life! Have not tried fingerprint reader or Face recognition yet. Extremely happy with the function of the phone overall."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived looking good, no scratches, battery condition was barely over what they say at 82% all was going well, had a facetime call, so speaker phone worked.... then I tried to make a phone call. Ear speaker would not work. volume maxed, no sound. Easy return! got my refund and now will look elsewhere. First time with renewed phone, and will be my last. Probably got a bad one I know, its ok. The refund was quick and pretty fast once the phone showed received at the sellers address. Worth a gamble, its a numbers game. This time didnt work out for me, no problem."
"iPhone 11","This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won‚Äôt take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I‚Äôm aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It‚Äôs like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it‚Äôs a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It‚Äôs well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!"
"iPhone 11","I love how fast the phone is and camera is so clear. But the battery dies quick. My IPhone XR lasts way longer so I‚Äôm gonna have to replace the battery soon."
"iPhone 11","Excellent IPhone 11 Brand new condition very good battery health Very good seller Five star ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in great shape, battery seems to hold a charge very well. I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the ‚Äúaccessory not supported‚Äù notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although don‚Äôt count on the accessories."
"iPhone 11","Very happy with this purchase. Looks and works like new. Packaged well and shipped fast! Thank you!"
"iPhone 11","It took 5 working days to get to South Africa,and im happy with everything"
"iPhone 11","Was a gift for my daughter and her only complaint was a dead spot in the screen"
"iPhone 11","Phone came with a screen protector and in decent condition. Only scratches were paint around the camera. But pretty much brand new looking! Ordering another for family!"
"iPhone 11","Phone was in good shape, fully functional but it's clear that the battery was never checked as it clearly states that the battery life warrants a replacement."
"iPhone 11","My daughter absolutely loves her new phone no cracks it even came with a screen protector and a chargerShe was so excited üòä"
"iPhone 11","I got this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old son and he is very pleased with this gift which is not an easy feat. iPhones are really good phones in general and I am happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11","recommended!"
"iPhone 11","Phone was unlocked and i could move it to my provider easy"
"iPhone 11","Wish the battery life was better but overall the phone is great"
"iPhone 11","the phone was pristine. Long battery life, great purchase"
"iPhone 11","I was sold this phone that has a not good battery quality which will eventually result in me having to replace the battery I also was told by the guy who just fixed my screen that whoever owned this phone previously took out the speaker screens probably when they were cleaning them so that will cause issues for me in the future to because it‚Äôs now easier for things to get trapped in thereY‚Äôall really should not be allowed to sell phones like this"
"iPhone 11","Me agrad√≥ porque no tuve problemas para su configuraci√≥n. Lo compr√© para llevarlo a claro Centroam√©rica y muy bueno."
"iPhone 11","So far I'm pretty happy with the phone, I definitely prefer it over Android phones. I don't have to use fingerprint reader so that's why the low review on that. Only drawback I can't use my own ringtone/text message tones. My boyfriend tried to and he said it was difficult. I had to read up a little bit on how to use the phone."
"iPhone 11","There is a blur on the startup screen. There are also several scratches on the screen and the camera. This phone is not in good shape. I will be returning this phone."
"iPhone 11","I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price."
"iPhone 11","100% battery and looks brand new. Very happy and did not expect the battery to be new, especially since it was a renewed phone and not renewed premium."
"iPhone 11","El telefono funciona perfecto, reconocimiento facial y bateria excelente, tiene un detalle importante en una de las esquinas, pero eso no afecta su uso, elResto impecable, gracias"
"iPhone 11","So right it's good. Given its refurbished, I understand the battery not being 100% but the only issue I could think of is the charger port. I'm having it looked at soon. Overall 9.3/10 would recommend buying most definitely."
"iPhone 11","I bought it for my son who broke his last one. He's very happy with it. It was in prefect shape and the battery life is excellent so far"
"iPhone 11","iPhone came as describe and works well. Noticed some little bumps at the bottom of the screen but nothing bad and knew some minor imperfections were bound to come with the phone. Battery was at 83% capacity which is good. Just wish the phone was packaged better because it was clanging around in the box and could have caused potential damage to the phone during shipment."
"iPhone 11","Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy."
"iPhone 11","I love my iPhone when I got it there was nothing wrong with it no scratches no cracks or dents and most importantly no water damage everything works fine"
"iPhone 11","The phone looked like new, not even a scratch. And it works a treat. Synergy Smartphones rock!"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in acceptable shape. There was a light scuff on the upper left of the screen, but placing screen protector on it caused it not to be seen. I was able to transfer data from my Android phone, but when testing a phone call was unable to hear the person whom I called, even with the volume set all the way up. The speaker box had normal sound. I requested a return and the vendor is cooperating."
"iPhone 11","Most of the phone worked, but without it not reading my SIM card, it's useless, and a very expensive paper weight. I took the phone to AT&T and they confirmed by trying two brand new SIM cards that it was indeed the phone and not the card."
"iPhone 11","When I received the phone, it was filthy! The speakers were full of dirt and grime and the whole phone looked like it had never been cleaned. It came with a phone screen protector and when I went to peel it off (as I had ordered a new one) it was super gummy and the phone was covered in glue. This phone was NOT cleaned by amazon as promised and the phone screen was very scratched up. I cleaned it myself and the scratches are not too noticeable once I put the new screen protector on it. The phone works fine but it was a bummer to receive it not in the condition that was promised."
"iPhone 11","I purchased this phone and received it damaged, the speaker was very messed up. So i asked for help and they sent me a new one free of charge and told me to dispose of the first one so I did. All was well and customer service was amazing. After a month of waiting (I‚Äôm a prime member, I shouldn‚Äôt have had to wait that long), I received the phone and it had already been used!!! The phone had a password on it and other settings on it!! I immediately contacted amazon and the people I spoke to were extremely rude and didn‚Äôt give very much help, they were very hard to understand aswell. I finally was able to just get a refund, but they expected me to ship them this phone back! That is not my job, I‚Äôm not paying to ship this thing back! And now I don‚Äôt even have a phone that I‚Äôm in very much need of. Very disappointing."
"iPhone 11","It has turned out to be a great phone, Colorado, all settings very responsive and good battery life."
"iPhone 11","Thank you so much I love my new iPhone everything is working well no problems üòÅ"
"iPhone 11","We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them"
"iPhone 11","Amazing"
"iPhone 11","It works great"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 It doesn‚Äôt have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it‚Äôs a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it"
"iPhone 11"," It doesn‚Äôt have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it‚Äôs a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it"
"iPhone 11","So far so good"
"iPhone 11","La mejor decisi√≥n, el celular estaba como nuevo f√≠sica y internamente la bater√≠a 100%, y todo funciona a la perfecci√≥n."
"iPhone 11","It's a good phone lots of features and functions don't think it's worth the price tho."
"iPhone 11","Please stop false advertising to get sales if it‚Äôs not truly unlocked just say that now my little sister has to pay to get her phone unlocked. But other than that her phone came in good condition so I only knocked off two stars."
"iPhone 11","Happy with the product except for the fact that I came with a battery health of 88%. I know they only guarantee a minimum health of 80%, but of all the refurbished phones I‚Äôve gotten in the past, this one is the lowest health I‚Äôve ever seen. All my others have been around 95-97%. It kind of sucks to get a new-to-me phone and know I‚Äôm going to have to drop more money on a new battery soon"
"iPhone 11","El celular vino en excelentes condiciones f√≠sicas, lo √∫nico que me desmotiva es el nivel de la bater√≠a, vino en 83% sin embargo ten√≠a claro que hab√≠a una gran posibilidad de que llegara con ese por ciento, ya que lo indica las caracter√≠sticas; fuera de eso estoy muy contenta con la compra y el art√≠culo"
"iPhone 11","Works well‚Ä¶worth every penny and more."
"iPhone 11","I was a little skeptical at first cause of the price but this phone cause 4 days early and the batter was at 95%! No scratches or anything practically looked brand new."
"iPhone 11","The front-facing camera looked scratched and any photos taken with the front camera were very fuzzy and out of focus. The face ID recognition didn't work either. The rest of the phone seemed to work fine, but I was very disappointed by the front camera quality and returned it immediately."
"iPhone 11","Works great so far! Came in the next day. Really happy with the phone ! I will definitely recommend to anyone !!"
"iPhone 11","Better than i thought was pretty scared at first but yes!!! NOT A SCAMMMM also i have 87% battery couldve been better but okkkkk"
"iPhone 11","Buen equipo como nuevo sin detalles trajo protector de pantalla bater√≠a en buen estado y Face ID funcional"
"iPhone 11","I didn't get the refund. The cellphone always shut down for no reason."
"iPhone 11","It was time for an upgrade and this phone fits my needs."
"iPhone 11","I had the iphone 7 that started to show signs of failure. I wanted a bigger screen and an upgraded camera but didn't want to pay the $1000 plus dollars for it. I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes."
"iPhone 11","arrived quickly and working perfectly"
"iPhone 11","Great replacement phone. I always shop through Amazon before going to an actual phone store"
"iPhone 11","Screen was popping out"
"iPhone 11","El micr√≥fono no funciona bien. Las grabaciones quedan con un ruido. Es necesario utilizar manos libres."
"iPhone 11","Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm always a bit skeptical when buying electronics online, but I‚Äôm overall happy with my purchase! Purchase the iphone unlocked, it arrived unlocked. Just popped my SIM card in and had no problems. Obviously it‚Äôs refurbished, but it seemed like new. Just had a few scratches on the front and back (not really noticeable unless you look for them) and the battery health was at 91%."
"iPhone 11","Was super scared at first but glad I took a chance"
"iPhone 11","The Battery is sooo good the phone is little new to me so im still working with it but everything else is beautiful I love it and it was unlocked im happy with my product ."
"iPhone 11","I was given a nice phone, it would be amazing, but it is not unlocked for AT&T. The phone says 'SIM not Supported' when it tries to activate with an AT&T SIM working in a current AT&T plan phone. I've tried two of my AT&T SIMs now.

My AT&T SIM will not activate so I cannot use the phone, it might as well be a brick right now.. I've bought several other iPhones from this merchant that worked right away with my other AT&T SIMS, but they did not setup this one properly to activate with AT&T.

Please contact me on how to fix your product so I can activate my SIM, or send me a replacement ASAP."
"iPhone 11","Haven‚Äôt noticed anything wrong with phone in 3 months so far, battery seems brand new and camera looks good. A lot of space for cheap too. Mine started by charging really slow but I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that because the phone was probably powered off for awhile. Also I would buy a better charger this comes with a generic charger and with no phone box."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","Everything seems to be working perfectly fine, no cracks, or damage to the phone when delivered, and everything was just the way I wanted it to seem"
"iPhone 11","Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping! I was kinda bummed it came with only 89% battery life-I‚Äôm jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack. Love the facial recognition-wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea."
"iPhone 11","Phone was perfect.. thank you"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs ok."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in perfect condition! Works great, was 100% unlocked. The only downside would be the settings say it can only charge to 84%. So that kind of stinks. But other than that, not bad!"
"iPhone 11","I've tried new keyboards nothing will work. Part of the keys on keyboard doesn't work."
"iPhone 11","The batter came with 86% capacity. Everything else is excellent."
"iPhone 11","an expensive feeling phone for an inexpensive price"
"iPhone 11","My teen daughter loves this phone!!"
"iPhone 11","Got it for a great price I can‚Äôt tell at all it was pre owned"
"iPhone 11","Phone came like new from apple‚Ä¶.perfect condition!"
"iPhone 11","Overall, it was good, but it had a corner that was scratched up. Other than that, it is a pretty good device."
"iPhone 11","Very good condition and an excellent price!! Not a mark on it and will definitely purchase again"
"iPhone 11","Nice iphone just a battery health on 75% but so far all good"
"iPhone 11","Acceptable performance for the price. Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids."
"iPhone 11","This phone battery life is great, the phone is fast and responsive couldn‚Äôt be happier."
"iPhone 11","I have been going back and fourth about whether or not I should return this phone. I did my research and the 11 seemed like the best, affordable upgrade from my 8 plus. That being said, when it arrived today it was in less than ""excellent"" condition. For starters, the screen was pretty scratched when I looked at it under light. This doesn't show up when the phone and display are on, but it definitely worried me. In addition, the packaging was pretty sloppy and just came in a plastic sleeve in a cardboard box. That being said, the max capacity of battery is actually still 100% which is why I think I will still keep the phone. Buy with caution!"
"iPhone 11","Ordered the 11 because I needed a new phone and without a doubt this was the best price for one.Shipped pretty fast and when it arrived it didn‚Äôt come in normal Apple packaging which I expected.Phone works perfectly but main complaint I had was the battery life wasn‚Äôt at 100, not too big of a deal, another complaint was there was a screen protector put on but it was pretty poorly installed doesn‚Äôt really effect anything just a little annoying.Personally I would recommend you to buy this as the phone came in amazing basically new condition and with the price I really can‚Äôt complain."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didn‚Äôt know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering it‚Äôs refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasn‚Äôt too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future."
"iPhone 11","My phone had %90 battery health and came with a screen protector. It's looking good so far. Recommended!"
"iPhone 11","I am satisfied with this product, it also comes with a charger and screen protector. Just a minor scratch noticed on the screen."
"iPhone 11","I bought this iphone 11 as a replacement/upgrade. It was unlocked and clean. No complaints whatsoever. It works and looks like a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11","Phone in perfect conditions!! Very happy with my new phone."
"iPhone 11","Todo genial. Igual que nuevo. Liberado para Costa Rica."
"iPhone 11","So it works, it's a phone, it texts and calls and takes pictures and goes on the internet. But it's pretty glitchy and slow and the screen broke right away so I couldn't return it. Also came with a big weird glob of glue on the flash. Anyway you get what you pay for and I'm not wholly unsatisfied. The last refurbished iphone I got worked great and lasted years so it is what it is. I just hope the condition doesn't further deteriorate over time."
"iPhone 11","I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone"
"iPhone 11","El √∫nico detalle fue unos rayones pero son peque√±os de ah√≠ en mas el dispositivo es una maravilla"
"iPhone 11","So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!"
"iPhone 11","It looks like new. No scratches. Battery health 89%."
"iPhone 11","Disappointed with product. The volume sounds poor and 24hrs after using it message notified me battery needs replacing . I priced battery it will be another 100.00. The poor reviews this seller has is very true . I will likely switch my services back to my old phone and return the I -11. Very disappointed"
"iPhone 11","The phone was in great shape but Boost Mobile would not recognize the IMEI number, so it had to be returned. Return process was very easy."
"iPhone 11","This phone is one of the best."
"iPhone 11","faulty speaker"
"iPhone 11","Works well so far minor cracks but activation was very easy and not that long."
"iPhone 11","I simply love this phone. I would have gave the finger print reader 5 stars but it does not have it"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in good condition"
"iPhone 11","This isn‚Äôt worth the price tbh. Battery don‚Äôt last and phone screen scratched"
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs okay to have condition was okay only a single issue is that when you‚Äôre on a phone call the other person can‚Äôt hear you well unless you‚Äôre using an earphone/airpods"
"iPhone 11","Producto en excelentes condiciones fisicas, con un mes de garant√≠a, bater√≠a al 99%, sin rayones, c√°mara y pantalla en excelente estado. Imei original, totalmente desbloqueado y funcional para las redes m√≥viles en Colombia. Caja y cargador gen√©rico marca LG, cable lightnin apple y entrega en el tiempo estimado, incluso un d√≠a antes de lo previsto. En general, muy buena experiencia de compra."
"iPhone 11","Business"
"iPhone 11","This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more."
"iPhone 11","I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to switch to apple from Android. Phone came in with a few scratches on the body and the battery was at 87%, so it was in pretty good condition. Only returned it because iOS isn't my thing. Comes with a SIM tool and a 10W generic charger. I think the phone is supposed to come with 18W, but it's a good backup charger."
"iPhone 11","Todo perfecto"
"iPhone 11","This was a very good purchase and the seller met our expectation."
"iPhone 11","Everything is perfect. Like a brand new. Great purchase."
"iPhone 11","Muy bueno si por desir exelente bien protegido yedo dos dias antes no tube problema con el rastre enfin bolveria a comprar otro con este vendedor tenia dudas por nocer distribuido por Amazon pero wow muy bien lo isieron"
"iPhone 11","The only thing wrong with it is that there is a crack in one of the camera lenses.Otherwise it looked practically new. It came with a case, a screen protector, a tool to open the sim card, and an off brand charging cable. Overall it was a great deal."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs a refurbished phone I don‚Äôt mind that it didn‚Äôt come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it‚Äôs my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it‚Äôll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend"
"iPhone 11","I was hesitant about buying this but I definitely recommend! They phone came with a screen protector already on it, and a charger as well. It‚Äôs been fantastic! There were no scratches or dents. It is in really good condition and I‚Äôm super happy I made this purchase."
"iPhone 11","Nice color, good outer condition but the phone screens shuts down while your on a call and makes it difficult to end the phone call, screen just keeps flickering and there‚Äôs nothing you can do but wait. audio also sometime goes in and out and makes it hard to hear on video calls too. Not enjoyable at all."
"iPhone 11","Works and looks like new. Battery seems new. Much cheaper than a new iPhone."
"iPhone 11","The description said it will come in a white boxThe item came in a plastic bag !!!NO BOX"
"iPhone 11","Arrived with a deep scratch on the screen"
"iPhone 11","It is not functioning I will be returning"
"iPhone 11","I normally don‚Äôt write reviews but I had to honest best phone I ever brought and I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not new"
"iPhone 11","DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE BOOST OR SPRINT, but other than that the phone works perfect it looks brand new I deff recommend"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in very good condition. All was as advertised."
"iPhone 11","Great phone to buy, small scratches but not noticeable. Came with 100% battery life."
"iPhone 11","It doesn't come with 80percent battery but it was in fantastic shape I would üíØ recommend"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in folded fedex bag inside of a box the same size of the phone, wrapped in bubble wrap. Not the worst packaging, but was a tad worried about integrity of phone. So put that into consideration if you want to. Phone had 100% battery life, setup and SIM card transfer was instant and easy. Great and snappy phone, was worth buying a refurbished version. Only thing I can truly complain about is that when I took off the provided screen protector off to put an expensive one I bought there were very visible scratches all over the screen. Other than that, if you‚Äôre into saving about $400 and don‚Äôt mind a refurbished product, this phone is for you."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs just difficult too read due to it‚Äôs size. I have to turn it sideways in Oder to read and accurately type."
"iPhone 11","Arrived on time, and looked like new."
"iPhone 11","la c√°mara es muy buena, saca fotos con muy poca luz."
"iPhone 11","At first I was like ehhh I hope this works. Got it as a gift for my boyfriend. The price was great and everywhere else was sold out. We were able to get it all set up with no issues. After a few months, it‚Äôs still working just fine."
"iPhone 11","Face recognition is great"
"iPhone 11","The phone seemed great! But the battery just wouldn‚Äôt stay charged and took a long time to get charged. We took it in to replace the battery and they encouraged us to trade phones. But Amazon was fabulous to work with and we would definitely buy a phone from them again in the future."
"iPhone 11","The phone was not cleaned I was moving dirt from around the camera area."
"iPhone 11","The phone is mediocre. It has scratches on the screen. And the internet just randomly stops working to where I have to restart the phone to get it to start working again. Other than that it is ok."
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived a day after I purchased it. Super fast! The phone is awesome and in excellent condition! Love it!"
"iPhone 11","I got the phone in an Amazon box, well packaged. I‚Äôve put my Nigerian sim which works well, so it‚Äôs fully unlocked. Battery life is 97% which is good. No scratches and phone perfectly works well. Looks like new and good buy"
"iPhone 11","Battery life is on 85% when I got this phone never had a renewed phone battery percentage be that low. I‚Äôm hoping that the battery will last me for a year or until i get a new phone"
"iPhone 11","üëç"
"iPhone 11","Phone looked new and worked a little over 4 months and then started getting real hot and cutting off within 5 mins of use. Battery swelled up and split the phone. Took it to a repair shop where we were notified that it was unfixable. The battery in it was not apple and was installed incorrectly therefore overheated and fried the circuit board and many other parts of the phone. Fingerprint and face recognition never worked also."
"iPhone 11","I just didn't like the battery"
"iPhone 11","All"
"iPhone 11","The good this about the phone is that is doesn‚Äôt looked used at all and works perfectly fine. The bad thing is it‚Äôs Black Listed and I can‚Äôt get it activated. The customer service isn‚Äôt the best either. Instead of them offering a new phone , they only offered a refund when all I wanted is for the to get the phone off the Black List. Won‚Äôt ever be purchasing anything from them again."
"iPhone 11","La verdad que al ser un telefono renovado pude recuperar toda la informacion de otro iphone lo que es genial aun no puedo hablar de la bateria lo estoy cargando, venia cin algunos raspones pero con una proteccion no se notaran, por el momento estoy feliz, dire algo mas cuando lo prube mas dias funciona muy bien en chile"
"iPhone 11","Item not used delivery date nor honored as advertised even after 2 attempts and long waiting time to answer my call and request"
"iPhone 11","After about two months of use, the screen started moving by itself while also not registering my touch. It got to the point where the ghost touches were so bad, the phone clicked itself into light mode (I use dark mode) and if I wasn‚Äôt careful, would reply gibberish to text messages. I couldn‚Äôt use the keyboard at all. Using the screen in any capacity quickly became impossible. I brought my phone to a few repair shops, none of which could help, some even accusing the seller to have replaced some of the inner parts with lesser quality ones. None of the employees could even get the phone into diagnostic mode as the screen kept glitching out. A refurbished phone should last more than two months, especially considering this one cost nearly four hundred dollars.Amazon allowed me to return the iPhone by August 31st"
"iPhone 11","Love this phoneVery cool featuresEven better price"
"iPhone 11","Todo funciona correctamente"
"iPhone 11","Complete trash. They only ‚Äúrefurbish‚Äù it well enough for it to likely work past the 90 day warranty and then it craps out. We didn‚Äôt drop the phone, it didn‚Äôt get wet. Nothing. No cracks, dents- nothing from us and the screen all of a sudden starting going out. Just a huge black line across the screen, and the longer you leave the phone on- the more black lines appear until the screen is completely black. The phone is completely unusable and it‚Äôs clearly an eternal issue. I messaged the seller and they were totally unreasonable and unhelpful. Fasted $400+ dollars I‚Äôve ever wasted, for sure."
"iPhone 11","The item has very visible damage on the lower edge of the body and is not in excellent condition. I'm returning it and have already ordered another one with the hope that the new one is really ok."
"iPhone 11","No"
"iPhone 11","The phone came in like brand new. I‚Äôve been using it for over a month now and it works like brand new. It‚Äôs definitely worth the money, and exceeded my expectations. There were no visible or harsh scratches or damage to it when it arrived, and compared to my iPhone 6, the battery life is long. There are plenty of reasons to buy a refurbished phone; money saving and reusing is one of them. I‚Äôd say go for it if you really want to."
"iPhone 11","So far so good still trying to learn the features on the phone but no issues phone came packaged well Thanks guys"
"iPhone 11","As someone who solely lives off service industry tips buying a new phone was super risky. I took the chance on buying a refurbished phone and it was my best financial decision I‚Äôve made :) It‚Äôs practically brand new"
"iPhone 11","I like the phone overall, but I wish it wouldn‚Äôt die 24/7"
"iPhone 11","more than happy with this phone, it exceeded my expectations"
"iPhone 11","What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new."
"iPhone 11","Great buy"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in perfect condition! I was worried because I‚Äôve never bought a used phone before. Very happy with the purchase. Have had phone for several months now and still great."
"iPhone 11","The phone came with 81% battery life and it worked totally fine, but the charger it came with didn't work.Update: I did 15.6 IOS update and it went down to 79%"
"iPhone 11","The phone came with a protection screen and great phone. Came fast and included a charger ."
"iPhone 11","Cons: degraded batter life (not renewed or refurbished)Pros: cosmetically perfect, in working condition, screen protector. The only factors saving it from a much harsher review."
"iPhone 11","Not a phone slave so after two days still have 48% battery."
"iPhone 11","You can‚Äôt transfer old iPhone to this you have to start it as a brand new but as long as your cloud is backed up you should be straight"
"iPhone 11","Love the phone, brand new conditions, I didn‚Äôt see any problems. Great battery life. Like I can be on 1% and still use my phone no problems. Came quickly. I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. I‚Äôve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if that‚Äôs a phone issue or a gmail issue."
"iPhone 11","Multiple nicks on the case around the screen, leading me to believe the phone has had a hard life. Not protected with a case of a screen protector. Scratches and blemishes on screen as well as the back . Seems to function decently. First thing I did was put on a case and screen. I‚Äôm not convinced of the 80% battery life , After a low usage day it needs charging.I‚Äôm on the fence . Can‚Äôt send a picture of the phone due to , well you know taking a pic of it is impossible"
"iPhone 11","Very good, No cracks or anything visible. Def recommend"
"iPhone 11","Phone was unlocked and work perfect"
"iPhone 11","Arrived as perfect condition and works as new. Very pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 11","Came in perfect condition pretty much brand new works perfect"
"iPhone 11","I am really happy with this purchase it feels like a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11","The refurbished I iPhone 11 I bought stopped getting service three months after I bought it. I contacted my carrier and was told that the original owner had marked the phone as stolen and the phone had been black-listed by the original carrier. Now I have a phone that has no practical function ( can't get service) and the seller has not responded to my request for a replacement."
"iPhone 11","We have had no negative issues with our iphone 11. Works great."
"iPhone 11","Good item and in a very good condition"
"iPhone 11","No llego como deb√≠a estaba golpeado en l parte inferior y lo devolv√≠Por el precio puse un poco m√°s y compr√© nuevo"
"iPhone 11","Very pleased with my new to me phone"
"iPhone 11","This is the best experience I‚Äôve had with a renewed phone, it comes in anothee box and another charger (I was expecting to buy the fast charge anyways) it comes with a 96% of battery health and just ONE scratch on the back but it is really small, it comes unlocked (or at least you can use it with metro by t-mobile) definitely recommend! Great product! <3"
"iPhone 11","First off I would like to say the phone did work it did fully charged and overall cosmetics was excellent. However I bought this phone because my wife iPhone XR was causing her problems, I bought an unlocked phone so I didn't have to deal with locked GSM. The reader didn't even pick up her SIM card. The phone did not work at all as far as connecting to carrier. I will never buy from this seller again. It could have been just a freak accident however it was a humongous inconvenience."
"iPhone 11","The phone looked brand new and the battery health came at 100% which i was very surprised by, but overall it was worth the price. I would definitely buy from this seller again"
"iPhone 11","At first I was kinda iffy about getting it cause I saw some people said that theirs weren‚Äôt unlocked, or it was scratched up, or the sound was bad, but my looks brand new, the sound is great it‚Äôs fully unlocked and the battery life is great"
"iPhone 11","Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact, I may just be ready to migrate to the ""dark side"" and go get a Pixel 6 next!"
"iPhone 11","El dispositivo llego en una caja de restauracion de amazon, tiene todas las funciones perfectas y estaba liberado para ser usado con cualquiera telefonica a nivel mundial recomiendo comprar estos dispositivos restaurados por amazon."
"iPhone 11","Battery good,When I did insert the SIM card immediately workGood"
"iPhone 11","Work perfectly fine"
"iPhone 11","We were worried but honestly it is so working GREAT. Even the transfer of all our apps, Contacts, Notes, etc were VERY easy to transfer.So far so good."
"iPhone 11","All was good"
"iPhone 11","Works very well ,"
"iPhone 11","I bought it for my 17 year old. He seems to like it ok. But of course he wanted a brand new model. He is spoiled that way."
"iPhone 11","Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after"
"iPhone 11","Literally, the biggest waste of money I've ever received from Amazon. I purchased this phone three weeks ago and it doesn't work. I've been on help with Apple for hours and they can't seem to fix it without sending it into the factory, costing me hundreds of dollars. Had I known the phone I purchased from AMAZON would have been such a problem, I would have gone directly to the Apple Store and saved myself a HUGE headache and a lot of time. BUYER BEWARE...seriously, the phones they sell here are junk and MIGHT get one that works, and then again, you might spend HUNDREDS of dollars to wind up with something that doesn't work and you'll end up sending it to apple to get repaired. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"iPhone 11","I like that it was here a day early, it scared me when the touch screen didn‚Äôt work at first, then by magic it started working when I said I was going to take it back. Been working since then."
"iPhone 11","I love it. Ordered yesterday and it was delivered today which is one day earlier than it was suppose to come. Everything is in perfect condition and it worked with metro. I had 0 issues. Switched from iPhone 8 Plus. I was very hesitant on buying because of some of the reviews saying it wasn‚Äôt fully unlocked. but I‚Äôm glad I bought it. üôÉ"
"iPhone 11","The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery. DO NOT BUY."
"iPhone 11","The screen partly damaged but everything else is fine."
"iPhone 11","The phone was in excellent condition, not a scratch. Also after shopping around I got it for the absolute est price!"
"iPhone 11","I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That‚Äôs a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It‚Äôs also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff was eAsy."
"iPhone 11","okay i got this phone and it came in my buildings amazon hub,, my the battery 10/10 LONG LASTING, the condition of the phone is really good no cracks, it comes with a screen protector, everything about this phone is amazing."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in great condition but upon setting it up, I encountered some errors first the Face ID was working but when tilting my face wasn‚Äôt detecting anything, ear speaker wasn‚Äôt working and phone battery health was 89% and when playing Call of duty mobile the device will lag while my Ac unit is chilling cold."
"iPhone 11","Except for the unboxing experience (Plain white box) the phone is BRAND NEW. I couldn't believe it. No scratches or scuffs a screen protector and charger 100 % battery. It in Product Red. I'm VERY satisfied."
"iPhone 11","Can‚Äôt even download the update to use it cuz battery was at 20% other than that it‚Äôs great"
"iPhone 11","Por fuera est√° muy bien, unos peque√±os rayones que no se notan si no te fijas bien, funciona bien, la bater√≠a tienen buen rendimiento y carga r√°pido dependiendo con qu√© cargador lo pongas, fsce ID super r√°pido, todo est√° s√∫per bien por ahora, el UNICO PROBLEMA ES que no me aparece en ajustes WALLET Y APPLE PAY O PASSBOOK Y APPLE PAY , no me da la opci√≥n de descargarlo y parece un tel√©fonos no falso gracias a eso, ahora me resulta dif√≠cil pq no puedo tomar el tren y pagar con mi tel√©fono o pagar en tiendas de manera electr√≥nica, QUIERO UN REEMBOLSO, NO PAGUE TANTO DINERO POR ESTO"
"iPhone 11","I haven‚Äôt owned an iPhone since the first generation. I‚Äôve been an android baby for years since then. That said, they‚Äôve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but it‚Äôs definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from."
"iPhone 11","This phone came with a non-Apple charger and power adapter which might be different and possibly not good for the phone. I would have preferred an Apple charger and power adapter."
"iPhone 11","Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but you‚Äôre unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but don‚Äôt expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that‚Äôs not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldn‚Äôt have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away"
"iPhone 11","Had to contact Apple support because it apparently had multiple Apple IDs on the same device before, so set up was a bit lame, but once i got in, it was smooth as hell. Still can‚Äôt believe I got it at such good price. And it even came with a screen protector!"
"iPhone 11","Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)"
"iPhone 11","Phone looked and worked like a new one. Battery life was at 85%. Very pleased with my purchase."
"iPhone 11","Vida √∫til de la bater√≠a era de 91%.Pantalla con leves rayas y un desgaste en una esquina inferior trasera."
"iPhone 11","This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope."
"iPhone 11","This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers. The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better c√°mara and all new features. I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it. Really happy with it. Thank you."
"iPhone 11","I was a bit scared getting this at first but when it arrived, it was in very good condition and I was able to add the phone to my plan on the same day!!"
"iPhone 11","I recently made the switch from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to the IPhone 11 and the phone arrived fast looking practically brand new. No scratches or blemishes. Maximum battery capacity is 85% but this phone holds a charge pretty good. I've had the phone for a month now with no issues. This is my 2nd purchase from this seller and I will buy again in the future."
"iPhone 11","This was a ""refurbished"" iPhone 11. The packaging was fine, professionally packed with all the included items as described. It had 81% battery life, also as described. However, as I was setting this phone up for my wife, I discovered the screen had been replaced with an ""unauthorized"" screen. As I was prepared to explain to my wife that the the ""big red balloon"" with the number 1 in setting was just fine, the phone locked up and would not restart, including a full reboot of the system. Returned to the seller the same day. Let's see if I get a refund properly."
"iPhone 11","The phone looks and works great the only bad part is that the battery came with a 85% of battery life, not 100% as I would have expected‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11","Me agrado lo que compr√©. :)"
"iPhone 11","Ten√≠a m√°s expectativas, xq al momento de realizar la compra indicaba q estaba en muy buenas condiciones, es decir me decid√≠ xq el q me costaba un poco m√°s a otra opci√≥n q hab√≠a visto mas econ√≥mica pero bas√°ndome en lo q le√≠ q dec√≠a q estaba en Perfecto yo estado, resulta q al RECIBIRLO EL CELULAR TIENE UN GOLPE Q ES MUY EVIDENTE, EST√Å PICADO DE UN LADO ‚Ä¶la verdad no llen√≥ mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11","I gave this to my nephew and he loved it"
"iPhone 11","Picture"
"iPhone 11","I only have one complaint and its the speakers. They are incredibly quiet and crack a lot, will update when I return and get a new one with how it performs."
"iPhone 11","Phone was as expected 100/100"
"iPhone 11","The phone itself looks like it was dropped a few times. Scratch is all over it scratched on the back. It's not refurbished like it comes from a recognized company. It's refurbished like it came from a friend that had it for a few years and decided to give it away because of how scratched up it has come. It is not working now and I'm about to send it back. The thing stopped turning on completely after putting a $80 case on it. Never dropping it. It practically never leaves my computer desk and still is having problems working. I don't understand this"
"iPhone 11","I only had one problem. . . WHY DID I GET A BAND NEW DEVICE! I activated it in minutes, No issues and the best part their is no scratches or marks I was regretting my purchase because of all the negative reviews but man am blown away with this device fits better then all my previous Plus max devices"
"iPhone 11","This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most."
"iPhone 11","Awesome phone like new"
"iPhone 11","Great ph for the right price"
"iPhone 11","The I phone works great & our granddaughter loves it."
"iPhone 11","I didn't like that the phone arrived in unusable condition. Tried for several hours to follow instructions but had to give up. Phone does not start up, only displays an intermittent flashing apple logo when plugged in to a charger, and responds ""cannot restore your iphone due to an unknown error"" when attempting to restore the software with my mac. This could only have slipped past the inspection if the tech was asleep..."
"iPhone 11","I bought this used phone for my daughter. It was in perfect condition. She loves it. Her favorite color rven."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can‚Äôt see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it‚Äôs gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it‚Äôs good I guess it doesn‚Äôt have YouTube but I‚Äôm satisfied I guess but, the price should‚Äôve been lower than this since it‚Äôs refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins."
"iPhone 11","El celular vino impecable, con mica, nuevo, sin rayones, bater√≠a 100%. Lo compr√© en EEUU y lo traje a Ecuador, funciona de maravilla. Es la mejor compra que he hecho en a√±os en amazon, pero ojo!!! Comprenlo con BuySPRY, de este proveedor ya hab√≠a le√≠do rese√±as excelentes y no me fall√≥, qu√© excelente servicio."
"iPhone 11","camara has a vibrating motion pictures, and videos are blurry"
"iPhone 11","I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews. It came with a very small scratch on the screen that was hard to see unless you really looked. That has been the only thing that was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with the phone. Other than that, the phone has worked amazing, great battery life, awesome camera, and no hiccups on how it works."
"iPhone 11","Not only is the color so pretty on the phone the face recognition is so fast and the battery life is amazing. Definitely worth the spend, not a scratch or ding on this phone. And it came a day early!"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn‚Äôt come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone don‚Äôt let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I‚Äôm paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"

"iPhone 11","Phone to small"
"iPhone 11","I honestly thought this may have been a scam but it wasn‚Äôt and the package even came early. Everything works great and the battery life is 94%. The only minor thing is when I got the phone, it was on 2%. But I charged it and it was fine."
"iPhone 11","You Might be skeptical of getting a renewed phone, but so far mine has had no noticeable issues or differences from a brand new one. Even physically, it was flawless; no scratches on the screen or dents or anythin. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, I basically got a new IPhone for 100 dollars off so I‚Äôm pretty happy with it."
"iPhone 11","I had the phone for about a week and started noticing some issues with the Wi-Fi but would just reset my phone. One day the phone wouldn't let any calls or texts go through I ended up having to go to my phone carrier and see if they could help me and they got it working for a good 5-10min and the it went right back to not doing anything staying that there was no signal. I couldn't get onto any of my apps because there was no connection but when I went into the network settings, it said it was connected to the Wi-Fi. I'm very unclear about the issue but now I have to deal with sending it back to amazon and waiting to purchase the same kind through my phone carrier. I had bought an iPhone 7 off of Amazon and it works great still!"
"iPhone 11","It like that everything was nice on the phone"
"iPhone 11","I love everything about this product and I‚Äôm not just saying that like I‚Äôm an apple fanboy it‚Äôs a really good phone great features and so on siri annoys me cause she chimes in for no reason but that‚Äôs always a thing over all it was well worth it ."
"iPhone 11","Todo de acuerdo a lo detallado en la publicaci√≥n"
"iPhone 11","Phone came looking like it just left the apple factory, 100% battery life everything works perfectly excellent purchase"
"iPhone 11","Producto en excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11","Exelente"
"iPhone 11","Bought what I thought would be a ""like new"" phone for well over $400, and it has spots all over the screen as if the LED lights have been damaged. I went to return it, and it says the phone is not eligible for refunds."
"iPhone 11","I really love this phone! I was really nervous about it at first, but it came in really fast so not too much time to worry! When it arrived it was in perfect condition except for a lil bit of scuff marks in the top corner ( apply a lil dab of toothpaste and they become less noticeable! ) so I‚Äôm very, very happy with my purchase!"
"iPhone 11","Loved the product"
"iPhone 11","Listen hardware wise it‚Äôs okay. Some missing chips in paint and a lot of little scratches from an angle hopefully it doesn‚Äôt cause too much trouble when the screen protector comes in(will update later). Software I don‚Äôt see any problems so far but will edit if there comes an issue!"
"iPhone 11","Battery life sucks but other than that it‚Äôs a alright phone the 6 is better"
"iPhone 11","Las llamadas no salen ni entran y cuando escrib√≠a en la pantalla hab√≠a que hacerle mucha presi√≥n o con mucha fuerza con el dedo para poder escribir."
"iPhone 11","I like that I can play Brawlhalla"
"iPhone 11","I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.

Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There‚Äôs also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.

I‚Äôm incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
"iPhone 11","Eh. In my opinion, it‚Äôs just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, it‚Äôs got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. I‚Äôm still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright..."
"iPhone 11","I don't like it, I brought the screen a little off"
"iPhone 11","I can‚Äôt believe I waited so long to purchase it!!"
"iPhone 11","Battery said 80% minimum and I got less paid for excellent condition and got acceptable. A bunch of scratches visible. While I was setting it up the phone had already gotten extremely hot after only doing the set up for the iPhone which didn‚Äôt even take long."
"iPhone 11","I dislike no availability of hotspot"
"iPhone 11","Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.

If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't."
"iPhone 11","Don‚Äôt trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word. Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I‚Äôve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.

I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly."
"iPhone 11","Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far it‚Äôs good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes I‚Äôll update my review."
"iPhone 11","Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol)."
"iPhone 11","My children very glad this phone )"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in excellent condition. Battery was nearly completed charged and there weren‚Äôt any scratches on the screen. The phone was ready to be set up and was fully unlocked so I could use my old SIM. It also came with a screen protector on it which was a nice touch."
"iPhone 11","I've had the phone for about 16 hours. Nothing but trouble right from the start. It keeps restarting itself and shutting the screen off randomly. I spent over an hour troubleshooting with Apple. They said that it's probably bad software. I'm sure iPhone 11s are great, just don't waste your money buying it from Amazon. Buy refurbished directly from Apple. That way you have options if it doesn't work (other than wasting your time returning it.)"
"iPhone 11","Excellent"
"iPhone 11","Very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11","Great condition"
"iPhone 11","Muy buena compra ü§©"
"iPhone 11","The best phone for the BEST price, BuySpry really did it again. Second time buying from them and honestly they did not disappoint. Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here."
"iPhone 11","That‚Äôs it"
"iPhone 11","Everything is okay üëçüèº"
"iPhone 11","Arrived sooner than expected. Cosmetic looks new. Adding to existing account went well."
"iPhone 11","Perfect"
"iPhone 11","Para mi huso personal"
"iPhone 11","Needed to upgrade my phone and this is the ticket--I'm still learning and so far I have no complaints!!!!"
"iPhone 11","Great phone practically brand new took forever to come though but hey 100% battery health. Four stars because you spend $600 you expect your package to be here took 14 days though."
"iPhone 11","I have ordered phones twice from this seller and they consecutively send phones with low battery health. one device was 75% and the other 77%. I find this to be very dishonest because i even messaged the seller privately before the order was shipped to confirm that the battery Healths would be 80 or above and sameeeeeee result. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND! returning both phones!!!"
"iPhone 11","Fast shipping works just like new no scratches or anything in particular so far so good,I recently bought (2) from different sellers and I had to send it back within days.,fingers cross I would recommend it to anyone who has problems like me in the past with others sellers this renewed are basically new ones üëç"
"iPhone 11","La pantalla ten√≠a demasiados rayones"
"iPhone 11","Like new iPhone 11."
"iPhone 11","Private use. It‚Äôs easy to use."
"iPhone 11","I bought this as a gift as it said it was unlocked . My sister couldn‚Äôt connect it and took it to an Apple Store and they said they couldn‚Äôt help because it was locked. And I returned it and didn‚Äôt get my money back."
"iPhone 11","It messes up all the time glitches and apps disappear and it cuts on and off repeatedly . Definitely not worth the money I regret my purchase"
"iPhone 11","I can not coment on the actual performance, except to say that If you are an Apple user this is a good choice. My friend did not like the xr. This one has huge storage capacity, retina display, and there are plenty of accessory items available."
"iPhone 11","Love it, phone work on good condition!! EVERYTHING work totally fine, and it actually came WAYYYY faster then it was supposed to"
"iPhone 11","Excellent condition physically and operationally and even had glass screen protectors still installed and without a blemish"
"iPhone 11","Muy mala.calida la bater√≠a esta en un porcentaje bajo y el sonido es muy mal"
"iPhone 11","The phone appeared to operate just fine other than the fact that the speakers were either blown or there was a bad soundboard, because all of the audio coming out of the speakers was distorted and sounded terrible, phone calls on speaker up to the ear, tried watching something on YouTube that was distorted as well. I am not happy at all. I didn‚Äôt realize the phone had this issue until after I had put in all of my information and began downloading a software update and then everything from iCloud‚Ä¶ wasted hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back because they sent me a phone that doesn‚Äôt play sound properly. Sucks. I am ordering another one and I will update my review.

Update: I decided to go with the iPhone 11 Pro in badass army green, because it was only $400 (however, the seller immediately upped price $40 after my purchase). I will post my review on that specific page as it doesn‚Äôt make sense to post here."
"iPhone 11","Screen has a few scratches as stated in listing. Battery life is 96%. For the money, it could have been sent with a Apple charger and some ear buds. But so far it works like it should. I‚Äôd buy again"
"iPhone 11","I received it before the predicted arrival time and everything works great!"
"iPhone 11","I personally didn‚Äôt have any issues when ordering this. It‚Äôs a great phone and I‚Äôm very happy with it. I have ordered phone from Amazon in the past and lucked out with them working properly. Ether Amazon is getting the better phones or I just got lucky with this one. I would recommend"
"iPhone 11","My first day of using this phone, and with half a battery, the phone just dies. Then I get a notification saying it‚Äôs not an ‚ÄúApple battery‚Äù so now my phone constantly has an error message and I never really know what the battery is at."
"iPhone 11","Happy with the phone so far only complaint is it arrived with scratches on screen face, since my screen protector kinda hides it , Is only reason i did not send it back"
"iPhone 11","Would no longer connect to Cell phone Carrier after 6 months. And was told the warranty was no longer valid. STEAR CLEAR OF ""AMAZON RENWED"" we paid way to much for it to not even last a year!"
"iPhone 11","As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but I‚Äôm so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!"
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived looking brand new. However the back camera is not working. I restarted the phone and it worked for short while, and then stopped working again. I recommend buying a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11","The charger that mine came with caught on fire, and burned a hole in my seat, the phone screen wasn‚Äôt apple and peeled off, and I tried getting a replacement but the buyer still isn‚Äôt getting back to me even after I already returned it. And I haven‚Äôt gotten a refund"
"iPhone 11","El celular est√° en buen estado, pero la vida de la bater√≠a no muy buena, estaba a un 93% cuando lo compramos y 1 mes despu√©s a 85%. Llego con un cargador de muy mala calidad, lo pusimos a cargar con este y luego de unos minutos el celular se empez√≥ a recalentar, lo dejamos de usar inmediatamente."
"iPhone 11","Honestly, if you buy it through amazon, it already comes unlocked, ready to use, and nothing changes about the phone's performance and its cheaper than buying it in the actual apple store (if paying for full price all at once)."
"iPhone 11","And you get 79% it‚Äôs a bummer. I know it‚Äôs only 1% difference, but I spent a lot of money. I researched. My old phone was a 6s, I‚Äôve had it for many years and the only thing wrong was the battery health was 82% and not holding a charge. I may return this if it does not hold a charge. I‚Äôve only had it one day. I will post update if it I have to return."
"iPhone 11","the phone was likes new"
"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono llego antes de lo esperado. Funciona bien todo, lo √∫nico que no me gusto es que la pantalla tiene dos rapaduras scratches"
"iPhone 11","Idk if it‚Äôs really worth it when I got mine the screen started glitching and I have like this light spot on the bottom and I also found out that the speaker was blown its sounds like someone farting when I play a song I would return but those things don‚Äôt bother me personally but it may be a deal breaker for someone else"
"iPhone 11","We got the phones early in excellent condition,we love everything about them so far no scratches nothing,phone's basically brand new.. two iphone 11 was purchased one for me n my sister ,would Definetly recommend any one to purchase from this seller..absolutely in love with our phones..No problems so far n the phone works well...TY so much."
"iPhone 11","Me llego en perfecto estado, casi no tiene defectos est√©ticos luce como nuevo, la bater√≠a le dura bastante, la verdad muy satisfecha con la compra."
"iPhone 11","Great So far Will buy another"
"iPhone 11","Battery dies early and Face ID barley worked. Within two weeks the phone over heated and screen popped out and it is not a real Apple display."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived on, but battery is in great condition. Phone looks like and functions like new. I have no complaints and am very happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 11","Muy bueno, hasta ahora todo excelente. todo funciona de maravilla"
"iPhone 11","Was shipped with battery health at 84%. Unfortunately it‚Äôs my first iPhone after life of Android so I didn‚Äôt catch that until after the 30 days warenry"
"iPhone 11","I was a little bit iffy about buying it but I did and when it came in I wasn‚Äôt disappointed, I love it I have never had an iPhone before and I am very happy"
"iPhone 11","It works fine but some times it go slow of the system, the phone looks ok no damage or anything, only thing you have to beware you might get a bad one I feel, you pay what you get !"
"iPhone 11","Great!!!"
"iPhone 11","Battery wasn‚Äôt replaced like I expected in a refurbished phone"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve bought the iPhone 11 waiting to get an excellent condition or like new as advertised. But it came in a poor condition with a lot of signs of use and a little dent on the screen. I‚Äôve returned the item and refunded without problems."
"iPhone 11","It had scratches on the screen so did not meet my exceptions"
"iPhone 11","The iPhone is ok, just the way it should work an iPhone 11 but, sadly, it has three really big scratches on the top of the screen. I thought about return it but I am from Venezuela and is a little bit expensive make that, so, now, I have a $600 phone with scratches on the screen... Well, at least work fine, it's unlocked."
"iPhone 11","Works good I‚Äôve had it for about a month and it works just like a new phone no problems out of it. Can‚Äôt even tell it‚Äôs refurbished has some small scratches on the back that aren‚Äôt noticeable but other than that it‚Äôs a good phone"
"iPhone 11","As if I went to the apple store and bought it straight from there, but cheaper for the storage. I‚Äôve had this phone for about 5 months now and all that I‚Äôve seen is it‚Äôs gets a bit hot if I use big apps, and it lags a bit if I have too many things opened. But it‚Äôs literally good."
"iPhone 11","MY daughter was elated when she received this for Christmas! Worked perfectly!"
"iPhone 11","I thought I was going to be lucky. Usually I ignore reviews, DONT IGNORE! This phone was not fully unlocked and it had stated it was even in the settings. It lied, spent too much money trying to get it fixed. Not worth it at all. I am very disappointed, hope to get my money back or any sort of compensation. Don't go through the tears and trials that I did. Very upset with this product wish it was better."
"iPhone 11","Love the color and the phone is almost like new. I ordered an XR before this and was not satisfied with its feature. Easy return and was able to purchase this one. Great quality. Great battery life. Great camera."
"iPhone 11","False advertising!
Please lookup this seller and read all bad reviews before making a purchase.
What a terrible experience (Lots of aggravation, wasted time, wasted money).
Please buy it at your local store or somewhere else. It's not worth it!"
"iPhone 11","It looks really new and perfect my daughter loved it."
"iPhone 11","Do not buy! The previous reviews go in depth with all this functions and mishaps I encounter with this phones exactly. I only had the phone a few hours before experience the iCloud issues and overall only kept the phone for 2 days. They did give my money back but everyone hasn‚Äôt been as lucky."
"iPhone 11","Funcionando de buena forma!"
"iPhone 11","The phone it‚Äôs self is good but it is a lie bout it being carrier unlocked"
"iPhone 11","Phone froze and could not be set up. Seller approved return but won't answer my email about when I will receive my refund."
"iPhone 11","The phone is good and in great condition but it is not fully unlocked"
"iPhone 11","The only issue I had with this phone is the inability to download new apps"
"iPhone 11","They said a minimum of 80% of battery health and I got 99% out the box which I love since it lasts all day. This is a value for your money since buying it on apple website, it‚Äôs $749 (for 256GB) while on here it‚Äôs $614 (depending on the color for 256GB)"
"iPhone 11","The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn‚Äôt updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I‚Äôve had it for a week now)

Update :

Phone really isn‚Äôt unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It‚Äôs it works only with cdma networks ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not happy"
"iPhone 11","Man this is great! Got this a couple months ago for me and and my girlfriend and they work great! Only problem was the chip for a boost mobile phone but you just have to ask for a new one and they will give it to you! Everything works fine and I recommend this! 10/10"
"iPhone 11","Thank you"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","So far so good! I needed to upgrade my phone for awhile and postponed. This was such a. Great deal on a refurbished phone. A 36 month contract with a phone carrier to get a similar phone would have cost me double."
"iPhone 11","Awesome"
"iPhone 11","I love it! I was upset because when received the box was open and the phone was sliding around. It was not damaged though. Other than that the phone it‚Äôs self is awesome! Came with a charger and films on both sides of the phone."
"iPhone 11","Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y‚Äôall. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works."
"iPhone 11","The camera has a lot of cosmetic damage"
"iPhone 11","Product was exactly as described. Was shipped quickly."
"iPhone 11","Esta en perfectas condiciones muy buena compra total mente satisfecha"
"iPhone 11","The phone looks immaculate but the sound sucks - what happened to the volume? Sounds like water damage."
"iPhone 11","Because the phone was renewed it's not water proof so please don't place it in water.
The phone works very good other than the water issue"
"iPhone 11","Phone works and looks like new."
"iPhone 11","Wife loves this phone and me too. The only phone I like better is s20ultra. She got red and the finish is beautiful. Call quality stood out from previous phones as it is exceptionally loud n clear. Sounds like the people you're talking to are right in front of you"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôd rather not add video. But love my phone"
"iPhone 11","This is a great phone, great price and I am very happy with buying a renewed phone! The SIM card removal tool was underneath the packaging and I used the end of a paperclip not knowing it was included due to the reviews!"
"iPhone 11","Came in excellent condition"
"iPhone 11","Llego en muy buenas condiciones, solo un detalle en la esquina un rasponcito y un ligero ara√±aso en la pantalla pero que ni se nota, ademas la bateria llego con el 96%. Recomiendo este vendedor"
"iPhone 11","Even though this was a refurbished phone it still looked like new. Works great and came with a 100% battery which was a biggie for us. Came with aftermarket accessories, but that's what the listing said it would have. We are happy with our purchase."
"iPhone 11","Every thing is rigth"
"iPhone 11","Amazing find for a present! The person loved their gift and got it for a great price. Easy to transfer info onto new phone and everything runs smoothly! Thanks"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôm so happy I took a chance and purchased this phone. It‚Äôs fantastic"
"iPhone 11","At first when I powered it on it display not a original Apple product after dismissing the msg it working with out a hitch"
"iPhone 11","Great purchase"
"iPhone 11","This was a very good value for our money. Love the quality of the pictures it takes and the battery last a long time. Couldn‚Äôt be happier if it was a new one !! We actually bought two of them one black and one in red. Both are great!!!"
"iPhone 11","The phone is great but the battery percentage is on 88% which I believe could have been at least 95% for a renewed iPhone 11."
"iPhone 11","It was worth the money . Fast shipping . It was also unexpected because it came in 4 days before the due date , came in perfect , I thought it would‚Äôve been a scam . But it wasn‚Äôt ! Also it was delivered to my door ! It was great ! I do recommend to buy this ! Would I buy it again ? YEEESSS !"
"iPhone 11","I ordered an iPhone 11 for my niece's birthday took a week to come in when I received how did defective screen horrible customer service did not offer any kind of logical solution DO NOT BUY from this seller spend your money elsewhere."
"iPhone 11","So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we‚Äôll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don‚Äôt feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.
I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI."
"iPhone 11","The Phone speaker was wasted. It's not worth the headache to send it back. Cost $75 bucks to have new speakers installed.

""fully refurbished"" not exactly. But hey, You're throwing the dice on a used product.."
"iPhone 11","I like everything, except it has a little bit of scratch but overall it‚Äôs good"
"iPhone 11","I can not believe that these people did not test this phone. This phone was horrible. First of all, the phone looked ok when I got it. When I turn it on it would not charge up, so it took it to my local carrier and they this phone has not been cleaned out to hold a charge. They cleaned phone out and charge me $5.00 dollars to do that, than took it home and it still would not charge up. Absolutely will return phone, PLEASE , PLEASE vendors check these phone to make sure they work before you sell and send them out."
"iPhone 11","this was a great purchase recommend to anyone wanting a perfect phone"
"iPhone 11","The phone has met my expectations."
"iPhone 11","Great deal for the price. Has ran flawless since purchase 3 months ago. No problems with anything so far"
"iPhone 11","I like this phone upgrade it from a droid so far so good I like the picture quality seems like a pretty good phone"
"iPhone 11","Huge improvemnet from the iphone 6s that i had earlier. hopefully sometime in the future apple will finally listen to us users and improve the battery life on iphone."
"iPhone 11","Not a single scratch in sight. Works just like new. It did not come in the original iphone box though, i don‚Äôt care but some people may."
"iPhone 11","I would suggest you stay away from getting any phone from them! The phone would not get any service for 3 weeks. We were constantly calling our cell phone service complaining to them that it wasn‚Äôt working. They sent out a new SIM card and we were still having problems. We go to Best Buy to get them to check the phone and they tell us the phone is not capable of getting service! They tell us the hardware is damaged on the phone! Do not waste your time or money!"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","It worked and all but there was a few small scratches on it and I returned it. I had no problems with the return and luckily didn't have to pay to return the phone. Its a beautiful looking phone. I give it 3 stars because it is such a good phone and the return was easy and fair. I just hope they can be more diligent making sure there are no scratches on a phone before they send it."
"iPhone 11","Great phone. Was as advertised. Shipping was perfect and right on time."
"iPhone 11","I bought this and used it for about two years and recently gifted it to my daughter. It doesn‚Äôt act used, even after I used it. Battery life stays long as long as you don‚Äôt use with while charging but that‚Äôs any phone."
"iPhone 11","The iPhone come with 1 minimal scratch on the left side(volume button), but in summary is cool.Battery 93%. Worth the buy."
"iPhone 11","Good buy. I got my phone on timel. The phone is almost looks brand new also battery life is great, camera works amazing. I so happy with my purchase. Definitely a Good product"
"iPhone 11","Fast shipping/delivery. Came a day earlier than expected. Phone appearance is ‚Äúas new‚Äù and everything functions as it should. Came with a reasonably charged battery to be able to transfer and set-up from previous phone. Daughter loves it."
"iPhone 11","Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches. Wasn‚Äôt included in description, and def not worth the full price of phone. Overall I rather not send it back so I guess I‚Äôm dealing w it."
"iPhone 11","Llego el iphone con 90% de vida de bateria, y un rayon en una de las esquinas del marco. Fuera de eso, contento con la entrega y sin problemas con el equipo renovado."
"iPhone 11","Very good"
"iPhone 11","The front speaker of the phone does not function at all, which means that you have to use speaker mode when calling others. The battery life was horrible, and there were at least 5 scratches on the screen, with a chip on the camera. Amazon, renew the phones properly."
"iPhone 11","Phone looks new"
"iPhone 11","No issues this far great for price & the 11 is actually bigger than the 13 no scratches or dents great battery life"
"iPhone 11","Love the phone. It did not have a mark or flaw on it. Buy with confidence. Saved a lot of money. My only issue is that it‚Äôs not holding a charge. I upgraded from a 6 to an 11. Not one issue switching the phone from one to another. I have Straighttalk service. I am in heaven. Not missing the home button either!"

"iPhone 11","It has some scratches in the body that makes it ugly, but still it works fine. Battery level was at 87%."
"iPhone 11","Equipment in good condition, with 100% battery condition, but it did not arrive in the color that I made in the order, I ordered a purple iphone 11 64Gb and it arrived in black"
"iPhone 11","Great phone came with a screen protector installed. Has a small chip in the upper right hand side of the rear glass which appears to be the only blemish on the phone."
"iPhone 11","My iPhone never worked properly had problems right out of the package. I requested a return label sent to my physical address....never came! Now they say it's too late to return. Don't give them a chance to screw you over as well..inus 10 stars"
"iPhone 11","I liked that when I got it there was nothing wrong with the phone. No dislike whatsoever"
"iPhone 11","We were very pleased with our purchase"
"iPhone 11","The phone was almost new but the screen was damaged, the entire left side of the screen didn‚Äôt work, letters WSZADQX couldn‚Äôt be pressed so I had to pay for a new screen wich cost me 150$"
"iPhone 11","I won hundred percent absolutely love my phone it came with a good battery no nicks no dings no scratches just a perfect phone camera is great have no issues with my phone delivery was smooth transfer was smooth absolutely would buy another phone from this company"

"iPhone 11","It really comes like it promise in the description."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Everything is good. Phone is unlocked and the battery capacity is great. Came with a charger and a screen protector that was already on the phone. No scratches, just like new."
"iPhone 11"," Everything is good. Phone is unlocked and the battery capacity is great. Came with a charger and a screen protector that was already on the phone. No scratches, just like new."
"iPhone 11","Terrible product. I received this iPhone 11 unlocked. It seemed to have worked good at first. It lasted for 2 months under 90 days. Took it to apple they said it was a software malfunction and nothing can be done. The phone just dropped service one day and it could not be repaired. I hope the people selling these phone do a thorough check of the device before listing it."
"iPhone 11","Great deal for $500...Genuine seller...95% performance...
Kudos to Seller.."
"iPhone 11","Friends, just for you know ""renewed"" is a euphemism for ""used"". You will get a used phone.

My phone had two cosmetic wear signals. The corner of the screen was scratched and it has a dent in the corner."
"iPhone 11","El celular llego sin se√±as de haber sido usado por ottros, y desbloquedo para cualquier operador. Sin duda una buena inversion."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","The phone started messing up a couple days after use. It also had a small crack on the camera lens."
"iPhone 11","There was a problem with the volume on this phone. Unless it was on speaker phone I couldn‚Äôt hear the caller. I could not find a reasonable way to exchange, and so I re-ordered and returned the original. However, Amazon decided to refund my account in a gift card to my account , rather than refunding my credit card. Before I realized what had happened, one of my kids placed a small order, paying with the gift card. Thus, Amazon refused to change the refund method. Thus,, I‚Äôm left with two phones on my credit card and nearly $400 in Amazon credit. BEWARE!!!"
"iPhone 11","Ive had disappointing experiences in the past with other refurbished phones but this one went well. The phone came completely scratch-free and looked brand new. The battery health was at 97%; impresssive."
"iPhone 11","It came looking brand new and works brand new I‚Äôve had no problems with the phone at all it‚Äôs had like 2 small scratches but for half the price it‚Äôs definitely a good deal"
"iPhone 11","The speakers don‚Äôt work like they are suppose too. The battery life on the phone isn‚Äôt what is should be. The phone did come with a screen protector, which is very good! The phone should at least be checked for faults before sending out at least if your going to pay the amount your paying for just my opinion at least."
"iPhone 11","This is my first time buying a phone from Amazon, the phone is in perfect condition besides the fact that the left microphone is defective. The phone does not come with original iPhone charger but it comes with a screen protector."
"iPhone 11","El celular vino como nuevo con 100% de bater√≠a, ya anteriormente hab√≠a comprado un IPhone XR para m√≠, este es para mi pareja y vino mucho mejor que el m√≠o, lo recomiendo completamente o simplemente tuve suerte con ambos, los celulares son desbloqueados ya que son usados en Panama donde vivo."
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived on time and looks and works like new. It was a great value for the price."
"iPhone 11","Everything about this phone would‚Äôve been perfect, until I tried using speaker phone‚Äî it‚Äôs extremely muffled. The phones speaker output is defective, so expect flaws with refurbished phones. I‚Äôve never had a negative experience until this purchase but I still can‚Äôt entirely hate it. I guess just do more research."
"iPhone 11","Phone faulty, returned it about two weeks ago and still haven't gotten my refund."
"iPhone 11","Product was described as excellent with a minimum battery life of 80%. Battery is below that and more blemishes to be called excellent."
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone in March and started having problems with it two months later. It completely stop turning on in June and We've been trying to get it fixed . However, Apple can not recognize the battery and now this company won't exchange it for a different one.I've purchased apple products from Amazon for years and never had a problem such as this one.Avoid this problem and just pay the apple price. I now have to buy another phone for my daughter. I feel so bad this was her birthday gift and she was so exited."
"iPhone 11","The phone came with a charger and block. The screen was nice and came with a screen protector. It isn‚Äôt dirty that is just my mirror. It feels nice and there were no cracks. Love it!!"
"iPhone 11","I was expecting a USED phone (visible signs of) but instead, you can hardly tell that it has been used other that the two (very faint) scratches at the back. The phone works well and was unlocked. Original charger also came with the phone."
"iPhone 11","So this iPhone 11 I just spent around 400$ Says it was refurbished LOL. Only thing is... the ear speaker AND loud speaker are 100% garbage. Need to make a call? Oh wait let me put my headphones in so I can hear anything!!"
"iPhone 11","Phone is like brand new. No scratches. I love it"
"iPhone 11","Phone was in very good condition. It was as advertised, very very minor scratches only noticeable when phone was up close, not visible at arms length. I highly recommend!"
"iPhone 11","I just got my phone today, and unboxed my phone cautiously. I found a scratch on my phone, it was not worth buying when theres something wrong. I really thought it would be brand new."
"iPhone 11","Bought this puppy refurbished for my wife's bday because I'm cheap. Didn't expect it to continue working as well as it has now almost a year later. Thanks for supporting my frugalness"
"iPhone 11","Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasn‚Äôt new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldn‚Äôt because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day."
"iPhone 11","I feel this phone is okay but had glitches and problems from the beginning!!"
"iPhone 11","The phone came earlier than expected and I‚Äôm honestly really happy with it :) It‚Äôs for sure a good buy the phone looked basically brand new and I love the color!"
"iPhone 11","El funcionamiento es ok"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had this phone for 3months and it has started to glitch and freeze. Buy the warranty package. I purchased another phone with the warranty protection package and I forgot to add the warranty to this phone as well. :(((( the phone works well enough just a minor annoyance."
"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs a great phone, exactly what I wanted, it works really well, I love Face ID. Battery life is much longer than older iPhones, and I‚Äôm glad it doesn‚Äôt have the fingerprint reader anymore. Really good value."
"iPhone 11","There are both side of mobile have scratch mark when I am not satisfied with sailor because of when bought the mobile that time nothing to show about scratch mark"
"iPhone 11","Loved the phone just popped my sim in and it works the screen was gorgeous no problems I love my 11 so much thank u and greatest value for your money please buy and it came a day early"
"iPhone 11","DO NOT BUY THIS!! I was so exited to to unpack my new phone and it looked Brand new. Then after using it for a day it just started turning off while I was using it, and it would be completely charged. It‚Äôs been a week now and I can‚Äôt even use it, it turns of after using it for 2 minuets!! And it won‚Äôt even charge now I‚Äôve plugged it in for hours and it won‚Äôt charge defiantly returning!!

"iPhone 11","Battery at 76%üëé"
"iPhone 11","I purchased the iPhone 11 from Hybrid IT a week ago , it arrived on time . As with any renewed phone I check to make sure everything is working , Cameras , Face recognition , Speakers . Everything was looking good then I went to see if the wireless charging works ,an it didn‚Äôt connect . I thought well maybe it‚Äôs my charger , So I took it to APPLE and low and behold the wireless charging back does not work .

When buying renewed phones I‚Äôm aware there may be some cosmetic scuffs or scratches but when something is internally wrong with the phone like the last one sold to me with a broken speaker from hybrid . Are ya‚Äôll not checking your phones before you send them out bcs at this point it feels like it ?? This is ridiculous .

I‚Äôve called them multiple times and they won‚Äôt answer I need a replacement phone or my money back!"
"iPhone 11","Funciona perfecto. Los accesorios no son originales pero funcionan perfectamente."
"iPhone 11","Ok, but not great. First phone arrived with a scratch on the screen, so I returned and bought another. The 2nd phone arrived and the battery heath is at 86%, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have to replace soon."
"iPhone 11","The battery life is amazing it last me a whole day, it took me awhile to get use to not having a home button but one thing i do like is the camera quality"
"iPhone 11","Great phone so far! Came a day earlier than Amazon said which is great! Also received a screen protector and phone case for free!!! Thank you. So far couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase."
"iPhone 11","This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it‚Äôs original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
"iPhone 11","Bateria a menos del 93% de rendimiento"
"iPhone 11","I purchased this phone as a gift and was as expected. Small dings on the back side but no major defect and the phone works great."
"iPhone 11","First time purchaser.
I was hopeful that I would get a phone in a decent enough shape to gift, but unfortunately, the phone arrived with deep unremovable scratches on the front glass, which is a bit odd because they are supposed to be gorilla-glass quality glass. Now Im having to attempt to re-purchase in hopes to get another one in better quality in time for Christmas, I hope this process becomes more effective."
"iPhone 11","I bought it, noticed small damaged by the charge port and scratches on the screen.. my battery is significantly damaged and needs replacement‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd think with a renewed phone at that price that you‚Äôd get a good battery‚Ä¶ oh well"
"iPhone 11","The phone was 50 % changed and packaged right but the screen has 2 big scratches"
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived in good condition but a few days after the 3 month warranty expired the touch screen stopped working. Contacted the seller to see if they would make an exchange and was told to go to Best Buy. This is the second Amazon refurbished phone we‚Äôve bought that has had trouble after only a few months. If you only want a working phone for three months then this is the place to shop."
"iPhone 11","I purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 in ""excellent"" condition, but it had a 1 inch scratch across the screen"
"iPhone 11","Bueno"
"iPhone 11","Terrible product. I purchased it a few weeks ago, and within a couple days the apps stopped opening properly. A little after that the screen started to glitch a pink color and the phone started restarting randomly on its own. Be warned if you buy this, you have to pay for your own return shipping and it is not free like many of Amazons merchants. Extremely disappointed with the product and will not be purchasing another refurbished iphone from the seller."
"iPhone 11","100% worth it. This phone came brand new for a phone that was supposed to be ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù it‚Äôs my second phone purchase from them and they were both new. If your skeptical don‚Äôt be üíØüíØüíØ"
"iPhone 11","Super fast shipping, phone in pristine condition AND a free gift (A cute pink phone case I absolutely love) this phone has been a good buy thus far....üíú"
"iPhone 11","Just got the iPhone 11 and says the battery is not a Apple product after we hooked it up."
"iPhone 11","The seller sent me a defective phone. The SIM card reader did not work with any of my sims."
"iPhone 11","The battery life was low and came with a cracked back. Seller stayed battery life would be at least 90% and it was not so with this phone"
"iPhone 11","I went from an IPhone6 to this phone. After the culture/adjustment shock, I am loving it. Ii received it promptly and it was even better than described"
"iPhone 11","This is by far the best deal ever! I kid you not 100% battery life, no scratches on the screen, it came in a nasty box and everthing was after market but overall the phone and charger are very good and will get my next phone from them again"
"iPhone 11","If you are planning on buying this phone it is worth it. I just received it today and I am using it as I am typing this. It is amazing and I have no problems with it so far. It is legit so don‚Äôt hesitate just buy it."
"iPhone 11","Great Buy! I love this phone! It‚Äôs in great shape! Works great! Highly recommend you get it if you looking to pay a used phone."
"iPhone 11","Love it somethings don‚Äôt work which is weird but it‚Äôs alright"
"iPhone 11","I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expectedü§óü§ó)and it is absolutely lovelyü§©. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.üòÅüòÅ‚úÖ"
"iPhone 11","Just wanted a phone that worked. This phone had problems from the start, then called contacts at random and the touch screen failed. Cost $138 to replace faulty screen"
"iPhone 11","This phone had me like wow when I got it but it didn‚Äôt come with an charger but it‚Äôs still a great phone"
"iPhone 11","This phone is amazing. When I received the package it didn‚Äôt come with any scratches. Also, the battery works amazing!!!"
"iPhone 11","The iPhone had several scratch that's the part I didn't like"
"iPhone 11","Phone came in perfect condition also had a screen protector already on so that was cool. Battery usually lasts me the whole day"
"iPhone 11","I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn‚Äôt allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn‚Äôt get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don‚Äôt have anymore ‚Ä¶ at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this company. But new or from Amazon‚Äôs renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction."
"iPhone 11","I think I got a pretty good deal, very pleased"
"iPhone 11","Less than a week old I got an error that there is a non-Apple battery. Now it won‚Äôt start up, it cycles through bringing up the Apple logo and then shuts off. Returning it."
"iPhone 11","I love it! It was just like new, the battery life was at 100."
"iPhone 11","The phone looked brand new, but you could hardly hear callers and the media volume couldn't be turned up to medium. It would become unresponsive at times as well. Why does Amazon only sell refurbished iPhones?"
"iPhone 11","Works perfectly fine as if it‚Äôs brand new!!! was skeptical at first but it‚Äôs fully unlocked and it‚Äôs definitely worth the purchase !!!"
"iPhone 11","The corners are beaten and scraped"
"iPhone 11","I had to return. Didn‚Äôt work at all out of the box.
I returned it."
"iPhone 11","Was very happy with the Excellent condition of the phone only had it one day seems to be operating perfectly fine!"
"iPhone 11","No me agrado la pantalla me vino rayada es lo √∫nico, el resto si fue una buena inversion"
"iPhone 11","I had everything transferred to my new phone, when suddenly my first phone call came in. To my surprise, you could barely hear any sound through the speaker despite the volume being turned up to max! Just my luck that the speaker doesn‚Äôt work considering I‚Äôm blind. Oh well, please give me my money back, and properly test your stuff.

UPDATE- after ordering a brand new iPhone 11, which was not much more expensive than this renewed version, I realized that they didn‚Äôt even put the correct screen on the one I received from the seller. broken speaker, and incorrect screen. What else will I find wrong next? well, nothing, because I‚Äôm sending it back for a refund."
"iPhone 11","Great price and basically brand new! This phone was very easy to set up and I love the upgrade from a 7 !"
"iPhone 11","Phone speaker barely works, might as well not be there. Battery life degraded so fast. Loud speaker has one side working. Finger and face recognition inconsistent"
"iPhone 11","Absolutely LOVE this phone!!! I‚Äôve had it since February and haven‚Äôt had any issues at all so grateful!!"
"iPhone 11","Have had this phone for 3 months now and no issues! Battery life is great and worked with our pay by month phone plan"
"iPhone 11","We received the phone today and it's locked! It's really disappointing because we need it asap and now can't use it."
"iPhone 11","Got in perfect condition and definitely recommend it was very fast and easy to set up with T-Mobile"
"iPhone 11","With the shipping it was 701 but that‚Äôs okay I understand there‚Äôs a lot to get it to you EARLIER THAN EXPECTED & in GREAT condition during the pandemic going on. I truly appreciate it and I‚Äôm happy with my new phone! Cheers !"
"iPhone 11","Cut off in the middle of use. Refund time too long should not have to wait 30 days to get my money back"
"iPhone 11","As soon as I turned on the phone it was glitching like this. This is my first iphone so I was hoping for a better first experience."
"iPhone 11","I am very pleased with this phone. It is just as described and works beautifully."
"iPhone 11","This phone is great, came in great condition, no scratches. Like new"
"iPhone 11","This is my first iPhone and I love it. I was nervous about it not working properly or having scratches on it but it exceeds my expectations. Plus, you can‚Äôt beat the price for all of this storage space."
"iPhone 11","This phone works really well so far and I‚Äôm glad I bought it! I am in love. I was disappointed that the phone could not be used for Boost Mobile but I decided to switch to Verizon and they took care of me!"
"iPhone 11","EL TELEFONO TIENE MUCHAS RAYADURAS EN LA PANTALLA Y POR EL CUERPO DEL TELEFONO LO QUE NO ME GUSTO, ADEMAS TIENE PEQUE√ëOS GOLPES Y COMO EL ALUMINIO ES ROJO SE NOTA CON CLARIDAD NO ME GUSTO LA ESTE TIPO DE VENTA DE REACONDICIONADOS"
"iPhone 11","The phone I was given was defective. Scrolling up without warning and rewinding videos when I‚Äôm watching"
"iPhone 11","While it is a nice phone, I would appreciate if the company wasn't scummy and lied about the conditions of the phone, this is far from excellent and has scratched paint and camera..."
"iPhone 11","I am not sure how the phone can be fully tested. The down volume is clearly not working. After we spent all the setting up, now we are figuring out how to return it. Physical mechanics have to be properly tested. Very disappointed"
"iPhone 11","Exactly what I ordered!Just wish it came with a slim card. Overall great product and fast shipping."
"iPhone 11","My cellular provider disabled my account because this phone is blacklisted. I was unable to use my service for a few days...I have a business to run and my cell number is the main number for my company. Neither Amazon nor the seller were at all apologetic for the inconvenience!"
"iPhone 11","Thought I'd get a new iphone camera before a trip. Wasted so much time trying to fix problems. Makes you wonder if Synergy checks out their phones at all. And doesn't inspire confidence for refurbished."
"iPhone 11","I love my new phone, good quality & it came w/a free case & screen protector."
"iPhone 11","Visualmente parece nuevo, no tiene marcas ni nada que pueda parecer renovado."
"iPhone 11","Best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time. If you are wondering if it‚Äôs legit, it is. Came with a charger and brick and the phone was in PERFECT condition. 100% battery life. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SELLING THIS"
"iPhone 11","good"

"iPhone 11","Battery life going down everyday, other wise it‚Äôs fine!"
"iPhone 11","Love the color and Apple products! So excited that the phone is unlocked and I can use any network on it. The phone looks like it‚Äôs brand new."
"iPhone 11","I love it I brought it for my 13 year old and she loves it!!!!!"
"iPhone 11","Everything on the screen was zoomed in so close I couldn‚Äôt even punch in numbers. Then the phone with freeze. My worst purchase through Amazon by far!"
"iPhone 11","Product went totally defective in less than one year. I would have been better off buying a brand new iPhone from Apple with AppleCare because I would have gotten a better product, better customer support and better warranty. I would have saved money if I didn't buy this knock off phoney phone"
"iPhone 11","I received a 64G phone with flash and overheating issues, although I paid for a 128G phone."
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my daughter. She used it two day and she was contacted that it was stolen."
"iPhone 11","I had little scratches but it was cool"

"iPhone 11","The phone looks like new , working good so far !!!!!"
"iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my daughter 17 years old, she is happy with it . The phone looks good working fine without any problems."
"iPhone 11","I was aware I was buying a used phone. There was the assumption I was being sent a phone in good working order - otherwise what is the point of the ""renewed""? The phone I was sent is self reporting battery replacement is needed.
Was the phone never even turned on over there - yet sold as renewed?
You are welcome to issue me a refund."
"iPhone 11","Demasiado pesado"
"iPhone 11","It didn‚Äôt turn on."
"iPhone 11","I used this product on a daily basis and it works like a charm"
"iPhone 11","Bought a refurbished iphone. The lcd screen had horizontal lines on the day I got it. It shows up intermittently. Not a deal breaker as I need a phone and wouldn't go through the hassle of returning it. But given I paid near 500 dollars for it, it is a disappointment."
"iPhone 11","Excellent means, Excellent condition internal and external.i got my device with a Lot of scratches around the charging port, tempered glass to cover up screen scratches, and battery health is 77%. RENEWED What?"

"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono en su mayor√≠a lleg√≥ tal cual las especificaciones, sin embargo; las bocinas no funcionan."
"iPhone 11","Didn‚Äôt not expect it to come in a different box other than the iPhone box . Other than that it‚Äôs great I am now using my iPhone 11 ! I recommend it came on time üòÉ"
"iPhone 11","It was a great phone but the Bluetooth didn‚Äôt work on it. The company has been great to work with and we‚Äôre just waiting on a refund after having to return it."
"iPhone 11","Every thing is good"
"iPhone 11","Right off the bat I knew something wasn‚Äôt right, the speakers weren‚Äôt loud, camera wasn‚Äôt up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I ‚Äúupdate it‚Äù even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it‚Äôs not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and don‚Äôt see how this is not illegal in some form of way."
"iPhone 11","Daughter love it"
"iPhone 11","Showed up with broken pixels- I would not recommend this at all"

"iPhone 11","i love my new phone its in grate condition and came 2 weeks early"
"iPhone 11","I bought this iPhone in October 2019 and the speaker is already giving issues. Even if something was wrong with the phone before and it was fixed it shouldn‚Äôt have started giving problems so quickly. The return date has already passed so there‚Äôs nothing I can do or I would just send it back but I spent a lot of money on the item so I need something to be done please."
"iPhone 11","No me agrado el porcentaje de vida √∫til de bater√≠a, pero fuera de eso todo correcto y perfecto"
"iPhone 11","Even though it's a refurbished phone, I couldn't tell the difference!!"
"iPhone 11","It was my daughter it seem to be fine she doesn't put it down"

"iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my son's birthday and some suddenly calls he made and received would have no sound. It may work after alot of trouble shooting but it doesn't last.

Obviously this phone was not checked for issues because this started a day after we got it."
"iPhone 11","Works perfect for what I need it to do."
"iPhone 11","It's for my daughter and she loves it"
"iPhone 11","Looks brand new. Arrived way sooner than expected. Would recommend"
"iPhone 11","Do not waste your time or money. These phones do not come unlocked, and therefore you CANNOT use them. They look great but they are locked by the previous owners carrier. You cannot unlock these phones. Just spent two hours on the phone with sprint and T-mobile to learn that lesson. Do not buy these refurbished phones."

"iPhone 11","When I turned the phone on, it began powering off and on several times, so I knew something was wrong. Would not stay connected to my wi-fi, tried to update it and the screen went black and stayed black. I took it to a repair shop and it couldn't be fixed. Just sent it back. I've bought my last two refurbished phones on Amazon and never had a problem. Not sure about these ""renewed"" phones. My son bought one a few months ago and his was fine. So buyer beware it's a gamble."
"iPhone 11","Great service"
"iPhone 11","Upon receiving this iPhone 11 I found it had a screen glitch where the top of the screen would not register my finger's touch. After my warranty ran out this phone developed a battery problem and now it dies at any percentage (including 98%!!!) and has even died twice while charging. This was my first experience with Amazon's ""Renewed"" phones and I won't be buying that again."
"iPhone 11","I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return. I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated. They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!"
"iPhone 11","Received locked phone. Otherwise phone looks pretty good."
"iPhone 11","Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better buy. Phone is perfect!"
"iPhone 11","Veeeeery satisfied !!!"
"iPhone 11","I like the phone but I Had to return it because it was damaged. A long frustrating ordeal. I am still waiting for my phone 2 weeks later. The first and the last time I .will buy a phone here."

Very annoying issues. Decided to get a replacement and the shipment has been delayed 3x now. Will be sending this one back and be out of a phone for at least a week. Will report back when I get the replacement. My family has bought refurbished phones multiple times with no issue, but I had to write an honest review so far."

"iPhone 11","I cannot believe this. We purchased the ""new"" condition of this phone and it came with scratches and holes in it! I am so incredibly disappointed. What a waste of money!"
"iPhone 11","Works just like it was new even came with screen protector."

"iPhone 11","Bought refurbished I‚Äôm assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller"
"iPhone 11","Terrible item. Had to take it to the apple store to even activate. Stated it has ""unauthorized equipment"" but Apple got it working. Phone randomly starts shutting down. Then, at the first update it shuts down & won't connect to charger, computer, anything! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY"
"iPhone 11","Great deal and works with sim any carrier"
"iPhone 11","The phone was advertised as being fully unlocked I had to change carriers just to get the phone activated if I knew it was still locked I never would have brought it"
"iPhone 11","I would really recommend this phone, came with a 100 percent battery health, like brand new"
"iPhone 11","Good phone for money"
"iPhone 11","I love my new phone. Lilac is my favorite color!"
"iPhone 11","I use it for for everything. I love it."
"iPhone 11","Great phone and the seller was so helpful!!"
"iPhone 11","Poco lento pero por lo dem√°s bie"
"iPhone 11","Al encender el equipo, me percat√© que ten√≠a un defecto en un pixel completo de la pantalla, luego que ingreso el sistema me arroja que colocaron una pantalla que no es la original, totalmente insatisfecho con la compra. No recomendado."
"iPhone 11","Returning as it will not take a charge."
"iPhone 11","The SIM chip reader did not work even though it claimed to be working. Ultimately defeating the purpose of me buying the phone."
"iPhone 11","The phone came i excellent condition looked like it was new 100% battery works great"
"iPhone 11","This phone looks and works like a new phone. Extremely happy with it."
"iPhone 11","The phone looked in good shape, but it was locked and couldn't activate it. T-mobile told me that the previous owner has either reported lost or stolen"

"iPhone 11","I am returning this item.
Screen is not flat with the frame."
"iPhone 11","Great Iphone11, Very happy with my purchase. thanks"
"iPhone 11","Came with a bad battery. Avant- solutions refused to replace it even though Amazon guarantees at least 80% battery health."
"iPhone 11","Esta rayada la pantalla y la bater√≠a dura 3 horas solamente"
"iPhone 11","The cell phone has multiple scratches on the screen, which are deep, 100% battery, 100% facial recognition, I was disappointed with the screen but the rest came as promised."
"iPhone 11","Phone came broken and having a hard to to get it replaced or my money refunded"
"iPhone 11","Came perfectly with a amazing battery life"
"iPhone 11","Screen turned white after 8 months! Tried rebooting... etc. nothing worked. Piece of junk! total wate of money."
"iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"iPhone 11","2 days after receiving my device the phones camera went black. I bought apple insurance to get it fixed, now its doing something wonky with the keyboard. I might as well have bought it new from apple for the hassle. I decided to buy based on mixed reviews but most were positive, unfortunately it didnt work out for me."
"iPhone 11","Paid 2/3 the retail price and love it."
"iPhone 11","My new cellphone is perfect!! I love it!!"
"iPhone 11","Work good I like it nice phone"
"iPhone 11","Wonderful"
"iPhone 11","Product was in okay condition. Speakers for IPhone were defective and had to be paid for to be replaced. It was also discovered that the facial recognition feature was not working with the device and must be fixed as well."
"iPhone 11","Right off the bat you can see the phone was visibly dirty and the speakers were filled with dirt. When I tested out the speakers the left side didn‚Äôt work at all and the right side sounded off pitch"
"iPhone 11","The microphone for calls doesn't work. I'm going to be sending this back. To people on the other line, I sound very faint and as if I were in a very busy atmosphere."
"iPhone 11","Works great as expected"
"iPhone 11","It was sim locked"
"iPhone 11","They make it seem like this will work like a brand new phone, but it seems like they just sell your someone‚Äôs old broken one wo fixing it. Dropped calls, no internet, can‚Äôt hear, alllll the things. After shelling out $600 I did not expect that from my phone."
"iPhone 11","Came with noticeable scratches on screen. Large enough to notice at arms length, unlike what is guaranteed in the product description. Sadly I will be returning."
"iPhone 11","It even came with a fast charger, great conditions, loving it"
"iPhone 11","Thickness"
"iPhone 11","When arrived, battery life was already at 80%. My husband has had this same phone for two years and he‚Äôs still in the 90‚Äôs. After researching, I was able to get the same phone for very close to the same price at the Apple store near me and it was brand new. The refund process was fairly easy though."
"iPhone 11","Every time they send a new phone. It doesn't work correctly. There is something always wrong with it. These are not refurbished phones. They are junk used ones"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","The phone came without a scratch. Easy to set up. Everything works."
"iPhone 11","Was super excited to receive product, however‚Ä¶ the screen was super scratched. Phone was sooo dirty and had a lot of scuff marks on it. Then the battery only had a maximum capacity of 86% and you can buy a NEW iPhone 11 64GB from apple for the same price as this‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt waste your money"
"iPhone 11","Camera is totally messed up. I thought these were supposed to be verified to work properly? I am returning and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. Check everything when you receive your phone because this obviously was not checked very well. Camera makes a static noise and shakes. Totally unusable."
"iPhone 11","Muchas gracias me gust√≥ la c√°mara est√° de exelenteüëçüòÅ"
"iPhone 11","I had the phone for less than a month and it worked beautifully but then it wouldn't turn on anymore wouldn't work no matter how long I charged it or where I took it. So I requested a refund and sent it back and it has been over a month and still no refund. Be careful guys."
"iPhone 11","The main reason I was upgrading my phone was for the nicer camera. Unfortunately the camera wouldn't focus and made a loud clicking noise whenever the camera app was open. Returned, and hoping to have better luck next time"
"iPhone 11","Eveyething work but my speaker has been messed up since I got it idk why but the speaker sucks phone go in and out"
"iPhone 11","It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it"
"iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"iPhone 11","Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months). Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version. Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one. I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous. Worst decision ever buying this one.Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version."
"iPhone 11","I love my new phone it‚Äôs great"
"iPhone 11","Phone was not unlocked‚Ä¶very unfair to me as a customer"
"iPhone 11","COMPLETELY SCRATCHED. They put a screen protector on it so I don‚Äôt notice the amount of scratches on the phone. DO NOT RECOMMEND. IT‚ÄôS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."
"iPhone 11","very bad conditions"
"iPhone 11","Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someone‚Äôs pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one."
"iPhone 11","""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again."
"iPhone 11","The cell price was too high comparing to all damage on the phone frame and camera ring. Next time make this failure visible and sell for a fair price."
"iPhone 11","cant beat it for the price!"
"iPhone 11","I bought jt hoping jt was a iPhone but to my surprise it was not a iPhone as it says it does not say iPhone on the back where it should it says product"
"iPhone 11","The phone works great!"
"iPhone 11","Excelente tel√©fono üëç y muy buena la c√°mara lo recomiendo 100%"
"iPhone 11","The speakers were blown out."
"iPhone 11","Great phone .."
"iPhone 11","Screen problems since day one try to get a replacement but no answer finally get a partial refund lost about 50% of value, they install a cheap screen n sell to smeoneelse"
"iPhone 11","perfect phone came with headphones & a good charger"
"iPhone 11","The phone so far seems to run OK but for $500 I expect it not to be extremely scratched and just tore up I can understand as a refurbished phone a few scratches here and there but this one just came extremely extremely scratched and tore up"
"iPhone 11","The product arrived damaged with multiple visible scratches on the touch screen."
"iPhone 11","Great phone! Must buy!"
"iPhone 11","It will not charge , the charge charges backwards . And it will die in maybe a 20 min span"
"iPhone 11","Defective phone, needed a motherboard. This phone was absolute garbage. I sent it to Ghana, Africa to a cousin so there‚Äôs no way I can return it for full refund. I got screwed on this deal big-time."
"iPhone 11","Pantalla no original salta mensaje de que el repuesto no es original y se reinicia cada 3 minutos, luego de restaurarlo por itunes no prendio mas. Es la cuarta vez que me pasan cosas extra√±as con telefonos usados"
"iPhone 11","it seemed like new the thing I didn‚Äôt like is was it wasn‚Äôt in its original boxing didn‚Äôt even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it‚Äôs refurbished and the seller won‚Äôt help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I‚Äôm mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don‚Äôt buy this product as it‚Äôs just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won‚Äôt even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant"
"iPhone 11","I've only had the phone for 6 months and the mother board went out"
"iPhone 11","I like"
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best. Here's to hoping that their returns process works better than the eyesight of whoever ""certifies"" their phones..."
"iPhone 11","Very good"
"iPhone 11","Battery works a little damge but not that bad. Put a case on it don't even notice it."
"iPhone 11","The phone arrived packaged well and looked brand new out of the box. Unfortunately, the particular phone I received crashes constantly. The apps themselves and phone randomly close or restart. Will be returning."
"iPhone 11","I was told that this phone was made in China and was not actually an iPhone by the people in 2 stores that I tried to get a card for it. It would not even take a charge and turn on!!"
"iPhone 11","phone Was in good condition no scratches"
"iPhone 11","Great"
"iPhone 11","Great product. Looks and works exactly like new"
"iPhone 11","Great phone"
"iPhone 11","Love it!!"
"iPhone 11","Because it‚Äôs active on another carrier I had to wait 10 days for my phone to be fixed"
"iPhone 11","La pantalla t√°ctil no funciona."
"iPhone 11","It kept looping from a black screen to the Apple logo and never fully booting up. Absolute garbage. Now I have to take it to a UPS store and send it back, then wait for it to get there, and then wait an additional 3 days for my refund."
"iPhone 11","Good as new!"
"iPhone 11","Couldn‚Äôt put service on the phone, even though it was fully ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù."
"iPhone 11","lamentablemente al ser de segunda presenta fallas la bateria vino al 90%, y se apaga se cuelga se prende solo para lo poco q ahorre hubiese preferido uno nuevo nuevo."
"iPhone 11","I really enjoy this phone"
"iPhone 11","Wonderful"
"iPhone 11","Did not like this at all. Screen had a scratch that is more like a crack through. So that's like the screen is broken. Not happy at all."
"iPhone 11","good"
"iPhone 11","Phone is defective and I‚Äôve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone won‚Äôt stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I don‚Äôt like leaving bad reviews but I‚Äôm extremely frustrated and this hasn‚Äôt been resolved."
"iPhone 11","Perfecto"
"iPhone 11","Great Phone."
"iPhone 11","As described excellent purchase"
"iPhone 11","Great phone so far"
"iPhone 11","I opened it and tried to turn it on and half the screen was black and the screen was literally coming off I am so excited to get my refund üòë"
"iPhone 11","The phone dies quickly and the face id doesn't work at all don't buy unless you want a phone with an issue"
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone has scratches on it, it seems the phone is a stolen phone. Under settings, a notification displays, this I phone is supervised and managed by a certain entity. What should I do?"

"iPhone 11","Battery is 75%"
"iPhone 11","It's ok"
"iPhone 11","I will never buy refurbished again! Speaker didn't work, and phone was unusable. Bought before I needed it and could not return it once I found out the speaker and microphone didn't work"
"iPhone 11","I recommend to anyone who is going to invest their money in this not to buy it, they are not supposed to sell damaged things, buy one of these and it would turn on and off by itself, so it is useless to sell something damaged"
"iPhone 11","Screen has visible scratches"
"iPhone 11","I purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked . When I searched for iphone 11a I put Boost mobile only to find out this phone isn‚Äôt compatible to boost mobile and I‚Äôm really upset and pissed because I spent almost $800 on this phone plus shipping and handling only to find out the phone isn‚Äôt even compatible with Boost. I will be getting a refund , credit or something"
"iPhone 11","Phone was advertised as a renewed i-Phone 11, T-Mobile. It is in great condition, but was locked and not compatible with T-Mobile. Very disappointed in the false advertising."
"iPhone 11","Older than I was inspecting"
"iPhone 11","If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it."
"iPhone 11","After 5 months the phone started to glitch. The keyboard is bad and has to be replaced."
"iPhone 11","I just got this phone the other day and I could not do the update on it. If you cannot update it you cannot get past that screen to setup the phone. I was really disappointed"
"iPhone 11","This was my first iphone (and most likely my last). There are a few good things about it; however, they aren't enough to warrant the price. There are a lot better phones, I feel like the budget phone I came from shot better photos and video. The camera on the iphone does poor in low light settings. It glitches out a lot and worst of all, it is super fragile. Even in an otterbox, this thing got super dinged up."
"iPhone 11","Package arrived in a damaged cheap box with no phone it. Just a charger
My son spent his own $500 to be very disappointed

"iPhone 11","Doesn‚Äôt read t mobile SIM card, wast of time and money."
"iPhone 11","Unable ro connect to metro or boost just get a new one because this one was not getting a signal I got a new one from apple and it works great"

"iPhone 11","Did not receive phone charge nor headphones"
"iPhone 11","This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth i"

"iPhone 11","Does it work with sprint network?"
"iPhone 11","I am FURIOUS!! I bought this and NO WAY TO CHARGE IT!! They don't bother adding in of plug so that you can actually charge the phone! Their excuse to save on admissions? Really? Now I have to go and order one before I can use my phone that I just spent $600 on! They don't even provide you a way to plug it in and charge it! It's all a scam so that you are forced to spend more money to charge it once you get it! And I think that sucks it's a scam to rip off their customers if you want to buy a phone don't buy one that doesn't come with a plug. SCAM!"

"iPhone 11","The phone had so many dents not even scratcheS DENTS!!!! I paid$587.00, which is $12.00 less than apple sellig it for $599, I had no idea it was so cheap on apple, else I would have bought it from there. I am so disappointed with how bad the phone looks on the outside. So far software is good but other than that it looks like an old phone. I would be happy paying $250.00 for a phone that looks like this not almost $600.00"
"iPhone 11","Tried installing the SIM card from my old Android phone, kept saying I had no service even though the SIM card was a known good and the area I was in was known to have service. Waited a few minutes, nothing changed. Either false advertising and my device wasn't unlocked (despite saying otherwise) or the 4G doesn't work."

"iPhone 11","I broke my cellphone and needed something fast. Delivery was quick and cell phone looked in almost brand new condition. There was a few scuffs on the screen which was sort of disappointing but overall was a great purchase."
"iPhone 11","When buying a refurbished/renewed phone make sure the seller is reliable. The seller that I purchased from is ‚ÄúAvant Solutions‚Äù the phone came in good condition, no scratches on the screen except the notch area which you can notice when you put a flashlight to it. The back as very tiny dents about the size of the point of a knife. There are also a few nicks which are extremely small these imperfections on the back are unnoticeable outdoors and from a distance, you really only notice these flaws when u angle it right. So yea this phone has extremely minor signs of use. The battery health is at 89%. Facial recognition works perfectly the cameras are normal the way it is on any iphone 11 and also runs great. I play cod on it quite a but and it runs smoothly on high graphic settings and doesn‚Äôt heat up much either. Also delivered a few days earlier than estimated."
"iPhone 11","Phone arrived sooner than expected. Came in a sturdy box, new charger. iPhone 11 - Looked like new, no scratches, no dings. Fired it up, transferred my info & apps - and off we went. Very impressed with it. And price was very reasonable. I will definitely buy from them again. Already recommended them to friends and family. **pic is representative of phone I ordered**"

"iPhone 11","Bought in February. Discovered that small crack on front was not smudge. Also - touch to open does not work--Have to tap side button. Too late to do anything but keep phone. Probably would not buy refurbished model next time. Love my Apple products but this was a disappointment."
"iPhone 11","This item arrived earlier than expected however I am more than pleased I had no problem activating it with my carrier it came just as said! The only thing missing was the little tool to get to the Sim card but I guess if that‚Äôs The worst thing that could happen I‚Äôm OK with it. Still hoping they send me one though after reading this review"
"iPhone 11","It came in a really obscure android box which got me sweating a little bit but when I opened it, I was more than happy. It looked brand new. It came with a screen protector already on it and with the charging adapter and chord. The setup was good, and I‚Äôve been using it for 2 months. The only thing I can say that was a little annoying was that it took forever to charge and the charger adapter stopped working which is an easy fix. You can always buy a new adapter if you really so choose which is what I did and I‚Äôve been happy ever since. So if you‚Äôre going to buy this and need confirmation it‚Äôs worth it, this is it."

"iPhone 11","I loved that everything came as described and more. I was expecting a battery capacity of around 90 85 percent, which would have been as the description. I received it with 100 capacity. It has scratches on the display and other parts of the phone but nothing that hinders the experience. I know it was a used phone so my expectations were lower, thankfully my expectations were met and even exceeded."
"iPhone 11","I got the phone expecting I would see some evidence that it was a used phone, but, no no real sign except that it came with after market charging cable and charger. No matter, they worked great. The phones functionality was as described and everything worked. Ito be fair Ihave only had it forabouta week."
"iPhone 11","I got the phone as a gift for my cousin who loves it. Out of the box she was able to get it to work with Metro PCS without issues. Talk, text, internet, she has had no issues. The battery lasts over 3 days without having to recharge (she is a lighter user.) Amazing value for an amazing unit."
"iPhone 11","The phone came in pretty good condition. I was a little worried about battery power since it‚Äôs renewed and the last renewed phone I bought off here the battery power was horrible, it needed charged throughout the day and certain apps would drain the battery within 20 minutes. But this phone the battery lasts me alllll day! And the apps I use don‚Äôt drain it so I would recommend!"

Battery is at 100% even comes with a tempered glass installed perfectly. There was only one small little scratch but it‚Äôs very unnoticeable and the case hides it anyway. I was apprehensive but I‚Äôm very happy with what I got. Plus with Apple no longer giving charging bricks out the box might as well buy this."

"iPhone 11","La bateria no vino en condiciones."
"iPhone 11","Ninguno"
"iPhone 11","My phone‚Äôs battery capacity is at 81 percent which explain why it does faster. Having been an android user in the past, I really like how intuitive iPhone is. The phone works pretty well but the cable that they sent didn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôll recommend getting yourself an apple cable as they give a third party cable and they don‚Äôt give adapter which was surprising for me. But the phone is good although it has a tiny dot on my display for no reason. I‚Äôll still recommend get it as the price is too good and you‚Äôre also being nicer to environment"

"iPhone 11","It‚Äôs perfect! Worth it"
"iPhone 11","The bottom right of my screen kept turning black so I returned it. They got my money back extremely fast and had amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend buying from this company. I bought a different phone from them instead because I read that this phone is known for having the black in the corner :)"
"iPhone 11","Love"
"iPhone 11","Product was perfect definitely a must buy!!"
"iPhone 11","I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and they‚Äôve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If you‚Äôre looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!"
"iPhone 11","I‚Äôve had the phone for a month now and when I got it came in a white box, with no original charger box just a white cable and black generic box. After the plastic was remove the phone showed very little to no damage at all, very small scratches around the corners of the screen from past use but you can barely notice it with a screen protector and a phone case on it. The battery life was 87% when I got it but now it has gone up to 91%, but the battery is amazing and lasts all day. It is fast and reliable. Value for your money, yes. Fave recognition also is fast, the camera is great too, overall great buy"
"iPhone 11","The phone works great, it came fast, and works like it's brand new. There was a few scratches but that's expected with a refurbished device. The battery life was at 88%"
"iPhone 11","I got this phone so quick I needed a quick replacement I was very skeptical of buying a phone from Amazon and it is way cheaper than the ones at other stores and it works great I‚Äôve had mine for two months now it works amazing and it also comes with a apple charger which works amazing as well and I will never buy a phone at retail price again especially since it came a whole week earlier."
"iPhone 11","Arrived a day early, and seems to be in good condition."
"iPhone 11","muy buen estado!"
"iPhone 11","It came with 88% battery health and its not unlocked it also has some scratch‚Äôs present."
"iPhone 11","I was weary buying a refurbished phone but it didn‚Äôt have any marks on it and after a little over 2 months it still works great and battery life is 93% the camera, face id and everything work great. No reason to buy a brand new phone when these come so much cheaper"
"iPhone 11","Ok. Child didn't complain"
"iPhone 11","I was skeptical about this product but it was so good I had to leave a review. The phone is like brand new."

"iPhone 11","Although the battery health is 89% I am over all satisfied with the phone. It looks new, no visible wear on the surface. The product works almost as if it is new as well. Even with the lower battery health level the phone was definitely worth every penny. The seller also overnighted the phone at no extra charge which was really amazing."
"iPhone 11","Used it. Sent it back. Forgot how boring iphones are. Went back to samsung."
"iPhone 11","Everything works wonderfully, looks brand new, and was a great price."

"iPhone 11","Nice"
"iPhone 11","So far it works good my daughter loved it, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the screen protector came broken which was a bummer! But other than that everything works good so far, I'll write another review if it messes up fast ,"

"iPhone 11","I got this phone a couple months back and I was very skeptical being that it was used. You never know what it‚Äôll be like till you have it. Worth the money! The face recognition is amazing and the battery life was at 94%! It had a little tiny scuff mark by the camera and on the screen, not even visible unless you‚Äôre looking for it, but that is it! I 100% recommend buying this product!"
"iPhone 11","This phone came with a three foot long charging cable, a charging block, and a SIM card tray opener. I have had this phone for almost 72 hours (Will update if anything goes wrong) and I have had no problems whatsoever. Touchscreen works great, camera quality is amazing, there‚Äôs no cracks or large blemishes, it‚Äôs an overall amazing purchase, especially for the price. The one annoying thing is that is doesn‚Äôt come with a SIM card, but those can be easily purchased off of Amazon as well. This was money well spent in my opinion, perfect for teenagers or people who just don‚Äôt want to spend over a grand on a phone."

"iPhone 11","Had it for about 3 weeks so far and i love it. It works just as i had hoped and was indeed fully unlocked...there were no scratches or dents. Just FYI, It comes comes in a generic box with a generic lighting cable charger and some manuals. All in all its a legit iPhone!"

"iPhone 11","to start i did not receive the phone in an iphone box , which is fine with me it still came with a charger but not the original iphone charger that usally comes in the box . when i took the phone out there was visible dirt and grime on the phone and in the holes of the phone like the charging port , speakers etc. after a few minutes of digging and scraping i managed to get most of it out but not completely . the only damage to the phone was two scratches near the charging port but THATS IT. the phone was unlocked , the battery life is at 84% , fast shipping (actually came a day earlier) it‚Äôs worth it and easy to set up and use so go ahead and buy it ."

"iPhone 11","Me lleg√≥ literal como nuevo no tiene ning√∫n ray√≥n ni golpe, con 100% capacidad de la bater√≠a, la caja y el cargador que son gen√©ricos, tra√≠a un pl√°stico protector y tambi√©n ven√≠a con el glass puesto, recomiendo"

"iPhone 11","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ el d√≠a que me dec√≠an, lleg√≥ muy bien empaquetado y su cargador sin detalles , el √∫nico detalle que note es en la esquina inferior que no afecta en su funci√≥n, c√°maras, sonido, vibraci√≥n, la batalla true ton, todo bien hasta ahora, la condici√≥n de bater√≠a me lleg√≥ al 83% nada mal espero me dure al menos una carga al d√≠a, pero satisfechos porqu√© me lleg√≥ en buen estado y com la garant√≠a que prometen de 90 d√≠as."
"iPhone 11","De maravilla todo, el cargador era gen√©rico, pero de ah√≠ en m√°s me gust√≥ todo"
"iPhone 11","est√©tica 10 de 10 , la bater√≠a al 95% , el precio es lo que mas me gusto ;)"
"iPhone 11","El producto lleg√≥ con lo que promete, un empaque sencillo, con la garant√≠a, el cargador y cable tipo Lightning y por supuesto el iPhone, que est√° sin un s√≥lo rasgu√±o, cuenta con todas las funciones y especificaciones elegidas, Face ID, True Tone, desbloqueado para cualquier compa√±√≠a y con una mica protectora de buena calidad.

"iPhone 11","Lo compre por qu√© tengo m√°s de 5 a√±os que pase de iOS a Android y quer√≠a probar sin gastar tanto que tal me iba regresando a la manzana. Como era de esperarse la experiencia bastante buena con iOS, intuitivo, √°gil y muy bien depurado (no como mi Xioami y su muy mala interfaze MIUI llena de bugs, que fue b√°sicamente lo que me hizo volver a voltear a iPhone).Por otra parte este iPhone reacondicionado lleg√≥ con una est√©tica casi perfecta, solo un rayon en la pantalla que no era muy visible a simple vista. El gran problema fue la capacidad m√°xima de la bater√≠a, como muestro en las fotos del 77%, y en las especificaciones de Amazon renewed dice que debe ser un m√≠nimo de 80%. Adem√°s que en lo personal siento que el touch quedaba a deber, senti que ten√≠a un lag. Termine haciendo la devoluci√≥n por el tema de la pila y el touch, cero problemas y excelente atenci√≥n por parte del vendedor TELMOV. Lo recomiendo: SI, pero igual busquen un renewed las reciente, espero les sirva mi rese√±a y fotos."
"iPhone 11","Maybe I‚Äôm just a bad photographer, but I went from a single lens iPhone 7 camera to this 2 lens one and don‚Äôt find the quality of the photos much different."
"iPhone 11","El celular lleg√≥ con cargador y cable gen√©rico. La est√©tica es de 9/10, con marcas m√≠nimas de uso. Llev√© el equipo a una Apple Store para que le hicieran un diagn√≥stico integral y solo tuvo alerta en 2 componentes los cuales me especificaron que pod√≠an resolverse con la actualizaci√≥n del iOS. Bateria al 86% de vida √∫til despu√©s de cerca de 800 ciclos de carga. Para un equipo ""renovado"" o de uso, creo que es aceptable y funcional.Conforme lo vaya probando, actualizar√© si algo cambia."
"iPhone 11","Cuando me llego el celular estuve s√∫per feliz ya que me llego impecable, sin raspones, ni golpes, la bater√≠a me llego con 96% practicando como nuevo, sin embargo no venia completo ya que no tra√≠a la bandeja de la tarjeta SIM, mientras no puedo usar por completo el celular ya que no puedo ponerle Sim en lo que consigo la bandeja:("
"iPhone 11","El producto parece nuevo, bater√≠a al 100% y con garant√≠a en el m√≥vil hasta el siguiente a√±o.Excelente producto, volver√≠a a comprar con el vendedor."

"iPhone 11","Calidad y precio"
"iPhone 11","Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ es que lleg√≥ con la bateria al 86, est√° dentro del rango esperado pero esperaba tener suerte. Despu√©s de usarlo unos meses baj√≥ muy r√°pido hasta 75 :("

El celular ven√≠a con una mica de cristal ya puesta, para despistar los rallones, pero de igual manera se notaba bastante, y me daba miedo quit√°rselas por otra rese√±a que lei donde la pantalla estaba peor que la mia, por ende decid√≠ comenzar el proceso de devoluci√≥n (aunque lo voy a volver a comprar aqui en amazon porque esta a un precio nut razonable pero de otro vendedor). Adem√°s el iphone lleg√≥ con un 80% de porcentaje de bateria, lo utilic√© por tres dias y bajo a 79%, la pila me duro alrededor de 10 horas de uso constante en redes sociales. Fuera de la pantalla y la pila, todo funcionaba excelente, por otra parte me dieron un cargador gen√©rico de carga r√°pida que cargaba mas veloz que mi cargador original de apple."

"iPhone 11","Telefono de gama alta y buen funcionamiento"
"iPhone 11","De acuerdo al modelo que compre, el precio me pareci√≥ muy bien, el equipo lleg√≥ en perfecto estado, con la bater√≠a al 100%, llevo casi 1 semana y no ha fallado, todo le funciona bien, lo pude vincular sin problema con mi Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è, trae un cargador y cable gen√©rico como lo indica en la descripci√≥n as√≠ como una caja no original, pero viene bien empaquetado, creo que es cuesti√≥n de suerte, yo me arriesgue y recibe un producto 98% nuevo ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11","El cargador no funcion√≥,"
"iPhone 11","Muy buen producto."
"iPhone 11","Realmente un equipo nuevo aunque sea reacondicionado."
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ a tiempo, muy bien cuidado, sin rayones, la bater√≠a con m√°s del 80%. Solo con un peque√±o detalle en el bot√≥n de desactivar/activar timbre pero por lo dem√°s funciona al 100."
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ muy bien, un peque√±o rasp√≥n en una esquina pero casi no se ve y tambi√©n lleg√≥ con una mica de cristal, la pila al 85% todo muy bien, c√°mara, bloqueo facial, se puede usar con cualquier compa√±√≠a celular, muy buena compra recomiendo"
"iPhone 11","Llego sin ning√∫n detalle, con el 100% de bater√≠a, un muy buen tel√©fono"
"iPhone 11","It came looking brand new with a new charger and was packaged neatly. The battery health is 90% which is good. My only problem with it, is that the front camera lens has tiny scratches but the camera is still clear and good and better with some lighting. Overall it's worth your money."
"iPhone 11","Highly recommend the seller. Phone arrived in excellent condition. It looks just like a brand-new phone."
"iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11","Very pleased with the product and speed of delivery. Happy customer"
"iPhone 11","El celular me lleg√≥ con 81% de bater√≠a, esto quiere decir que en poco tiempo de uso ser√° necesario hacer un cambio de bater√≠a urgente (Esto para evitar los bajones bruscos de bater√≠a utilizando el equipo) Por ejemplo, use el equipo un d√≠a y del 26% de bater√≠a paso a 10% y despu√©s al 6% y se apag√≥.El equipo tambi√©n se sobrecalent√≥ en repetidas ocasiones, la pantalla venia rayada.Creo que por el precio no vale la pena."
"iPhone 11","compre este producto por el precio y por lo mismo no esperaba mas, tiene algunos detalles est√©ticos pero no son visibles a simple vista y la bater√≠a viene debajo del 80%"
"iPhone 11","Lleg√≥ en muy buen estado, sin rayones ni nada, eso si el cargador no es original hay que comprarse uno. Tra√≠a el 85% de bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11","Bought this for a Christmas Gift. Works and looks great. I ordered a second one and they were three small pinhead scratches on the edges. There was a long scratch along the back but not bad. The Sim card tray was a little hard to get out. The phone itself works very good and for the price I can‚Äôt complain. I would have posted pictures but Amazon of course wants access to all your photos which they don‚Äôt need. What I purchase another phone if I had to? Yes"
"iPhone 11","Llego en muy buenas condiciones y r√°pido, llevo un mes con √©l y ninguna falla"
"iPhone 11","Recib√≠ el producto en excelente estado, en una caja gen√©rica. Todo funciona a la perfecci√≥n. Tiene un peque√±o rasp√≥n en la carcasa, pero es casi imperceptible. La vida de la bater√≠a est√° al 85%."
"iPhone 11","Es una verg√ºenza que vendan un producto con 79% de nivel de bateria"
"iPhone 11","Me gusta que nunca falla, todo funciona muy bien"
"iPhone 11","Other than the battery issue the phone appears to be working properly. Battery error appeared shortly after I started using the phone stating the battery wasn't a genuine iphone battery. I contacted the seller and they did not respond in any meaningful way. Fortunately for me the error has disappeared just as mysteriously but I feel a battery is a pretty crucial component for a cell phone reflecting it's rating."
"iPhone 11","Si vas comprar un producto reacondicionado no esperes un equipo perfecto.El vendedor ofrece un producto seminuevo.Me encanto mi compra, realmente es lo que esperaba, buena relaci√≥n calidad precio."
"iPhone 11","Hola!! No ven√≠a la llave para la SIM. La pantalla viene rayada pero parece que todo lo dem√°s funciona bien."
"iPhone 11","La verdad estoy muy satisfecho est√©tica 9.9 solo unos raspones microscopicos alrededor de la lente de una c√°mara literal ni se nota ni afecta en nada la bater√≠a me llego al 92% llevo 1 mes con el equipo y me siento satisfecho con la compra. Recomendado. Obvio el cargador y accesorios son gen√©ricos pero vale la pena invertirle por aparte a un cargador original para no da√±ar el equipo"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","everything arrives as described
the battery at 100% life
no bumps or scratches
all in order"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro Premium thinking I had eliminated all the problems associated with buying a used phone. The ""Premium"" in the purchase was a promise of a cosmetically excellent iPhone with a one-year guarantee and a minimum battery health of 90%. Well, therein lies the rub. The exterior of the phone was excellent but upon checking the battery health I found it to be 87%. I might have been willing to accept it, but I noticed on the inspection card that all items had been checked off including the 90% battery health, but the card had not been signed or initialed. I started thinking about what else had not been checked so I boxed it up and sent it back. I'll try it again because I believe that one person doesn't make or break a company."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","When my phone arrived it was flawless, not a scratch or scuff. The phone was easy to setup and the price was well worth it."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","My first iPhone coming from a Galaxy 9+ and I‚Äôve been loving it. The battery life is great, health came in at 97% and despite me being an avid social media user, it stays charged all day. It had some tiny scratches on the sides but I didn‚Äôt mind cause it was used. I got screen protectors and a few cases and I LOVE IT."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Phone is amazing, came quickly looked like new and runs like new"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Beats buying a brand new phone considering Amazon's warranty and customer service"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Me encanta. Llego r√°pido y en la caja nuevo. Parece que lo compr√© en un lugar official."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Great seller ! Item functions as described. Original quality iphone 12 Pro Max! Great IOS simple to navigate and use. The IOS ecosystem is good for those who prefer Apple products from ipads to Apple watch or Airpods."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","So I first had ordered this phone but it was only renewed, I got the phone and it was in bad shape, so I returned it. Then I came across Amazon renewed premium so I decided to give it one more shot. They promised that the batter life would be above 90% so I took a chance. I was absolutely blown away, when I got the phone all setup I viewed the battery health and it was 100%! Super happy with this phone and I saved around $250 compared to buying it brand new!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","El producto est√° como nuevo"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","It seems like a pretty functional phone.. appears to work well in most capacities other than the battery, which is right off the bat draining very quickly with very mild usage. (Was assured to be at 90+%)(the last refurbished iPhone I bought came at 98% and after 2 years of usage is at 92%) So it‚Äôs a bit of a bummer because I‚Äôm just going to have to get the battery replaced soon. I honestly might just exchange the phone soon, just throughout writing this review the battery has drained 7%‚Ä¶. That is terrible in my opinion."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This is what I was looking for and will probably get the next version next year"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","love"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","After deciding I wanted to upgrade my phone I figured that going the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù direction was the most affordable option. I must say I was very hesitant at first. Even when I got the device, the plastic on it gave the impression it was banged up and the screen possibly cracked. Luckily for me I realized it was just the plastic, and after removing the phone looked as though it came straight out the apple store. It works just as good as well. All in all so far I think it was a great purchase."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This iPhone works like it‚Äôs brand new. If you are looking for a phone like this Buy it. Everything works as it should. Love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Face Recognition works great but read that it is too easy to replicate so I don‚Äôt use it. Prefer fingerprint recognition. Other than that the phone is great."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I think all iPhones are great phones-long time user here. I specifically wanted a 12 Pro Max; tried the 13 Pro Max from Apple Store & felt it was too heavy. This model just right and has almost all same features as the new 13. Hard to find locally to purchase, and the Renewed Premium is just like a new phone. Battery maximum capacity on it is 99% and body looks flawless! Definitely worth purchasing a Renewed Premium."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Soooo I‚Äôm originally a Samsung type a girl but my kids kept pressing me to try IPhone and I brought the 12 pro max, the phone over all is a great phone. It has face recognition for all my apps and purchases. My battery life is excellent also it will stay charged all day. The phone also came clean and with a cord and wall charger. I‚Äôve had it little over a month and so far so good it came with a yr warranty, so I‚Äôm very pleased with this buy"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Packaging was nice"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","this phone is absolutely perfect!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I bought this iPhone 12 Max because it was advertised as ""unlocked"". I received it and installed it on my TMoble account. However, it would struggle to get onto the network and stay on it. I took it to TMobile and they gave me a new SIM card and the phone still struggled to find the network. As it turned out, the phone always looked for an AT&T network. This phone was also previously an AT&T phone per the codes in the phone's identification information. No matter how many times I selected the TMobile network it always switched back to the AT&T network and hence the phone was unreliable with connecting and staying on the network."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Alot of scratches on the front screen, and the phone had icloud locked by previous owner. Great job for a thousand dollars phone . And sure it been tested by professional technicians before it's going to your hand lol ."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered this phone in plenty of time, weeks before my son would get home on leave from the army. Got it charged up, & when he arrived we went to the Verizon store to get it activated. Turns out it was a locked phone, even though Amazon advertised it as an UNLOCKED phone right in the item description. Horrible. Waste of my time, and now we may not have time to get him another phone before he leaves. Amazon screwed this up entirely."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This phone has major sound issues I feel like I bought a broken phone. It does not have sound sometimes. I don‚Äôt think you should buy from these people. I tried to return it and I never got a response. I d give them no stars if possible"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Came home was happy I got it went to update it then all a sudden keeps restarting n wont stop"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This renewed premium ""like new"" iPhone was nothing of the sort. It had three defects in the screen, one of which was as big as the head of a match! Avoid this seller."

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Title of review are words spoken by my older brother. In spite of the fact that this iPhone was ‚Äúrenewed,‚Äù my brother never mentioned this fact to me because for him it‚Äôs brand new. He is totally obsessed with all apps, cameras, ease of use, sound quality, and Pacific Blue color. Tremendous battery life and 256GB storage are awesome! I absolutely agree with my brother because I own the same phone in Silver. If you‚Äôre concerned that this phone isn‚Äôt compatible with the AT&T mobile network, DON‚ÄôT BE!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I reviewed the product and it looks good without any physical damage, I did not get the original charger but that is not a big deal. I will update this review based on how this iPhone works in the next couple of months but I would recommend to buy"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I upgraded from an iPhone 8 to use as my work phone. The speed and performance upgrades are super noticeable, and the battery life is in a whole new world.

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Primera vez que compro un equipo renovado. No sab√≠a que esperar. En Apple resulta que los equipos RENOVADOS PREMIUM son mejores y tienen una garant√≠a m√°s larga que los No Premium. Este tel√©fono que compr√© ven√≠a en una caja blanca con verde de AMAZON y en el interior un cable y cargador gen√©ricos. Al remover la protecci√≥n de pl√°stico del tel√©fono, mi sorpresa fue encontrar un equipo PR√ÅCTICAMENTE NUEVO. Ning√∫n golpe ni marca de otro tipo. Lo √∫nico que encontr√© (y porque le estuve buscando algo) una rayita diminuta en la pantalla junto al marco. Raya superficial de unos dos mil√≠metros‚Ä¶ La bater√≠a est√° al 91% y al encenderlo de inmediato se actualizo el sistema operativo a IOS 16.1.2
TODO, todo funciona muy bien. No se nota la diferencia entre un equipo nuevo y este. Definitivamente, es una Excelente inversi√≥n y decisi√≥n ir por este equipo."

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ con menos de 90% de bater√≠a y con el certificado que dice que si la tiene, adem√°s de que la bocina de abajo vino rota y todos los botones y altavoces llenos de tierra eso quiere decir que ni siquiera le hacen una limpieza, no me quisieron devolver ni siquiera el dinero de la reparaci√≥n de la bocina y los accesorios que trae como el cargador son de la calidad m√°s baja posible; solo el cable es mfi el cubo estaba m√°s chafa que nada."

"iPhone 12 Pro","This phone was a good purchase and value for money."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Usually the term refurbished and renewed scares people and right fully so. There are many sellers online that sell junk. If you carefully research the seller, you can have a great experience and save LOTS of $$. I bought this iPhone 12 Pro from Mobile Supply on AMZ and the phone was excellent! It honestly looked brand new. The seller was prompt and courteous on communication.
I have bought other Renewed items on AMZ and have had good experiences, but I would check out the seller each time."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Super fast delivery. Product delivered ahead of schedule. Good quality."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Nice clean pretty much like new very satisfied"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Good product with very good customer service"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I‚Äôm a little annoyed that the price dropped from $696 to $629 a couple days after ordering but I guess my timing was off with the 14 coming out. Battery health is at 90% but otherwise the phone is like new. Camera is such a step up from my XR! Definitely faster and I have better signal with the 5G. Happy with my purchase just wish I got a better deal. Comes with an extra charger which is nice because Apple does not include chargers anymore."
"iPhone 12 Pro","**Edit** 10/12/2022:

This phone's battery has now decreased to 96% since my last update a week ago. I lowered to 3 stars from 4 stars as this phone seems to be degrading fast!

------
Ordered this phone as a cost effective alternative to the 13 and/or 14 as the features and ""Bells and Whistles"". Was forced to update my previous device as the iPhone 7 no longer supports iOS 16 :-(

Thoughts on this order/process:

Pros:

-Looks brand new
-Faster than my iPhone 7 ;-)
-Camera is awesome
-Battery Life (con below) was received at 98%!
-Fast, seamless setup.
-Unlocked and Not T-Mobile (which I originally ordered)
-Came with charger cord/adapter
-Fast delivery
-Apple certified parts validated in settings (screen, etc.)

Cons:

-Battery life went to 97% after one week of use?! That makes me very nervous.
-There were some dings I found on the outer edge of the phone in 4 places-No biggie as there's a cover on it now.
-Wish there was an option for T-mobile vs. Unlocked. Apparently, there are multiple sellers on this product and even though I chose ""T-mobile"" I received ""Unlocked"" which is fine, but I paid more for the T-mobile vs. another seller that was a cheaper ""Unlocked"" option.

Other than that I'd rate this purchase 4-4.5. I will update accordingly as I progress with the life of this device. I'm just so happy to be upgraded to a newer iPhone!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone looks and works perfect."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Like new condition, everything works! Love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It‚Äôs like a brand new phone!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone arrived and was already powered on, which was strange. Came FILTHY. Gross caked on crud around the volume on/off switch, the speakers, and battery port so you knew the previous owner had a case on it. Tried to clean it because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was dirty or scratched but the gold edges were very scratched and chipped. Couple of scratches on the cameras. Didn‚Äôt activate phone so can‚Äôt say if this effects it yet. The price went down so I‚Äôve ordered a second one. Whichever is least-worse I guess I‚Äôll deal with. Will update."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was very skeptical buying a refurbished phone but I am so happy I did! This phone is so amazing! There isn‚Äôt a single scratch on it and the battery life is even at 90%! Worth the money 100%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Face recognition was on point . And battery life has been good . Way better than my old XR."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Todo bien pero una de las salidas de sonido ya no se escucha y por lo que vi a la mayor√≠a le toc√≥ la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a mayor a 95% y eso que compre la versi√≥n renovada en excelente estado‚Ä¶ es recomendable comprar l versi√≥n en medio y no la excelente porque no le veo diferencia‚Ä¶ puedo regresarlo hasta noviembre ah√≠ veo que tal va x 1 mes pero por el momento todo bien‚Ä¶"

"iPhone 12 Pro","I was a bit skeptical about this company given some of the reviews but I‚Äôm so glad I took the chance. 2 things that shocked me was that the battery life is 100% and the phone came with a screen protector already on it, a new usb type c charging block and cable along with a pop socket. No regrets!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente producto, lleg√≥ exactamente con todas sus descripciones de venta. Acertada inversi√≥n. Recomendado!!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Looks and works like new. No scratches or anything"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Love the phone. Been wanting it since it came out and finally put some money together to buy it. I do must say I‚Äôm happy to be back with iPhone. I was stuck with a Motorola G4 for almost a year and a half and that phone took a beaten and I finally got tired of it lagging and been a bit of an annoyance to navigate. This phone is clean, sturdy, and very well put together. Love the cameras, I blew my friends mind when I showed him it could take pictures in the dark on SELFIE mode. Even for a refurbished phone it still looks brand new, no dings nor scratches. Looked very clean and smooth when I unwrapped it. And yea unwrapped it. Would‚Äôve prefer getting the whole ‚Äúbrand new fresh off the box‚Äù experience. But I‚Äôm not complaining. They secured it pretty well. Package might not be filled with bubble wrap but this phone is durable. All they needed was to wrap it around with some foam and the phone got to me in one piece, looked brand new. Didn‚Äôt even have to squint my eye I swear.
Side note I didn‚Äôt put a rating on the finger print because I do not know whether this phone has one. I haven‚Äôt bothered the face recognition is enough. It won‚Äôt rwcognize your face with a mask on (obviously) but it does recognize from all kinds of angles. Literally even as far as your arms can reach. I‚Äôve gotten myself an Apple Watch lately the 7 specifically and they go hand in hand love them both. I‚Äôve had the phone for 4 months now and it still looks brand new, I still take it out of the case and feel it. I did spent a grand on it, which for a lot of people it is pretty pricy but so far I haven‚Äôt had a complain or a regret for buying a thousand dollar phone. Which was a HUGE thing before I bought it. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm finally back with iPhone money doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre happy really.
Camera is crisp btw."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone smaller than desired..."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The refurbish condition of the product is as advertised, so I'm happy with it."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone 12 Pro I ordered is perfect! No issues, just had to pop my SIM card in! All functionality works as expected! Great product, Great Price!!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","El tel√©fono aspecto exterior genial, la bater√≠a para cambiar, al ser un m√≥vil preowned esperas que el resultado sea mejor que uno solo re acondicionado. No merece la pena"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Que llego a tiempo y muy buen tel."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Tengo el telefono ya 3 meses y hasta ahora todo esta perfecto. Lo utilizo en Ecuador y sirve bien con mi operadora. Entregado en caja generica, cable y cubo genericos de buena calidad. Nivel estetico 9/10 ya que la pantalla si muestra simbolos de uso y rasgpones menores.Finalmente para ser un telefono del 2020 es bastante costoso."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Es mucho mejor que comprarlo por all√≠, arriesg√°ndose a una estafa"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Cre√≠ que era m√°s grande."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Good product"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone works good no problems speakers loud üëäüèΩ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using to type this up"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great phone with no issues on the phone. The phone charger didn‚Äôt work, as it was probably a refurb too. The cost was a little high, but the phone was like new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was happy with the item , but I had some issue with it , but we work it out successfully .the seller refunded me quicklythank you"
"iPhone 12 Pro","i Have not use it yet , because it has a small but deep scratch on the left side of it that why i do not know how it work. I might keep it for XM gift."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I have been buying Amazon refurbished devices for years and have always gotten great products. This phone was no exception. The time the phone shipped to me was super short. It did make me nervous when the phone didn't come in the Apple box, the phone was in mint condition. I also loved that there were screen protectors on the phone and a charger with the box. I have been putting this phone through the ringer and it is still great. Overall I would totally recommend getting this phone and I love mine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","This is my first iPhone bought by myself i worked for it and ummm I‚Äôm not going to lie I mean to purchase the Pro Max BUT I accidentally bought the Pro only so yup there it is But I must say the phone is still amazing and looks so nice like if I would‚Äôve bought it from the apple store it had 100% battery life is 512GB that‚Äôs so good to have that much space to install how many games or videos I‚Äôd like and still have a toon of space overall I totally recommend this phone to anybody and it‚Äôs a great start before you get to the 13 Pro or Pro max because you don‚Äôt value stuff if you didn‚Äôt have something worse or less valuable before that definitely worth every penny."
"iPhone 12 Pro","When trying to activate the phone, I went to my carriers local store and tried to have the store person install my SIM card for me since my previous phone was destroyed. Once I arrived to the store, the store person starts to explain that when my sim is inserted that the phone‚Äôs sim was locked to a carrier. That confused me cause i clearly bought an unlocked phone so I reached out to customer service. At first, they didn‚Äôt even address the fact that I couldn‚Äôt activate the phone cause even when I clicked on the carrier locked option in the settings, it said that I had to contact the cell phone provider since it was locked to a carrier. They even tried to send a link to me to try to contact them from a different website when we already had an amazon chat opened ?? Definitely got frustrated before customer service finally got back to me & showed how the phone sent was compatible for my cell provider by checking the IMEI in the settings. Thankfully the phone is finally working!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","There are two Big risks on the screen, then its a Good Condition phone, its not Excellent to me."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Pretty good refurbish. Everything really looks brand new. No scratches or marks on any of the surfaces and very clean glass. It was packaged well and arrived in good condition. My only complaint is that it arrived a little dirty. If you are buying this you might want to purchase a phone cleaner as well. While the screen and other surfaces were clean the speakers and charging port had dirt and lint inside that need to be cleaned."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente"
"iPhone 12 Pro","the product came with no scratches and no damage at all but after a day of owning I discovered that the top speaker was not working"
"iPhone 12 Pro","My daughter is enjoying the iPhone 12. We had no problems with integration to Tmobile."
"iPhone 12 Pro","El encabezado del anuncio dec√≠a que se trataba de un 12 pro Max y a la hora de recibir el paquete lleg√≥ un 12 pro"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I had some doubts since this was not the super premium quality of renewed phone but it looks as new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Not original charger but I‚Äôll live def worth the savings will update if anything happens"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The screen was not original"
"iPhone 12 Pro","One camera lens appeared to have moisture/condensation inside, which made (3-4) watermarks/bubbles appear on the pictures."
"iPhone 12 Pro","La bater√≠a ha funcionado genial, estado del 100%, no ten√≠a ning√∫n rasp√≥n ni nada, el color es hermoso y la c√°mara incre√≠ble. Solo no me gust√≥ que el cargador no vino con el c√∫bito y el cable da√±ado"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It came early, and well packaged. And looks brand new. It‚Äôs definitely worth the money."
"iPhone 12 Pro","It's the first time I ordered a refurbished phone, and the quality of the device is way better than I thought. iPhone has solid software and design. I compared it with my old 7...in a nutshell, the Size is comparable, the home button is missing, and the camera was added. Switching between the two generations was difficult due to the missing home button, but after a day, I'm almost stopping to press on the display... Face id works brilliantly. Even recognized me with glasses in the car"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone come along with charging cable, Nice pakaging but charging cable are not working"
"iPhone 12 Pro","mala calidad de la pantalla"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought 2 copies, a Blue one and a Space Gray. The blue one arrived with a small scratch on the surface (not on the screen), but with 100% battery capacity. The gray one, arrived in perfect shape (no scratches anywhere) but with 88% of battery capacity.It is what you are buying, a Renewed phone, not new, not used, somewhere in the middle and is certainly a gamble. They both are working perfectly and have no other flaws, i would give the product in general 8 out of 10, and would recommend it."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Good condition but battery doesn‚Äôt last much longer than my 2y old 11pro"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone 12 Pro is in over all good Condition but the battery Health is only at 90%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is in a great condition, it would have been perfect if the charger cable was in a better quality"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this refurbished. It looks brand new and works perfectly fine. In fact, it was so new you that it still came with the option to purchase AppleCare."
"iPhone 12 Pro","El tel√©fono funciona muy bien, es un excelente tel√©fono sin desperfectos est√©ticos, pero con un detalle que esperaba no lo tuviera pero lo tuvo‚Ä¶ la bater√≠a en condici√≥n de un 91%, un detalle."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Battery health is only 82%, not great"
"iPhone 12 Pro","El celular est√°n en muy buen estado pero, el encabezado del anuncio de este iPhone dice que es un 12 Pro Max (6,7 pulgadas), pero al recibirlo en realidad llega un 12 Pro (6,1 pulgadas)... Y para mi eso es enga√±o!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Hello, I first would like to say thank you for the timely shipping. However, I am not too impressed with the phone. I purchased from this seller specifically because of the reviews but it seems as if I got a bad phone. The front face of the phone is scratched to the top. The battery health is 88% and upon getting the turning on the phone it was dim, turned up the brightness still dim barely can see. This resulted with me taking it to the Apple Store and having them take a look. They told me it‚Äôs either software issue or a problem with the phone. I spent the money for an excellent condition phone and I‚Äôm not getting this"
"iPhone 12 Pro","My phone came with 100% battery capacity, no perceivable external damage. It was almost like new. Currently trouble shooting my phone crashing in video mode. Will up my stars if the issue gets resolved."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Exactly as described. Arrived with no damage and unlocked allowing smooth transition to a new phone!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I received my new phone yesterday and was delivered as promised. Arrived in excellent condition with a battery health of 100% which is far better than promised. So far, I'm working thru the learning curve, but set up was a breeze."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I love it because it it just like a brand new iPhone and it‚Äôs fully unlocked and you pay not as much"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Only had it for a few days, but everything works and it seems to hold a charge well. The phone itself looks like new aside from the tiniest, hair-thin scratch on the bottom right corner of the screen. But honestly, you can‚Äôt even see it and it might have been from me lol so I‚Äôm not counting it as damage. Overall, really nice phone for the refurbished price."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great value for the price."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this phone in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. Got it in the mail and went through the whole process of setting it up & transferring all of my information off my other phone. My husband calls me on it and the speaker doesn‚Äôt work!!! The phone is broken! You can barely hear the other person on the other end talk! How in the world do you let someone spend almost $600 on a phone that doesn‚Äôt even work!!! Very disappointing! Now I have to go through the whole process of returning and waiting for another phone."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Prior to me purchasing this product the reviews had me second guessing my decisions but after receiving my package i promise you all that it is worth it maybe i got lucky but despite all that i would definitely recommend purchasing commodities from trademore keep up the good job!!!-Jordi-Jovane"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Something wrong with the speaker"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone came as shown which was great, but the phone was locked so we couldn't use the phone no matter what we did. We tried to trouble shoot the phone to have the phone unlocked and we even found out that Verizon was the original carrier and called over to Verizon to unlock the phone and they couldn't unlock the phone. We liked the phone and wanted to keep it, but we were not able to as the phone was locked even though we were told it was unlocked. If we were able to use the phone and it was truly unlocked, I am confident we would have loved the phone and would have had no problems"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Works just as described"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It didn‚Äôt take long for the package to come, about 2 to 3 days. When it arrived, the phone looked like it was in perfect condition. Battery life was 94%, i recommend this product!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I am totally disappointed. I paid about $800 and expected the ‚Äùrenewed‚Äù phone at least look complete. But there are scratches all over the phone and the top half of the screen is broken.I spent a day using it and tried to accept the fact. But cracks on the screen seriously affect the feelings of use. I'm going to buy a brand new phone and using this as a backup."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is okay all around except for the battery. Battery life is horrible and it came with a battery health of 86 which is almost the recommended replace number I think it should have had a replaced battery as apart of the refurbish but that clearly did not happen very dissatisfied with that but others then that the phone works well and everything else seems to be good but if battery life is important this may not be for you."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The product is brand new. Aside from the battery percentage being 87%, it cosmetically has no wear and tear at all, because I assume it had a really good case on it prior. Definitely a great purchase for 700$. The battery being that way does not change anything drastically for the potential trade in value of the phone anyways so if you‚Äôre looking in to a renewed phone you should have great luck. If you don‚Äôt, return it and simply get different phone and it will be assured quality."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Shipping was super fast, next day delivery. Battery life was very good (99%) and there was no obvious scratch. It has been more than a month since I got it, and everything is fine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","When the phone arrived it arrived in excellent condition! It had no cracks or scratches, and it had 97% battery life. The shipping is 2 days although my package arrived a little late because of the holiday. The customer service is great and I had someone to answer all my questions right away! Shop with this seller, everything is a 10/10"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was already logged in with a diagnostic app open, and the app showed that one of the cameras failed the test. The telephoto camera didn‚Äôt work and the phone said it detected a non-genuine apple camera. The battery health was also at 93%, which isn‚Äôt like-new. The only upside was that the body wasn‚Äôt scratched and did look like-new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Battery life was 92% which means I've only had to charge every other day. No scratches or marks on phone."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone was in pristine condition, but the phone was NOT unlocked to all carriers, I called Apple and I called my carrier, nothing could be done. Could even find the previous carrier . Sim NOR e sim worked. I‚Äôve bought refurbished/unlocked phones from Amazon before, this is the FIRST time the phone was locked by carrier, will be returning for a FULL refundüî•"
"iPhone 12 Pro","the camera did not worked properly, ill be filing for a devolution"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I have had good results with this purchase. Transfer of my information from my phone to this purchase was good, face recognition is good, no scratches or dings, battery life as described and I am pleased with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I heard that this phone is perfect especially for people who like taking pictures. I am very sorry that I have to return it at this time.I have only opened the packet and examined the phone. I have never turned it on. I did not input any information either. The only reason I entered a 3-star rating is because that goes either way.Thank you for your understanding."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Personal use"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It‚Äôs a fine iPhone. I‚Äôm having a few issues with it, however. The GPS sometimes just doesn‚Äôt work (loses where I am when I‚Äôm using google maps or Waze). Also, the camera and flashlight buttons on the home screen sometimes do not work. I press the flashlight, for example, and the button appears to be pressed but the light doesn‚Äôt turn on. For the camera, the screen will just turn black. Otherwise it works fine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was very good overall and the battery health was 100% but the screws of the phone were missing. You lost a star dude."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I've included photos of how the phone came and a water bottle for size reference. Overall, I'm pleased with my product. It came with a generic charger and surprisingly a SIM card tool opener. The phone arrived in like-new condition and the battery optimization was 92%. I easily transferred the SIM card from my old phone to the new one and set it up with my phone carrier with no problems."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Everything was great and transferred over. My only complaint was the face recognition didn‚Äôt work. Other than that everything was fine"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Sometimes the iPhone 12 Pro is hard to leave a page.When the go back charactfis not present or a"
"iPhone 12 Pro","para remplazar mi celular anterior."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phones looked fairly new with a tiny scratch on one. Battery life is at 91% and 89% on the two phones. This is a decent way to get recent technology at a reduced rate."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I like the product and it works like a new phone. The only negativity was the shipping took long after it got to FedEx facility in the city."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded.

"iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The battery is on the downside but the iphone is in awesome condition"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Really good for its price. Battery isn‚Äôt horrible I was worried about the battery but I‚Äôm honestly suprised. (I‚Äôm not getting paid for my review)"
"iPhone 12 Pro","More Information on working conditions and transparency on major repairs of the phone (such as replacing camera etc). I found out by chance that major repairs were done to the phone. Too much emphasis on ‚Äòhow‚Äô the phone looks. Had I known in advance of the major repairs I would not have bought the phone. Price difference from new to renewed is too close."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Overall it was a great value. The battery health was as advertised (greater than 80%). It was 88% to be exact. The phone looks and works great."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is surprisingly in good condition. I‚Äôm shocked."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great improvement with the addition of ""raw"" photos. Possibilities are endless."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I ordered this item by mistake. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good product."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Just got my phone and it came exactly how I expected. Battery 90%! Completely unlocked because I live in Aruba! Just out my sim in and readyyyy!One minor scratch but you have to look really hard to find it. I guess I‚Äôm luckyü•≥So happy I bought it!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Fast shipping, great product and accesories. No complains. Exactly what I ordered"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone actually came in before the date it was due."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Definitely worth the money, works like new but the battery life is not what a new iPhones should be. Otherwise I‚Äôd highly recommend!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought two of these phones, for my husband and I, with high hopes. One was fine, my only complaint for that one is that the battery is at 86%, but not noticeable.The second one was a disaster. Was fine when I first started it up, but then as I was setting it up I noticed that one of the back cameras was badly cracked. Now this wasn‚Äôt visible from the outside, but it was spiderwebbing cracked across two of the 3 cameras. Also, I got a warning pretty quickly by the phone that the screen was a third party screen and installed improperly. I went to the Apple Store and they said the best thing was to return it and just get my money back.I‚Äôm severely disappointed because now I have to go through the hassle of returning it as well as try and get a replacement. Not happy."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Awesome iPhone, came like new, no to not visible scratches. I got it connected right away with my provider without any problem. Face recognition, extraordinaire. Battery life, pretty descent to handle all those features and last about 24 hours. Great technology is expensive, so, the price is acceptable for an item that is almost perfect."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The back of the phone was not glass. It was replaced, nowhere in the description stated this."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The look, feel, and performance of this iPhone 12 Pro is in no way distinguishable from a new one. Not a single scratch, blemish, dent, or scuff on this phone. I would think all electronics from this seller are in perfect condition. Battery life is 96%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","No scratches no marks no scuffs and battery health was 100% phone was like brand new‚Ä¶. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt up to par is it didn‚Äôt come with an original charging block but that‚Äôs a very small issue if any issue at all"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I just got my phone and when I opened the box I saw the phone is already cracked. I didn't say anything until I saw the dirt inside the speakers, I was speechless... I put the phone to charge an hour ago and it's still on RED!!! I WANT REFUND ON MY ACCOUT!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It‚Äôs a great phone but my phone back camera is having problems. My 12 Pro came in March 17 ,22 I don‚Äôt know why the camera doesn‚Äôt wanna focus it‚Äôs like trying to focus , but it‚Äôs shaking at the same time and making noises but if you zoom in or have wide view it doesn‚Äôt do that."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Some scratches on the screen. I bought it for my uncle but he doesn't pay attention to that kind of stuff. The main thing it's a working phone."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Not sure what is up with this phone but it is the absolute slowest I have ever experienced. I thought that by ordering the 512G I would have a much faster loading time. I am wondering what is wrong with it. Even when I am connected to WiFi it takes 3-5 minutes to load internet browser pages. Not impressed at all & now have all my info loaded onto a phone that I am not satisfied or happy with."
"iPhone 12 Pro","the phone has a warranty and it came with a charger box and apple wire"
"iPhone 12 Pro","For a renewed phone this is awesome! works perfectly no flaws battery is AWSOME! if i could give one piece of advice to the seller 86 FEDEX not the best haha but aside from the that the phone is a 10 out of 10 thank you!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Looks like a new one... Works perfect and has no scratches"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I amazed really fast shipping by Fedex. I got my phone with excellent cosmetics codition and battely life was 92%.I am so satisfied with it. Thank you!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Bought this phone since my other phone was broken. The appearance of it is great. Set it up and the camera option goes black. Contacted seller, but the suggested troubleshooting offered I had already done. Nothing fixed it! In addition, I can process a refund and return the phone which will leave me without a phone for over week. I need a phone with my job! I don‚Äôt recommend buying!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Llego rayado üò°"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was excited to get the new iPhone and willing to pay the amount it cost but then I take it out of the box it came in and it already had minor scratches on the display and It was really off putting I can‚Äôt stop staring at it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It can‚Äôt be updated and shut off every time"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I'm not usually one to make an accusation like that so quickly, but this phone clearly was never inspected by anyone.Here is what is wrong with the device I got: - It cannot hold a charge past 10%, I cannot even complete setup because it requires 20% to update the software. - The charging port only works for one side of the lightning cable, meaning half the time you plug it in you have to flip it around and plug it in again. This iPhone's charging cable is designed to be plugged in either way and still work. - It is dirty and has several chips around where the metal casing and screen meet (not a big deal but it is DEFINITELY visible from any distance you look at it from).I am convinced that this phone was purchased on eBay or something and upsold on Amazon. I am very upset that the $720 I spent on this phone went nowhere and will be expecting a refund."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I‚Äôm incredibly impressed with the quality in price combination. The battery health was over 95%! It arrived on time and looks amazing."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Todo bien, solo que la condici√≥n de la bater√≠as la esperaba al 100%, pero me la trae al 85%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The capacity battery come 91%. I think the come 100%.Awaiting return. Thank you"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone came fast, battery was on zero and came with flimsy charging cord. Everything else looks good, no scratches, unlocked and battery was at 90% health.

"iPhone 12 Pro","I'm truly bummed that this phone didn't work out. My carrier spent hours trying to get their system to port in the phone but couldn't. Their conclusion, based on the error codes they encountered, was that the phone was made for use outside the US and had a manufacturers block on it that couldn't be removed - or maybe fraud. I hesitate to say that but who knows. The good news is that I reported this to Amazon and the device provider just as I described above and the device provider refunded my payment through the Amazon system - no questions asked."

The callers on the other end constantly complain that they cant hear me and its a lot of background noise and at other times, no sound. I can hear them fairly clearly but they have all sort of issues hearing me. This is my second purchase since the first one had cracks on the screen. Dont be like me, make sure that if you do purchase, thoroughly test it before sending it off to Canada as a gift! Save yourself the disappointment and expenses. Avoid these and just put the extra mone and buy from apple refurb or buy New if you can. Take my advice"

I wasn't sure if it was possible to troubleshoot this issue so I called Digital Age USA, but despite claiming they have a ""dedicated customer service staff available 8:30 - 6:30 CST/ 7 days"" no one picked up the phone after 2 attempts during those hours.

"iPhone 12 Pro","Mala apariencia del art√≠culo"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Scam"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I use to be a great fan of amazon renewed phones yet lately it appears quality control is severely lacking. Sometimes I‚Äôve got lucky yet about 50% of the time it‚Äôs been a real hassle activating the phone just to discover immediately or down the road something is defective. On this particular phone the camera didn‚Äôt work from the get go. I‚Äôd press the shutter button and it would click yet a photo would not be taken. Quite frustrating when the sole reason I was upgrading from an 8 plus was for the improved camera.If there is a good deal on a phone because they sell out so quickly you might want to buy 2 to insure that one of them works correctly. Personally, I am really reluctant to purchase another renewed phone because of the time involved setting up the phone only to have to spend more time taking it to a ups store to return it now that amazon doesn‚Äôt provide ups pickup wirhout paying an additional $7.99 for pickup."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Recived mine from a carrier new but coming from a 6s to a 12 is night and day! If your in the market for a decent iOS this is a great choice,my brother has the 12 mini he loves it,I even put aside my SE for this in Colbalt blue <3"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Great phone for being 2 generations behind. The seller is great and helpful for any inquiries!"
"iPhone 12","I received my iPhone 12 in good condition but I could not even set up the phone. Once I choose my country and region it freezes. After searching up some YouTube videos I fixed the problem"
"iPhone 12","My first I-Phone. I thought I would take a chance and purchase refurbished. I was pleasantly impressed. Works great. Nothing wrong with it. Thanks. No regrets."
"iPhone 12","El porcentaje de bater√≠a es aceptable, los otros aspectos cumplieron con mis expectativas"
"iPhone 12","The Phone Came in Perfect Cosmetic Condition. the plastic wrapped in was a bit dirty and the sticker on the camera left a little residue on the phone, which was easily cleaned off. I thought the Renwewd Prenuim meant that the Battery health would be at least 90% or more, but it was 88% the phone. other than that little difference I would repurchase them. bought the phone for a customer. he was pretty happy with it"
"iPhone 12","I ordered the iPhone 12 and not a scratch on it. I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use.

I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%.

Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector.

CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches. Front facing and the two back cameras ....

Overall great purchase."
"iPhone 12","I got my phone like today and I love it so much. I got the black 128gb the battery health is 91% not that bad if you ask me ‚Ä¶ I love my phone so far and I would purchase this again if I have to.. I recommend this to anyone.. there was no scratches and charges well.. thanks seller"
"iPhone 12","It‚Äôs in beautiful condition and everything seems to work great so far. It‚Äôs only the first day I‚Äôve had it, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I got it within a couple days after ordering too, which was a plus."
"iPhone 12","Order 3 phones (2 iPhone 12 and 1 iPhone XR) They were in good condition , Only problem was one of the iPhone 12 had an ear speaker problem. Everything else was good."
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono estaba bien la verdad se miraba impecable lleg√≥ r√°pido .pero al mes dejaron de funcionar las c√°maras y el flash as√≠ que lo devolv√≠ fue dentro de lo que cabe f√°cil la devoluci√≥n y me renbolsaron mi dinero .pero es muy recomendable a mi parecer comprar as√≠ .la verdad muy contento es bueno tener la confianza de que no vas a perder tu dinero"
"iPhone 12","I switched from a Samsung S20. There are some features I miss from that phone, but this phone arguably has better face recognition and battery life. It feels great in your hands and the cameras and iOS environment are solid. Not much to complain about honestly."
"iPhone 12","The ‚Äúgood‚Äù quality isn‚Äôt so good in my opinion. The phone has a ton of faded paint marks around the sides top and bottom of the phone. I‚Äôm not sure if every good quality iPhone is sold like this, but the quality was definitely more deteriorated than I expected. At the same time, the price mark is definitely better than a brand new one."
"iPhone 12","Just had bought the iPhone 12 renewed premium and this phone seems new to me. I couldn‚Äôt find any flaw it had 100% and it works just as new I‚Äôm very happy with this iPhone 12"
"iPhone 12","It showed up faster than expected. It set up faster than expected. It runs twice as fast as my XR. It cost half as much as a new one.

What‚Äôs not to like?"
"iPhone 12","Day one and very happy with the condition of the phone. It is like brand new. The phone arrived a day early. Very happy so far with what I have used it for today. The seller was excellent to work with and offered to let me contact them should I have any other questions."
"iPhone 12","Hi I noticed that on the red iPhone 12 renewed the battery life is at 80%. For as much as they charge for a renewed phone I would think it would be at least 90-95%
Otherwise the phone works great and my son is really happy with it!"
"iPhone 12","There was absolutely no scratches or cracks on the phone the screen and glass were perfect.
Battery life was at 91%.
It was delivered within 2 days and it came with a screen protector and charger.
Basically a new phone and I‚Äôm very satisfied."
"iPhone 12","My ancient 6 plus decided last week that it was just too tired to work anymore. I ordered this iphone 12, and I am So happy with it. It will take a few days to get used to the smaller size, but its such an improvement over the old phone. Its in perfect condition, looks brand new, absolutely no scratches. Has a battery life of 93%, which I am very pleased with. Sometimes you wonder about the refurbished items, but for the prices, I will always take a chance on them. The phone is an Amazon Refurbished one, and they are definitely to be trusted."
"iPhone 12","This is the second iPhone I have purchased through Amazon renewed and they both were basically brand new at a fraction of the cost I would have paid at the store. Love love love my new phone. I even purchased a third one for my husband for Christmas ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 12","Phone came without a scratch & 100% battery life. I'm super impressed. Love love love my new phone."
"iPhone 12","The phone is a great phone definitely an upgrade from my iPhone XR. Camera is much better and so is the processor. However, I gave it 4 stars because it stated no visible damages, scratches, Etc‚Ä¶noticeable but there are just a few tiny nicks on the sides that I assume are from a case that‚Äôs is not so forgiving when taking on and off. Other than that, Nothing noticeable and the battery life is at 94% which is better than I anticipated. The 5g and quickness is also an upgrade. I believe this phone is great for the money spent compared to other prices I‚Äôve seen and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going for the 14 anytime soon."
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono cumple con las especificaciones que promete Amazon Rewened. Me vino con 85% de bater√≠a, el estado f√≠sico me vino algunos peque√±os rayones, en la pantalla si se notaban mas los rayones pero nada que incomode la pantalla. Desbloqueo y todo bien (Por ahora)"
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","Face Recognition, Battery Life and touch screen works absolutely great!!!!! I was a bit afraid at first due to the phone being a refurbished phone but it came in excellent condition looks absolutely new and works perfect!!! I Love It!!!!"
"iPhone 12","Did not know that Amazon had refurbished iPhones. Great product. Bought as a backup and for use internationally. Completely unlocked for use with any carrier. Great value, battery life, and 90 warranty!"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm disappointed in the battery life. I thought the battery would be new.
One reason I upgraded my phone was battery. I had a iPhone 7plus. I bought it brand new and the battery was starting to drain fast.
I haven‚Äôt tried the face recognition yet."
"iPhone 12","Phone came in fantastic condition. There‚Äôs no dings, scratches, or flaws. Works just as brand new. Battery Health is 95% which is great! So far, so good!"
"iPhone 12","Good battery health at 91% minor cosmetic damage to touch screen. Fully functional and overall a good purchase"

"iPhone 12","it's easy to use and looks amazing"
"iPhone 12","El producto llego como nuevo"
"iPhone 12","Very easy to set up"
"iPhone 12","Got it for a gift for my daughter, she's super happy and loves it. It's fast, came in like new condition, and absolutely worth it."
"iPhone 12","I love this product I have been using it for a couple months and it has served me well and I spend a large amount of my time on my phone."
"iPhone 12","Love the product as advertised just wish the phone was larger"
"iPhone 12","Phone came in very good condition. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that it came with 87% battery life."
"iPhone 12","excelente estado"
"iPhone 12","I love the phone. Works like a champ but the driver delivered it to the building next-door and I had to go retrieve it myself."
"iPhone 12","GREAT PRICE VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE"
"iPhone 12","The spouse needed a new iPhone to replace the old iPhone 6 SE Apple that won't even update anymore. Years ago we replaced the battery on the old one and it was getting weak again, so it was way past time.

I was glad the refurbished unit I received was exactly as described. The battery shows 88% life left, decently over the promised value. I saw minor scratches in the metal but nothing really noticeable. I ordered a case and glass screen protector and you can't even tell it's not brand new.

The size of the phone is slightly taller and wider than the old 6 SE, so it seems familiar, but the face of the screen is MUCH larger, making it more usable. It works very similarly to the old phone, except for having no physical home button. The home gestures work easily and the setup had everything PLUS updates making all the old apps work, so the spouse was quite happy.

I, too, was happy doing ""tech support,"" because Apple does all the heavy lifting. Just kick off a backup to iCloud on the old phone (in case something goes wrong). When the backup finishes, move the SIM card to the new phone and turn it on. Set the new phone next to the old one, and follow the prompts. The data comes across and much of the setup will be just as expected.

I think if you're getting an Apple phone, a recent model certified refurbished phone is a good way to save a bit of money."
"iPhone 12","Fantastic phone - like new. I have been using it for a while now and had no issues. I would recommend anyone go with this seller."
"iPhone 12","iPhone 12 arrived almost fully charged so that was nice, every piece of hardware on the phone worked and passed diagnostic tests. Has a few tiny nicks around the cameras but the screen is flawless. Battery had 87% out of 100% capacity so I‚Äôll have to replace it sooner rather than later, but isn‚Äôt a huge deal. Overall a fantastic upgrade from my iPhone SE 2020. The OLED screen is just beautiful.

Also, I ended up putting it in a LifeProof Fr√©, at $80 it‚Äôs a pretty penny for a case, but it offers extremely good protection without limiting access to the phone‚Äôs functions. Highly recommend both this phone and said phone case."
"iPhone 12","The product came neatly packaged and it was in better condition than I expected for the price"
"iPhone 12","lo recomiendo 100%, buen estado de la bateria, conserbava su garantia aun por apple, en perfectas condiciones. lo unico esque tardo mucho en llegar. se recomienda al provvedor no enviarlo por usps"
"iPhone 12","Phone Works Perfectly Well‚Ä¶.Only one scuff n its extremely unnoticeable, also came with a screen protector pre-installed‚Ä¶.Amazing value for your money."
"iPhone 12","Genius purchase here with quality care, detailed attention straightforward approach, and grand design in getting what you pay for, Comes with a year to return, comes completely acceptable as like-new, the item is fully functional and is not in anyway meant to be purchased just for money consumption. I got what I paid for and at a closer price than getting a new product, this like new product is way more acceptable. Grab yours today. Also, keep in mind the GB. Storage is essential. I know my 128 will not fail me, go higher if you are a content creator."
"iPhone 12","I love it"
"iPhone 12","CP is not a dual sim phone. Very disappointed."
"iPhone 12","Been an android user for years. Switching to the iphone because I'm going overseas. When I opened the box I noticed the phone had some micro blemishes but nothing to get upset about. I was a little surprised that the phone was charged and ready to go out of the box. Nice! Single Sim; accepted my T-Mobile sim card--no issues. Battery Health was 88%! Pretty good but not as high as others mentioned. Overall, the phone works great! Totally satisfied. Going to purchase another one."
"iPhone 12","The back camera was an illegitimate Apple camera, so I did have to spend some money to replace my camera which sucks, but other than the phone works great.. also my Siri won‚Äôt work lol. but I love the phone overall !"
"iPhone 12","I gotta say I was surprised that the phone looked almost brand new, although the color around the camer were stripping off but that was no big deal because I bought camera lens protector to put around it so there was nothing to complain about. The battery health was at 85% which is very good for a good phone, everything worked fine and I am very pleased with my order. So if you‚Äôre having 2nd thoughts about buying from HYBRID IT, just buy it because this was a great buy. üòÑüëç"
"iPhone 12","Works great,a few minor blemishes,wouldn‚Äôt read my SIM card so I had to take it to my phone provider and they did an eSIM and it worked great.Smaller than I expected,I had an iPhone 7 Plus and it is quite a bit larger than the regular iPhone 12."
"iPhone 12","Perfect"
"iPhone 12","Great seller with fast service. Review 48+hours of use: The device works properly well with fast battery charge, the physical condition of the device could be better, I will buy again from this seller."
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm so lovely"
"iPhone 12","I love this phone! Came with a small dent in the top right corner but it doesn‚Äôt affect the phone and it isn‚Äôt very visible. I‚Äôve had it for about two months and still not a single problem! Although, at this point in time, I would go buy a brand new one from Apple just because you would be its first owner and you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about any scratches or defects. If you do buy this phone, it isn‚Äôt much different from a brand new one."
"iPhone 12","Overall I‚Äôm satisfied thank you!"
"iPhone 12","It‚Äôs good"
"iPhone 12","The refurbished phone was in good shape and still had the glass screen protector. Power adapter and cable were generic, but who doesn't have either of those these days?"
"iPhone 12","Everything about the phone was fine aside from the earpiece speaker not working and the speakers on the bottom only work half the time. Sometimes they randomly cut to half volume even when it‚Äôs turned all the way up. Battery came at 80 something % so not bad."
"iPhone 12","Pretty much, works like new. Thanks for saving me money!"
"iPhone 12","Amazing"
"iPhone 12","Great case. Face recognition excellent. No change to battery life but mag safe makes it easier and quicker to charge battery."
"iPhone 12","Recib√≠ el tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones ,sin un ray√≥n, todo en orden y funcionando perfectamente"
"iPhone 12","I didn‚Äôt expect the phone to come in such excellent condition. Battery at a 100% , not a single scratch or sign of use. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 12","Bought a acceptable iPhone 12 came in really good condition a little dirt in the speakers and a little scratch and at 87% battery life"
"iPhone 12","Phone was like new. Battery Health was 100% and phone was still covered under Apple care for a few months!"
"iPhone 12","I bought two phone 12ÔºåBattery health was at 90 and 95Ôºåeverything else is fine so far"
"iPhone 12","The iPhone works as expected. This was a big upgrade from my previous phone so my expectations were easy to meet. I purchased 1 for myself and one for my wife a month later. My big hang-up with these phone is that they‚Äôre misrepresented by the seller/Amazon. These phones aren‚Äôt ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù, they‚Äôre just ‚Äúused‚Äù iPhones. The phones came to me with a chip in the paint on the back, a scratch on the screen, the battery health at 91%, and the charge port full of gunk that caused the charger to not seat properly. All of these issues are fairly minor to me (once I cleaned out the gunk in the charge port), so as far as the phone is concerned, I‚Äôm fairly content. I‚Äôm mostly just annoyed that Amazon allows sellers to advertise iPhones as ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù when they‚Äôve clearly done nothing to renew it. It‚Äôs just a used iPhone. If you go in knowing it‚Äôs used instead of renewed, you will likely be content with the purchase."
"iPhone 12","lleg√≥ en excelente estado a Ecuador, su funcionamiento es excelente"
"iPhone 12","Got this to give my old phone to someone else and it‚Äôs just good as buying a new one, of course the corners came scratched but with a case on you don‚Äôt even know. Got it turn on with no problems so it‚Äôs unlocked like it says."
"iPhone 12","First time buying a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone. I was happy with my iPhone 6+ but the whole world is 5G. Screen size is just an 1/8 of an inch more narrow, but it is almost an inch taller than my 6+."
"iPhone 12","Battery life faster than expected"
"iPhone 12","External body like a new.
Battery health 89%
Camera and sound ok
Screen with no scratch"
"iPhone 12","Every works just fine, and it looks great"
"iPhone 12","I like the phone. I bought it because it has a Ceramic Shield glass that is 4x better against breaking if dropped.
It is a second hand phone and it has a screen protector on it. This was unknown to me.
There are 4 marks on the screen protector that bug me.
I‚Äôm hoping I can remove the protector."
"iPhone 12","The phone was fully functional. But it has quite a few scratches. I can withstand the scratches on the back, but it had a couple of scratches on the screen."
"iPhone 12","Me gusto"
"iPhone 12","the battery health is at 100% there are no scratches and looks brand new i have no complaints!"
"iPhone 12","The phone is really good, but my only complaint is that the screen had some small but kinda noticeable scratches on the top of the screen. Everything else was perfect, even the battery was at 100%. I would definitely recommend this phone, if you don't mind a little scratches on the screen."
"iPhone 12","There are no scratches or marks on this phone to indicate misuse and the battery measures at 98%. I have only had this phone for a couple of days and so far I‚Äôm loving it."
"iPhone 12","SIM removal tool product missing.
Phone color fade out near back camera. please checkout images.

Requesting to send good condition another phone without any damage."
"iPhone 12","The phone I received was in nearly perfect condition with 100% battery health, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase"
"iPhone 12","Good buy, there‚Äôs a slight cosmetic damage on the top edge of the phone but it doesn‚Äôt show once the case is on, so not a dealbreaker. Battery Health was 100% and lasts long."
"iPhone 12","Battery life was a little low, but everything else is fine."
"iPhone 12","Face recognition battery and touch screen all is in good working condition."
"iPhone 12","Phone freezes at times and glitches but overall I love the color and size of the phone"
"iPhone 12","Awesome"
"iPhone 12","This thing is practically new. VERY minor scratch but other than that, perfect. Definitely worth the risk to buy refurbished."
"iPhone 12","Looks brand new purchased a excellent package I am very satisfied"
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","I loved this phone it came with a charging cord, fast charging box, screen protector, and pop socket. I bought this phone refurbished in acceptable condition but it looks and feels brand new. 10/10 recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12","Very much like a brand new phone. Everything works and was able to get it set up in about 5 minutes. Only two or three knicks that are very small but understand for a refurbished phone. 100% happy with my order. (Haven‚Äôt had it long enough to review the battery life)"
"iPhone 12","Thank you so much for this perfect phone! It came quickly , which I appreciated- but most importantly, the phone is in pristine condition! Literally looks brand new! Not a single scratch, fingerprint, speck of dust- nothing! The battery health capacity is 96%. The set up was easy- although during the iCloud upload, the screen did turn black- I did a hard reset and everything works perfectly again. (quickly press up volume button, then quickly press down volume button, then hold power for 20 seconds until apple icon shows up‚Äî and it will reboot as before).

Amazing quality and value -thank you so much!! I am so glad that I went with a renewed phone rather than a brand new one from Apple. üíôüíôüíô particularly from your company- hybrid IT!"
"iPhone 12","Screen was broken. Screen was also faulty. Waste of time to buy this to have to return."
"iPhone 12","Phone was in great shape but not unlocked for my carrier"
"iPhone 12","The shipment came a day earlier and able to use it within minutes of unboxing it. Facetime and everything worked"
"iPhone 12","My 15 year old son worked this summer to save his money for a new phone. He‚Äôs very cheap and doesn‚Äôt like to spend money at all lol lol lol. Anyway he decided to get this refurbished phone from Amazon.
He got it yesterday and we both were amazed at the condition of it. The phone looks brand new no scratches or anything. It comes with a charging block and cord which a new iPhone doesn‚Äôt even come with a charging block.
Will update in a few wks on battery life and if we have any issues."
"iPhone 12","Dents and scratches on the phone that wasn't specified."
"iPhone 12","If you‚Äôre on a fence about buying a refurbished iPhone don‚Äôt be. This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone purchase and it‚Äôs totally worth every penny where you‚Äôre saving hundreds from other comparable refurbished ones or more than 1/2 of the original new MSRP."
"iPhone 12","My granddaughter loves the phone."
"iPhone 12","Todo bien con el celular esta en excelentes condiciones esteticas no tiene detalles de uso. Lo unico malo el cable con el que me vino la primera vez que lo use se rompi√≥."
"iPhone 12","It came quickly and it works just fine. It was a little weird setting it up but other than that, the battery Life is amazing and everything else is perfect."
"iPhone 12","The ear speaker is filthy. Other than that the phone looks like new. Battery life is 91% which isn‚Äôt horrible."
"iPhone 12","The phone came fast and it was in excellent condition it only had 1 tiny chip on the top that isn't noticeable, battery health was not the best tho it was at 84%"
"iPhone 12","Bought as a secondary phone for my Galaxy S22 Ultra. I bought Acceptable Condition and the only real wear I see is a few paint chips on the aluminum sides, which you can't see unless looking really close. Battery health at 88%. Also came with a preinstalled screen protector. Ended up taking that off since it messes with the facial recognition.

The packaging was quite disappointing. Just came in a USPS small priority box that was damaged, and the phone only had one layer of bubble wrap and was sliding out of it as I opened the box."
"iPhone 12","Slight signs of use but nothing critical or obvious. The bad part is the battery, but even though it has 82% of max capacity it lasts a lot to run out of battery. I'm very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 12","Everything about this phone is good except for the screen. It‚Äôs hard to type and scroll through social media. You have to use your entire finger not just the tip. It‚Äôs really insensitive."
"iPhone 12","The phone itself is great. But the buttons for the power and volume feel stuck most of the time and very hard to turn phone off with and without a case on. I have to press multiple times and forget about taking a snap shot or using the double tap function for wallet."
"iPhone 12","Well. It‚Äôs an iPhone 12. I got what I paid for. A few things though:

-The package did not come with a SIM card tool.
-The battery health was at 87% when I received it. Not cool.
-The phone did, however, come with a free screen protector pre-applied. It wasn‚Äôt applied evenly, but hey, at least it‚Äôs free.

Would buy again for a friend in the end."
"iPhone 12","The phone is mostly ok. The screen has an issue (there is a small area that looks faded one the sceeen is off, noticeable when screen is on), however, biggest issue and why I gave 3 stars is because the Esim is still locked to AT&T, the previous carrier of the phone. Which means I can never have two numbers in this phone. I will contact Amazon about this and update this review based on their response."
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone as reconditioned, but it has performed just like it‚Äôs new so far. I‚Äôm definitely satisfied so far with my iPhone 12."
"iPhone 12","This iphone 12 battery health was less than the 90% they say on the product description. The phone also had a very visible ding on both sides of the power button and to top it all, the return process was much worst than other product. Amazon requires UPS to pick up the item at the address where it was delivered and that cost me a day's work."
"iPhone 12","Received iPhone 12 securely packaged with a new charger and pin to remove sim card. Cosmetically the phone looks great. So far it has been functioning well too. I am hoping this one will last us, our last refurbished phone from a different reseller had issues within a year."
"iPhone 12","Even though the phone did not show up in an Iphone box, you would never guess it was refurbished. No noticeable flaws at all. Came with charger and cord. Best part is the battery life charges to 100%. I ordered this for my teenager who has been asking for an Iphone. No way could I afford a new one and I refuse to be tied to a network contract. Phone came completely unlocked and my teenager is so happy with everything about the phone. I explained that it most likely would not have a battery that charges completely since that is what is stated per Amazon so we are surprised that the battery charges 100%. The pricing I found to be acceptable after doing pricing research. I will be ordering another one in the near future. Thank you"
"iPhone 12","Genuinely yes this was a great phone saves money just like new saw absolutely nothing wrong with it"
"iPhone 12","It‚Äôs alright mine cam with a few scratches on the back and a few on the front. Besides that it‚Äôs prefect. It came with a battery health at 91%. I‚Äôv had it for 2 months now and have still had no issues."
"iPhone 12","My battery life is already 80% not good for an ‚Äúexcellent condition ‚Äú"
"iPhone 12","No Frills, arrived as advertised, phone felt like someone used it for a few months before trading it in for a newer model. Lifelong android user and this was my first iPhone (GSM Carrier). I was able to put my SIM in and my phone was online and working within the hour. Had the phone for a bout a week now and the hardware feels great - I feel confident that the battery is at least at the 80% level that they say it is.

If I have to be picky, there is a minor scratch that can only be seen if the phone is held at a sharp angle to the light. There is also some scuff marks on the sides where the phone was potentially rubbing on something. Both of these extremely minor gripes vanish when I put on a screen protector and a phone case.

Final Verdict: I'm very happy I made this purchase and it was fantastic value. I got over the ""renewed"" feeling pretty quickly, but I can see how that might bother some people."
"iPhone 12","iPhone 12 is, in my mind, ever since 2020, the gold standard for what a smartphone should be. With a beautiful 6.1"" OLED display, A14 Bionic, good battery life, and a good camera, this iPhone has great value and powerful features."
"iPhone 12","So the package finally came and in good condition"
"iPhone 12","iPhone 12, decent condition. Battery life disappoints, some rashes on the edges but overall decent."
"iPhone 12","Only problem i have with it is the charger it came with really bad quality."
"iPhone 12","I ordered a refurbished i 12 which looked good on site but finally not very satisfied once in hand.
Also price don‚Äôt remain competitive ( my bad luck ) as it dropped.
So better to go for new n think for later gains
Just my Opinion
No issues with delivery or Amazon üëçüèª"
"iPhone 12","my phone is next to perfect! i found the tiniest scuff near the camera on the back of the phone, but i really had to hunt to find any imperfections at all. battery at 92% and lasts all day with constant use. speaker sounds great. phone calls are clear. very happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 12","Phone looked as new however, battery health was only 91%. Wish we knew the percentage before purchasing."
"iPhone 12","When we first got the phone the wifi and the Bluetooth didn't work.. after several times of resetting tge network. It randomly turned on."
"iPhone 12","daily use"
"iPhone 12","This was a smooth process and the phone I received is amazing. I highly recommend this company and their product. I bought a ‚ÄúLike new‚Äù phone and it is the closest thing to brand new I‚Äôve seen without opening the box for the first time myself. I will be buying my next phone from here"
"iPhone 12","Stop getting notications and a faulty charger, does not charge properly. I caution anyone who is thinking of getting a refurbished iPhone it's best to pay for a new one. I'm sending my back. Glad these issues manifested its self before the 30 days are up."
"iPhone 12","Muy buen producto vida √∫til de la bater√≠a al 100%"
"iPhone 12","Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the best photo of the phone. Sorry about that. What I will say is, there are absolutely no visible damages to this phone- not on the screen, any of the cameras, the sides or edges, and not on the back. The phone operates like new- and in fact, If I bought it without realizing it was renewed, I would have thought it to be brand new. I think perhaps the only thing is that the sound clarity was iffy at first, but that could have just been me because it is absolutely fine now. I wanted to wait the full 90 days before giving an honest review, but so far everything has been fine. The battery life is superb- it is 6:10 PM now and It‚Äôs battery is at 75% without charging and with a decent amount of use during today. I really am enjoying the phone so far, however if anything changes, I will probably edit this review.
In short, I do believe the purchase was worth it!"
"iPhone 12","Product is in very good shape except for a few minor scratches."
"iPhone 12","I use my phone for pretty much everything and the battery isn‚Äôt bad it does go a bit faster if your using it all day but that‚Äôs any phone"
"iPhone 12","The phone arrived quickly and was good value for the price as I didn‚Äôt want to pay full price for a 2 year old phone. However I did order the wrong storage size therefore returned the product."
"iPhone 12","Hybrid IT is awesome.
Phone was delivers within 24 hours of ordering it. Battery life was @95%. Recommend this seller again. Will purchase from them again for sure. I wish I could give them more that 5 stars. They deserve 10 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è"
"iPhone 12","It looked fine from the packaging but when i started to use it I quickly noticed the flaws. Cant even recognize my sim card nor run cellular network connection. My device doesnt connect to cellular network!!! Like cmon! I wish i could get my money back but i cant! 1 star!"
"iPhone 12","It worked right away, I‚Äôm not entirely used to IPhones so I did have a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to use it. Now that it‚Äôs been nearly a month since I bought it, it works fantastic, the storage is great and I didn‚Äôt even notice any superficial damage like the product says it does. Honestly, I‚Äôd recommend if you want an IPhone but are hesitant, believe me I get you, I‚Äôm certain you can trust this."
"iPhone 12","I ordered a renewed and unlocked iPhone 12 with 128 GB of storage from Amazon. I wanted to try one out (my previous smartphones except for my first one were all Androids). I also wanted the flexibility of paying the phone off when I wanted to instead of being stuck on a ""forever"" installment plan. Buying this phone was a great decision. I love my iPhone. If you're worried that a renewed iPhone won't be as good as a brand new iPhone, don't be. The front of the phone is in pristine shape. The glass on the front has no scratches whatsoever. The back has very few (and I literally mean very few) scratches. You can't see them from arm's length like the listing says. You can barely see them unless you hold it up to a light. The sides of the phone are in perfect shape too. It makes calls, send texts and messages normally. The camera is in perfect shape and takes amazing pictures too. This model of the renewed iPhone costs about 50 bucks less than a brand new one with the same storage. If you're looking for a good value on an iPhone or a replacement phone for a family member then I'd consider a renewed iPhone. Its a winning decision."
"iPhone 12","The I phone 12 arrived quickly but was poorly packed. It was delivered loosely in a bubble sleeve in a box in a plastic mailing envelope. The sleeve was inadequate to keep the phone from rattling around inside the box. The phone was listed as excellent, same as new, but the phone had noticeable scratches on the top area of the screen. Other than those two gripes, the phone otherwise was in excellent shape and was able to be initialized properly. After staring at the screen scratches for a few hours, I decided to return the phone, at my own expense."
"iPhone 12","Iphone 12 arrived on time and in excellent conditions. No scratches on the screen. Battery life runs all day for a teenager boy, so it's a good signal."
"iPhone 12","The phone functions properly I received mine with 89% battery life there is a pretty deep scratch on the screen but overall decent price for the phone"
"iPhone 12","It is a bit hard to open the screen, have to swipe in just the right spot"
"iPhone 12","I was hoping a better battery life since I choose the ""excellent"" condition, also I still can see scratches around the phone."
"iPhone 12","The battery dies really fast. Last night it totally shut off and I couldn‚Äôt turn it back on. That was frustrating. But finally got it working again."
"iPhone 12","Dosent work with boost mobile üò°"
"iPhone 12","Product arrived one day early, only couple small marks in the screen but overall it's better than I expected. A+"
"iPhone 12","I was skeptical at first since it was refurbished I was more worried about battery life, well no problem at all! No one can even tell it was refurbished unless I tell them! I love thank you"
"iPhone 12","El celular es totalmente funcional. Las peladuras y rasgu√±os son casi imperceptibles. Los parlantes ven√≠an un poco sucios. Por todo lo dem√°s est√° muy bien."
"iPhone 12","Apple genuine parts and fast shipping, I love my new phone!"

"iPhone 12","Very good product, battery life 96%, worth"
"iPhone 12","My iphone came quickly and there was no damage to the phone. It even came with a charger, which is super nice. The only thing was the battery wouldn't charge, however after hard resetting the iphone it has had no problem charging, and battery life lasts all day:) here is how to hard reset an iphone if anyone else needs to do it: press the volume up and then the volume down button very fast. Immediately after hold the power button. I'm very happy I chose to purchase through amazon."

"iPhone 12","I always get worried when i see refurbished in the title, but this time i decided to go for it since it was a great prime day deal, and it came 1 day sooner. I got the Iphone 12 green and i was amazed that it looks brand new with only 2 minor scratches on the back. Thats no problem since its going to have a phone case. Overall its a great buy."
"iPhone 12","Product came on time and works perfectly! Don‚Äôt usually buy phones online but this was perfect"
"iPhone 12","All features work perfectly and the housing is in excellent, near new condition. There was one very small knick at the top but was covered by the phone case. Overall a great buy as I was able to save over $200 unlocked and battery life was 90%."
"iPhone 12","The phone is Amazing everything is perfect just that when it was delivered, UPS delivered to the wrong address. Thanks god the person who lives there went to my house and give it to me. Just be careful!"
"iPhone 12","Battery life 89%"
"iPhone 12","Would recommend all the negative comments are strange because mine was just fine"
"iPhone 12","It‚Äôs a iPhone, not much to say, it works"
"iPhone 12","When it arrived it was completely like new, 0 signs of use, and 89% battery health. Face Id works great, everything seems awesome. I'm very impressed, and I look foward to using this phone more in the future"
"iPhone 12","I liked it very well"
"iPhone 12","Unlike some vendors, this phone came on time, packaged correctly and looked exactly as advertised. I do not purchase cell phones regularly, but I would buy from this vendor again!"
"iPhone 12","The clarity of the picture on the phone amazed me"
"iPhone 12","Si"
"iPhone 12","Its very easy to use."
"iPhone 12","This phone purchase was GREAT! Price was reasonable, phone is AMAZING and literally perfect! No issues, even received it earlier than anticipated."
"iPhone 12","Everything works top notch. Face ID, screen , everything! I had no problems at all with these. It has a few scratches on the corners a top and bottom one but for the most part in great condition. Loveeee the color it‚Äôs amazing! It also came with a screen protector‚Ä¶ which im very greatful for !"
"iPhone 12","Charging cable not working, it does not charge the phone. Went to service center and they said, charging cable is not appropriate to charge the phone, i need to buy another one. My only question to seller, why they do this kind of cheap work, where they gave a faulty charging cable. Would not recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12","My phone came with a little dent on the top right but other than that it is perfect. Don‚Äôt even notice it because I have a case on."
"iPhone 12","This phone came in great condition. The only thing was the battery health was in the mid 80s like around 85%. Otherwise, great buy."
"iPhone 12","Wonderful phone beautiful. Mint condition not scratches runs perfect out of the box so far. It's been only a few days and no used it on a regular basis yet but impressive so far"
"iPhone 12","Bought the excellent condition and the phone came with no scratches and no dents, 100% battery health and apple warranty till June 2023"
"iPhone 12","Phone came with a broken ear speaker. For some reason, neither of the speakers were inspected according to the Amazon Renewed ""20-Point Inspection Test Certificate"". There is visible damage to the ear speaker as per the photo attached. These parts should also be tested. The phone cannot be used as a conventional phone with this broken critical part. I will be returning this phone; very disappointing.

Edit: (Adjusted from 1 to 3 stars) Immediately after returning the phone, I purchased an identical one. I‚Äôve had it for about 6 months and it works great with no issues. No damage, scratches or other wear. The phone is fast and battery is normal. When it comes to used items like this, it‚Äôs a gamble. Thankfully there is a return policy when you get a bad apple."
"iPhone 12","Honestly, for $200 off this is a steal. Battery came at 90% health, no scratches that I can find, clean screen, great face recognition. The only way I could tell that it was used was the charging port had a really small amount of dust. Otherwise would‚Äôve never known it was used."
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôve had this refurbished phone for a couple of months now. It arrived in great condition- the only noticeable flaw was a small scratch on the screen. Works like new and was easy to set up with Verizon."
"iPhone 12","as advertised ‚Ä¶.perfect transaction"
"iPhone 12","Very good product....battery is 97%"
"iPhone 12","I am happy with this purchase. The phone came in a simple box but was packed really well. It was unlocked and all I needed to do was a simple cloud transfer and a sim card swap. Super easy. No visible damage on the device and everything seems to be working well. Happy with this purchase!"
"iPhone 12","Amazing quality definitely recommend!"
"iPhone 12","Todo de maravilla para ser refurbish est√°n como nuevos"
"iPhone 12","No supero mis expectativas como lo hab√≠a hecho en otras ocasiones."
"iPhone 12","My reconditioned iPhone 12 works great and is in new condition. Was shipped USPS so it took a little while to get here but it was worth the wait."
"iPhone 12","I understand that the device is used I was prepared to have scratches and cosmetic defects but not software functionality issues the face recognition sometimes fail even after using it to unlock phone a few seconds ago the evidence gets frozen (I do have storage I use to work on phones) secondly the battery percentage was way too close to servicing next thing is the device also delays on boot up or turning screen on or offered"
"iPhone 12","Excelente servicio y producto"
"iPhone 12","Nice iPhone, like new! Everything seems to work fine. I like it."
"iPhone 12","I was a little afraid their would be a lot of scratches since this is my first time getting a renewed device and I was honestly surprised. Also if you get the T-Mobile version it will work with T-Mobile owned places like metropcs. Mine came literally with no scratches, it was also well packaged. The battery does last a while and charges fast too. I recommend getting a separate charging block but the charger that does come with is good. I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase and not disappointed :)"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","This iPhone was. Shipped promptly, it arrived safely. It‚Äôs operating at full capacity!! Looks like new!!"
"iPhone 12","Have to make calls on either speaker or with AirPods in :("
"iPhone 12","Me agrad√≥ la rapidez, el que haya tra√≠do su protector de pantalla y la cabeza del cargador, pero esperaba la bater√≠a al menos de un 90% en adelante pero despu√©s de eso el celular est√° nuevo nuevo"
"iPhone 12","I ordered this phone as fully unlocked. When I received it I quickly realized that the sim was locked by Verizon. Luckily I was able to find a website that unlocked it online for around $40 instead of having to send it back. Not to happy I had to spend an additional $40. Other than that good phone üëç"
"iPhone 12","As promised, there were no visible scratches on the phone, it looks brand new and it was packaged with care"
"iPhone 12","Exactly as described. Excellent pre-owned condition. Best iPhone I‚Äôve ever owned."
"iPhone 12","I was looking for a uphone/renewed but was concerned about the battery life or scratches/damage. This phone came immaculate, with 100% battery life. I am very satisfied with this purchase I just transferred all my data so this is the first day very pleased with purchase so far"
"iPhone 12","Battery health was at 85%üòí"
"iPhone 12","Battery life was at 100%. Looks basically brand new with no noticeable cracks or scratches. Good experience overall."
"iPhone 12","NO BOOKLETS OR INSTRUCTIONS of ANY kind. Did come in good condition though. Only had it a few days, so to be honest, time will tell. Wish it came with some instructions or booklets. WE WILL SEE and I will update."
"iPhone 12","Phone came in pristine condition. Battery health at 94%. Would definitely recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12","Great phone but I removed the screen protector because the touch screen was slow and I discovered some scratches on the screen."
"iPhone 12","Nice phone, but I could not get the thing to pair with my hearing aids without the need to purchase a $300. dollar accessory. Most android phones have this issue.I had to return it."
"iPhone 12","Battery health 100%, could not find any scratches at all, excellent condition even comes with limited one year apple care warranty. Package comes with lighting connector and USB charger. For the price and savings you can not beat it."
"iPhone 12","Amazing quality as it should but the fact that the camera lense bezel spins is what made me give it 4 stars should I return it or naw"
"iPhone 12","Buen estado, bun funcionamiento y bateria al 90 %, recomendado 100%"
"iPhone 12","Got this and it was new no marks.Battery life was a 100%. I definitely 100% recommend."
"iPhone 12","Purchased this phone, everything works except couple things, the microphone for talking on the phone was very quiet and the battery maximum life was only at 82%, had to go to the apple store and get both those things fixed for an extra expense."
"iPhone 12","Came with 100% battery life but price went down $50 since my purchase üòü"
"iPhone 12","It met my expectations."
"iPhone 12","Excellent"
"iPhone 12","Came faster then expected and in perfect condition!I was leery getting a second had phone this way, but very happy with what I got and it has absolutely no problems what do ever."
"iPhone 12","X"
"iPhone 12","So fair, phone works fine. But I'm a bit disappointed by the condition of the phone. The sides are scratched and worn."
"iPhone 12","The frame had dirty spots on it and the charger and speaker ports were dirty"
"iPhone 12","I like the phone. But I spent a considerable extra amount to get the platinum or whatever it was so that I could get a phone with 90% battery capacity. Upon arrival it had 87% battery capacity. I know it seems like a small thing but when you buy a product with a guarantee and then upgrade it and spend more, you really should expect what you‚Äôre buying is right."
"iPhone 12","Came in two days sooner than expected, came with 80% charge and works amazingly! been looking to upgrade my phone to a new one at a reasonable price. didnt want to spend $1000 on a brand new phone! Found this one and decided to buy it based on reviews. so happy i did!"
"iPhone 12","For a iPhone that is like $600 buy it"
"iPhone 12","Wasn't as I expected."
"iPhone 12","Got the phone for my mom when hers iPhone x broke. This iPhone functions but she was pretty bummed out about the corners having some deep scratches and dings. For the price inwas hoping for less signs of wear."
"iPhone 12","Excellent conditions as described. No problems with the phone"
"iPhone 12","I honestly have never ordered a phone on Amazon before because I was always a little skeptical but these guys delivered the phone came with 90% battery life and it‚Äôs like new with just a few minor scratches on the outside aluminum 10/10 would buy again."
"iPhone 12","I own an iPhone 12. I bought one for my Dad and paid extra for the premium refurbished. I expected it to be like new (as described). The buttons don‚Äôt give any click feedback like mine do, but do function. The biggest problem is the speaker appears to be broken. Although the external speaker works, it is much quieter than my iPhone, noticeably so. I‚Äôm surprised that the quality check didn‚Äôt pick this up. It was easy to return, but a let down nonetheless."
"iPhone 12","Battery life is good, there‚Äôs not visible scratches and phone works great"
"iPhone 12","I love it I works fine didn‚Äôt come with any cracks at all amazing condition ü•≥ü•≥"
"iPhone 12","Awesome device, all metrics of the phone works perfectly. It‚Äôs practically a brand new phone"
"iPhone 12","Just got it. Seems okay"

"iPhone 12","The purchasing process was very smooth, was shipped quickly and safely, and communication has been excellent. The phone did have a noticeable scratch on the glass of the screen however with the screen protector on it is barely noticeable. Other than that everything is as advertised in like new condition."
"iPhone 12","I bought this and it came in perfect condition, no scratches at all. The battery is 85%"
"iPhone 12","Description says the phone is refurbished, and honestly I just was looking for an iPhone to use alongside my Android phone. I actually love this phone, and it was cheaper to buy it here than Apple itself. Phone is fully functional and has 0 cracks or scratches. Well worth the money!"
"iPhone 12","Feels cheap compared to 10 or 11. Screen is more clear and seems faster."
"iPhone 12","I'm still learning the different aspects of my phone, but so far it is great."
"iPhone 12","I really don‚Äôt like leaving bad reviews but I‚Äôve spent too much money on this phone not to. Firstly, all of the issues I have with this product could have been easily avoided if the seller was a little more careful. It appears as though the screen was changed. Which is fine. BUT the camera lens was apparently smudged before the screen was reapplied resulting in terrible front cam photos. This could have been eailsy avoided if he cleaned the lens before. Which unfortunately it‚Äôs too late to do. That‚Äôs 1. Secondly, the LCD has spots in 2 separate places, it appears as though the screen was damaged when applying it and they just sold it like that. I‚Äôm really disappointed in this product. I thought I was purchasing an ‚Äòalmost new‚Äô phone but instead it‚Äôs an iPhone from WISH."
"iPhone 12","2 scratches on front screen. to replace a screen is 200-250. also the battery is at almost 80 percent battery life so it drains pretty fast! says it was in excellent condtion and it was not ! not worth what i paid for it!"
"iPhone 12","Apple sells a brand new, yes brand new iphone 12 at the time of this purchase for $699. This will be new with a full 1 year warranty, plus option to extend to a second year. This item sells for $539, used, scratched up, don't know what it's been through, and comes with a 3 month warranty from Amazon ""renewed"". I think Amazon is genuinely trying to do good here, but these third party vendors are not living up to their end. I received a supposedly ""like new"" iphone 12, and it came with more than 11 cuts on the screen, 3 deep, 4 medium, and 4 other significant cuts easily visible. I just don't know what these vendors are doing, wasting time, resources sending these phones back and forth. Amazon needs to better enforce the standard for phone condition better. The back and forth is not good for the environment, or time, all of which in short supply. I Cannot recommend this seller, at all."
"iPhone 12","I just ordered this. Now I wont know what exactly will be in the box or what percentage the battery is at. I will update soon with what I get with it.Update:With renewed phones from here, if you don't like it you can get a different one. If it ends up having a tiny scratch, you can get a new one. Obviously not really new but renewed. You have 90 days to swap or get a refund. Sure it doesn't come with the iPhone box or original accessories but its not like you keep the box. In fact these come with charging block, BUT this is lightning to usb not usb-c. Still a great option. If you were like me and wondering if you should get a 12 mini to save money but are worried about how small it is Id still get the 12. I came from a 7 plus so it still feels small. Again 100% recommend."
"iPhone 12","This phone looks brand new! The phone is better than described! It is fully unlocked, works amazing ! I am very impressed with the seller. It was sent pretty fast , recommend this phone! You can't beat the quality for the price!"
"iPhone 12","The Iphone 12 looks and performs like a new one"
"iPhone 12","iPhone in perfect conditions"
"iPhone 12","it running late but that fine"
"iPhone 12","Excelente producto"
"iPhone 12","Battery heath is at 88% and seems to go down pretty fast. Faster than what 88% health should be draining.Check if the phone is actually unlocked or not. Because the phone I got was locked. Even though the description says UNLOCKED‚Äù. It was worse due to me leaving the country and only finding it out then, and also I had bought screen protector and a case, which are now useless."
"iPhone 12","Just like new! I'm happy, easy to upload my old information no issues."
"iPhone 12","This phone was in excellent condition. No scratches or visible use. The battery life was 100%! It feels like getting a brand new phone for A LOT cheaper! I will use this seller again when buying another refurbished phone."
"iPhone 12","No information about scratches or scuff marks, when it showed up it, had a scratch ON THE SCREEN. Other than the scratch, great business."
"iPhone 12","For $500, include a charger with the same specs as what originally comes with the phone. The subpar $0.10 1A USB-A charger from 2015 it came with would take 12+ hours to charge an iPhone 12 that's turned off, NEVER if turned on. It went straight in the trash."
"iPhone 12","Muy buen producto. Solo faltaron los aud√≠fonos"
"iPhone 12","I had an issue at first customer service above and beyond in less than 5 day the whole thing changes very happy awesome phone thank you for the great service. The battery sucks i give this 5 of 10 the phone glitches"

"iPhone 12","Iphone12 died 95 days after purchase of $630.18. Was kept in otter box in my purse. Was never dropped, gotten wet, left in car or outside. Just died overnight in my purse in my dining room on 0ctober 27/28th. Warranty/ return was October 21, 2022. Im a disabled senior and the only way I could afford is with Amazons 12 month same as cash payment plan. Took to 2 repair places and phone no good.
Amazon contacted suupplytronic they replied twice with exact same message: past warranty date and take fr repair! Which I previously told them I had taken to repair! So,help what so ever from them!
I‚Äôve purchased 4 refurnished phones and a IPad for Amazon and they are all working find to this day! Will try Amazon again and will never purchase anything from supplytronics againüòíüò£üò†"
"iPhone 12","Unfortunately I had to return the device in which I did get a prompt refund. My phone carrier stated that they were unable to active device due to location? When I inquired further on what that meant they said the device shows as inventory in another store location. The phone it self was in good condition but can't really provide an honest review for the device received"
"iPhone 12","Used for two months then it conked out. Black screen won‚Äôt charge or then on. Was great until then."

"iPhone 12","i had no idea how bad my old iphone 8Plus's battery had become until i got this one... this thing lasts a whole day longer than my other one without the need for charging"
"iPhone 12","Bought this for my partner and was thrilled to be able to get the purple she preferred for under $800. Delivered on the first of the delivery window in like new condition. The only problem she had connecting the phone to her service was actually an error on T-Mobile‚Äôs end when they cancelled her old SIM instead of transferring. Supervisor said it was new hireü§∑üèª."
"iPhone 12","This phone came wiped to factory setting but had a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) installed from the IT department of Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although they are software to by-pass MDM the phone was worthless to me. I took the phone to my local Apple Store and the tech stated that the MDM can only be removed by DHS. I was unable to upgrade my Iphone 8 to this Iphone 12. Once I restart the phone the MDM would come up asking for a DHS login and password. Worthless."

"iPhone 12","A few scratches here and there, but looking great and battery is excellent."
"iPhone 12","My iPhone had no apparent cosmetic scratches, or imperfections. In the package was a third party charger and plug. Battery life was 100%. Next day shipping. Great buy."
"iPhone 12","What can I say? It's an iPhone. Love the new face recognition with mask on feature and improved camera. Upgraded from an XR. So far, so good."
"iPhone 12","Price went down $14 right after I bought it. I don‚Äôt like the screen size."

"iPhone 12","Al ser renewed premium me hubiese gustado que a lo mejor si traiga el 100% de bater√≠a. Del resto excelente compra."
"iPhone 12","I was skeptical at first but I bit the bullet and bought it. Everything was great and There was not scratches or anything on it. Would definitely recommend üëçüèæ"
"iPhone 12","La bater√≠a al 93% me dura desde las 7 a.m. hasta las 12 de la noche.Nuevo (uno que otro rayoncito m√≠nimo)Lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 12","Personal use THis was ordered for me and I would have preferred a new phone"
"iPhone 12","This is a review of an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12. I‚Äôve had good luck w/ Amazon renewed products before, up until now. I purchased an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12 256GB model from Avant Solutions. I paid almost $700 for it, so I was fully expecting it to be in good condition. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an item that just does not meet Amazon Renewed product criteria of ‚Äúno visible imperfections at arms length.‚Äù. First off, the aluminum trim around the edge had a very visible scrape, which turned out to be more than cosmetic; it was dented in, and caused a bulge that I could feel when I ran my finger over the area. That packaging was fine, so it was clearly not shipping related damage - so obviously there was not very good quality control on the part of the vendor. I did not even bother setting up the phone b/c I want to return it, but because it was not purchased directly from Amazon, the return process seems to be a bit more time consuming and difficult. After this experience, I would be more inclined to purchase renewed products sold and shipped directly from Amazon, rather than from a 3rd party vendor."
"iPhone 12","Satisfied customerüëçüëç"
"iPhone 12","So after much debate I decided to get my RENEWED IPhone 12. I could not be more pleased! It‚Äôs only been 12 hours but so easy to switch from my 2021 SE. There‚Äôs not one sign of any defects cosmetically or operating.Very happy!!"
"iPhone 12","It's been a few weeks since I started using it. The side button of the product does not work. Im realy sorry"
"iPhone 12","Phone did not come unlocked. Had to pay $100 to get unlocked and it‚Äôs still not fully unlocked to any carrier"
"iPhone 12","It was quite damaged on the outside, and it doesn‚Äôt have a good battery life and really slow when charging. It was dent on the corners."
"iPhone 12","first time i get an iphone. face recognition works fine, love i can use face recognition to save passwords. battery runs out too fast, phone gets very hot after 15 min of charging i dont know why. phone charge wont pass 97% for some reason. phone i received was reconditioned but was pretty banged up on the sides and glass protector that came glued on the phone started to slowly peel off from the sides two days after i received it. phone works great so i give this 3 stars."
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase, the phone is in perfect conditions and works very well. I have not any problem with this product."
"iPhone 12","The phone was packaged very well. The phone looks brand new and works great."
"iPhone 12","The mobile did not come well checked. The screen was not real and did not last a day. On the same day of turning on the mobile, the screen has paid itself all the time until the mobile stopped working. The truth is that I bought the cell phone because I needed it to be able to work with it that week and I couldn't do it. Now I'm in the process of refunding, to see how it goes. For the next time, I hope that the telephone numbers are checked very well before sending them, please, so that this does not happen again."
"iPhone 12","I got the phone and everything seemed fine. That was until I took it outside and the Data didn‚Äôt work.Ended up returning better off going to apple"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 As you can see by the video, I received a phone that had a very inconsistent response. I thought it was just a bug first setting up the phone, then once I got it all set up it still had some inconsistencies with the responsiveness of the screen. I don't know if this was just a one off thing but it's annoying that it happened to begin with. You expect (especially when buying a refurbished product) for it to be fully tested and make sure issues like this don't occur. Now I have to return the product, wait for the refund to process and buy another phone; which is truly a giant inconvenience when this could've been prevented with a slightly more thorough testing. It might've just been a one off thing, but it's still shouldn't be happening; may I also note that the phone was barely protected during shipping (inside a box that was too big, with a bag and a plastic screen cover on it) which could've also been prevented and may have been another factor that would've messed up the phone during shipping."

No complaints. Was as advertised"
"iPhone 12","The phone look good. Just like what is described in the description. Hardly found any scratches."
"iPhone 12","Phone works great but I‚Äôm sure it does a lot more than I‚Äôm using it for. Lol. No problems so far at all."

"iPhone 12","iPhone reliability and iOS updates for years to come"
"iPhone 12","Quick delivery, like new condition and information is easily transferred via IOS.
Battery shows 88%."
"iPhone 12","Business"
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone for someone outside USA. Unfortunately calls work only on loud speaker which we dint realize during initial set up. This is a major issue and it literally makes the phone unusable. I tried to contact the business for return or replacement but they have a no return/ replacement policy when taken outside USA. The worst part of it all is when I checked Apple for IPhone 12, it is available almost for the same price. Not sure why I went through all the trouble for getting this phone!"
"iPhone 12","Phone came in looking great, but the batteries were not 80%, from a full charge i spoke on the phone for approx 45 mins, and battery was half drained.. now gonna cost me at least $50 per phone plus install fee.., for two new batteries..not happy"
"iPhone 12","I just opened my package today & it looked like this. I already used the charger for my other phone."
"iPhone 12","I love my new phone! So worth the money. Battery life at 98%. I give it 5 stars!"
"iPhone 12","the cost of the phone is very high, it looks good, they put a protector on it so that you don't notice how scratched the screen is... it's remarkable"
"iPhone 12","It came in decent conditions but the scratch on the screen upset my girlfriend a lot"
"iPhone 12","I was a bit skeptical about getting a used iPhone, but honestly I couldn‚Äôt be more happy, it came when it was supposed to it was completely unlocked came with a cable and mine had a screen protector already on it which is nice, there were no marks or anything it really is a good phone, I‚Äôd try it if I were you!"
"iPhone 12","The fact that they overly advertise the product. Yes it was clean without scratches but the battery? Yeah that was done for. From the moment I got the phone it was dead and never charged I had to go get it fixed myself instead of waiting for a refund"
"iPhone 12","Love when a renewed product arrives as advertised, earlier than expected, 100% maximum capacity battery and a screen protector pre-installed on the device.

The speedy shipping was a very pleasant surprise, as was the inclusion of the screen protector.

Device arrived in pristine condition too. Fantastic experience thus far, would buy from again."
"iPhone 12","Battery 87%, the screen was of poor quality and it has cosmetic damage. I returned the cellphone"
"iPhone 12","Very fast shipping. Great so far"
"iPhone 12","I have used different sim (T-Mobile, lycamobile and AT&T) but iPhone unable to select the network. Even I trued manual selection , I didn‚Äôt work. Rebooted multiple time , no use. I have requested for refund
Let‚Äôs see the response.
I did more research on the ICCID number, it says Unknow, it means it is defective or phone is locked.
As per the product description, it is unlocked phone. Seller is not paying for the return shipment which is one more disappointment"
"iPhone 12","Honestly I buy a phone for it‚Äôs ability provide certain things one of which is the ability to talk to people and for them to clearly hear me with this phone in particular I needed it prior to a trip to assure I have a way to contact my family as I safely travel cross country HOWEVER this phones audio quality on BOTH ends his horrible I can only assume this is due to the fact it is in fact a refurbished phone however when one pays such a steep price for a phone you hope to get at the very least the basics. I will not be recommending this phone or seller to anyone until my issue is resolved as this is unacceptable.

Edit: I removed the screen protector applied to the phone when i purchased it and under it found HUGE scratches to the glass!!! Is this a joke? I was told this was renewed not disguised."
"iPhone 12","Just loved overall very happy"
"iPhone 12","Battery life was terrible upon receipt. They sell these phones for a high price based on an almost-new sales pitch. But straight out of the box, the battery only lasted a few hours. I call BS.
Never again."
"iPhone 12","Me lleg√≥ hoy, esta muy bien cuidado, todo 10/10"
"iPhone 12","Very satified with my purchase"
"iPhone 12","Everything I need/want in a phone. camera is exceptional, change over from earlier phone was easy. hope to have this phone for several years."
"iPhone 12","Although this device does not come in the original it was in tip top shape. After thorough inspection, there were no scratches what so ever. Not even microscratches. Very satisfied with the quality of the refurbish."
"iPhone 12","The phone came looking brand new! No scratches, dents or breaks and the battery health was at 100%. It is a bit pricey for a refurbished version but it also got to my house in less than 2 days. Apple said it would take 2 weeks."
"iPhone 12","For a product sold as 'Excellent condition - renewed', this arrived with very visible scratches and dents on the body and a malfunctioning screen already giving errors. Seems like it was not handled well by technicians, has low quality aftermarket parts and is being passed off as excellent - I'd say good at best. Wouldn't recommend."
"iPhone 12","Al recibirlo, el telefono no sube el brillo. Se reinicia solo y luego no se puede bajar el brillo. Panralla apenas se puede ver. Ya se reviso toda la configuracion y no es ese el problema."
"iPhone 12","Paid $460 dollars for a phone that was fraudulent! It was a off brand phone in iPhone case. It was CRACKED and it screen didn't work and all u could hear was a woman speaking some language I couldn't even identify. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!"
"iPhone 12","Workinh just fine"
"iPhone 12","Very good quality! Just like new!"
"iPhone 12","This a good phone , it‚Äôs basically brand new"
"iPhone 12","Fully unlocked. Worked immediately with my sim. No scratches. Like new."
"iPhone 12","iPhone constantly says no service. It has done this since phone was received and connected. I thought it was the service provider so I switched services and it is still doing it. I have tried everything that google says to fix it and nothing has worked. Not sure if I was sent a defective phone or what. Unsatisfied with product."
"iPhone 12","Mi ni√±a le encanto"
"iPhone 12","Compre el celular para abot√°rgame algo de dinero, pero tuve que cambiarle la pieza que lee el chip, como lo ped√≠ para otro pa√≠s ya no pude devolverlo, a la final gaste lo mismo que habr√≠a gastado por un celular nuevo."
"iPhone 12","Love the phone"
"iPhone 12","I bought one for myself in June and one in December for my girlfriends daughter. No issues. I don‚Äôt know where these horror stories are coming from."
"iPhone 12","No son celulares refurbished, son celulares usados como dijeron en otro comentario. Compr√© el m√≠o en ‚Äúexcelentes condiciones‚Äù pero tiene ara√±azos y golpes en varios puntos del celular. Lo peor es que vino sucio en el auricular, speakers y con manchas de grasa en la pantalla. Es q decir que ni siquiera se molestaron en limpiarlo, por eso se nota q no es refurbished. No vale su precio. Inviertan un poco m√°s y mejor c√≥mprense uno nuevo con bater√≠a al 100%. Es lo q deb√≠ haber hecho."
"iPhone 12","No tiene ni rasgu√±os y funciona perfectamente. Recomiendo la compra"
"iPhone 12","Phone looked great and worked perfectly but it was still a bad phone because it came blacklisted meaning whoever previously owned the phone reported it lost or stolen so I couldn‚Äôt get it turned on with my carrier"
"iPhone 12","The speaker is low and muffled, and needs to be replaced. It should have been caught and fixed by the original seller, but they missed it. Now I have to spend more money to get it fixed."
"iPhone 12","Very happy with the product."
"iPhone 12","Not premium condition! Battery was only at 85% health. Premium price guaranteed minimum of 90% Battery health! Be careful when ordering premium and paying extra. There is no special support or service."
"iPhone 12","LOVED EVERYTHING"
"iPhone 12","Worth buying phone looks brand new very much renewed I‚Äôm very satisfied with my purchase"
"iPhone 12","Product work perfect."
"iPhone 12","Really like the new design with the iPhone 12."
"iPhone 12","I contacted the company a day after the phone arrived with my issues and their only response was ""does it have a screen protector on it?"" I would not recommend purchasing refurbished from this company. Regardless of the condition ordered."
"iPhone 12","Title"
"iPhone 12","When the phone showed up I unboxed it and when I turned it on it had a green screen and started flickering. I was able to return it minus 18.48 of the full price for some reason. Probably won‚Äôt be doing business with them again."
"iPhone 12","This iphone cannot stay connected to my carrier (sprint, now tmobile) for more than 10 minutes. I've had it for 2 days and for maybe 2 hours TOTAL, I have had cellular signal. It randomly connects and disconnects. I was using it as a GPS today and it went blank on me. This is my hometown where i always have had signal with iphones and my carriers. I spoke with apple support and they confirmed that I was sold a faulty device and that this ""pre owned"" process amazon has is a JOKE. They do not inspect these devices fully. and You have a HUGE chance of getting a faulty device. My device looks fine from the outside. No scratches or smudges. But unless you have wifi, this device is nothing for you. Im stuck with a glorified ipod touch at this point. I cannot make calls or use this phone outside my house, period. This was my first and last order with amazon renewed services. Do yourself a favor and get a new one or get one from anywhere but amazon's preowned services. amazon preowned department is a bunch of monkeys pretending to know what a working phone is"
"iPhone 12","Not bad"
"iPhone 12","Touch screen top section non responsive in less than 1 month light use. No replacement option and even Amazon could not contact the seller. Returning to Amazon for a refund."
"iPhone 12","The whole iPhone except the screen was full of scratches and also the button to turn off and on does not work well, which is what I meant I listed you did not list it on a site that has all these issues, and because of these issues I return it"
"iPhone 12","Very good product as described and expected. Very robust and easy to use and configure."
"iPhone 12","The phone was frozen at the point when setting up where you chose your country. It froze to the point where you could not turn the phone off. You could not go forward. The device is USELESS. Buyer Beware!"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","This ""renewed"" iPhone was far from being in an excellent condition as described. The battery is more than halfway worn out with less than 90% of its capacity remaining. The battery has to be replaced at 80% capacity, and once you cross 90%, the deterioration accelerates, so this phone will need to be cracked open for an expensive repair in a few months. The phone was also dirty and scratched. Finally, the box it came in was crushed and in poor condition. I'm very disappointed in Amazon's Synergy ""renewed"" phones and would have to recommend that you stay away from them."
"iPhone 12","La pantalla estaba maltratada y la vida de la bater√≠a no vale la pena"
"iPhone 12","I dislike that the phone cut on and off like 3 times and then took like 20 to 30 mins to cut back on and the fourth time is when it completely cut off and didn‚Äôt work anymore like I want a refund"
"iPhone 12","Not yet evaluated"
"iPhone 12","This was the best gift to myself item is in great condition no regrets. Great seller I would recommend them to anyone"
"iPhone 12","I have purchased 3 iPhones in the past three months for family members and two out of the 3 were damaged. This iPhone 12 had the button glued shut. They physically did not press or click or worked at all. I also ordered and iPhone 11 Pro Max which had the wifi not work (Literally greyed out and disabled) and yes I did every single recovery, reset and including DFU Reset. Idk who are the Block heads that's ""Inspecting"" and ""Testing"" these phones but they are so obviously broken I highly doubt anyone is doing any type of testing. Furthermore, the returns are outrageous. 30+ day for ""Return Processing"" Plus another 7-14 days for the money to be returned to your account. 40+ days waiting for a refund on a phone that came damaged and was shipped out literally the same day."
"iPhone 12","The phone will not get texts from Android phone called Apple they could not solve problems called our network and they could not solve problem. And tried different things it said to try on you tube and internet."
"iPhone 12","en la pantalla indica que el respuestao no es orginital, la camara terrible, LAMENTABLEMENTE yo vivo en Guatemala y me sale muy caro mandarlo a devolver, pero fue muy mala compra"
"iPhone 12","Arrived just as described. Second iPhone ordered from Amazon."
"iPhone 12","It was great"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Phone is in physically great condition but it won't charge and battery health is 88%"
"iPhone 12"," Phone is in physically great condition but it won't charge and battery health is 88%"
"iPhone 12","This is not going to work for me. I need to return it and order another one soon before I leave for my vacation."
"iPhone 12","Hasta el momento el tel√©fono llena mis expectativas, el
Producto vino bien embalado, bien protegido y y al momento que lo estaba como lo hab√≠a pedido"
"iPhone 12","It's ""like a new iPhone"" but just a bit less reliable. If I plug the charger in it freezes the screen so then I have to turn the screen ON/OFF a few times to get the touch screen working again. It's not a massive issue but it's an inconvenience. You get what you pay for :)"
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","The iPhone was perfect! In fact, three months later, I‚Äôm writing this review on it!!"
"iPhone 12","The iPhone is great it's almost like brand new and I would totally recommend it!"
"iPhone 12","This is an apple 12 Mini , I was surprised"
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone on the quicks to replace my old Iphone 7+ that broke, it says in the description that this phone comes fully unlocked and everything, my sim card isn‚Äôt working at all, i can‚Äôt get no types of service, it literally says i have no service even when my service is completely active, i had to order a replacement sim because i thought my old sim wasn‚Äôt working, turns out it‚Äôs just this phone ü•≤ , this is so frustrating cuz i love this phone and everything but i just want to be able to make calls and use my phone without wifi, i could‚Äôve just went and bought this for the full price off apple and been using my service. this is so upsetting"
"iPhone 12","this phone was absolute garbage. i would give ZERO stars. the screen was replaced and every time you tapped it make dots on the screen. there was a permanent dot in the display, it would not read my sim card, considering the screen had been replaced you would expect no scratches. there were SCRATCHES EVERYWHERE. horrible buy. a waste of $500. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS POS!!!"
"iPhone 12","The product shipped quickly and was in very good condition."
"iPhone 12","Product is in excellent condition, battery was fully charge, no marks on screen or case."
"iPhone 12","I think this iPhone comes as one as new as far I haven‚Äôt noticed any imperfections or signs of used phone. Totally in good condition almost mint"
"iPhone 12","The phone I have had problems from the first day. I will not power off and cord wasn't good. I have been trying to get in apple app. I can't get in to my apps at at all. I have called my phone carrier. But phone isn't quite up to par."
"iPhone 12","The phone broke on me in 3 months got it fix and it never started working right again. What a waste of money would never buy a refurbished phone again. I contacted the seller and they weren‚Äôt able to do a thing for me and I was just ignored for a few days right before my warranty ended"
"iPhone 12","Battery health 100%, very pleased"
"iPhone 12","Me gusto porque estaba en muy buen estado como indicaron en la descripcion"
"iPhone 12","Love my iPhone . Received it promptly and it appears to be new. I got my information transferred and it so much better than my former iPhone . I would recommend this product to my family and friends."
"iPhone 12","good condition"
"iPhone 12","The item is in good condition and come early"
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone, bought a case and screen protectors and a wireless charger to go with it, and then discovered when I put my SIM card in that it was locked. Now I have to decide if I want to try again and hope I get an unlocked phone this time, or pay twice as much for a new phone. Ugh."
"iPhone 12","Flawless"
"iPhone 12","Battery life lasts me all day since I do use my phone for work at Publix . It‚Äôs easy to login to all my accounts with face recognition and it came tempered glass screen protector best thing ever"
"iPhone 12","I was looking a refurbished iPhone. So far this phone works great, there was no sign of scratch or anything. The phone came with screen protector."
"iPhone 12","No dings or scratches, even has a screen protector. Battery at 87% capacity, other than that, the phone is perfect.

update - this phone is sim locked. The description says Fully Unlocked (Renewed)."
"iPhone 12","Screen went blank after 3 months. Took it to Apple store. They said the screen was damaged and repair was not done properly leading to moister buildup. Total garbage. Don't buy from here."
"iPhone 12","PHONE WAS REPORTED STOLEN & IS UNUSABLE WASTE OF MONEY JUST GET BRAND NEW"
"iPhone 12","I was using an IPhone 6 so you can only imagine the joy I had when this started working for me all set up. Came exactly how I wanted it to"
"iPhone 12","Damage product with a lots of scratches. very bad quality. What a waste of time and money."
"iPhone 12","My phone came dirty with glue residue all over the phone, the camera quality is bad and it would not let me log into my Apple ID . Also the price is ridiculous you can buy a BRAND NEW iPhone 12 from apple themselves for only 599 this isn‚Äôt worth it."
"iPhone 12","The phone was dirty when I got it. It was almost like someone took a phone case off of it and then threw it in a box and sent it to me. All the speakers were visibly dirty. Functionally it worked great until I tried to make a call. The ear speaker did not work at all. I could use speaker phone and the speaker for music worked wonderfully. Also, the facial recognition only worked about half the time. Most the time I had to put in the pin to open it. This would have been my first apple phone in over a decade so I don't know if this would have gotten better if I rescanned my face or not because I only had the phone for a day. The return went very smoothly though and for that I give the company props."
"iPhone 12","Compr√© este iPhone en junio y ahora ya no funciona solo duro 5 meses"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôve had this phone for 3 weeks now and the battery health has already gone down to 97% which is not normal for an iPhone 12. Especially if I‚Äôve only had it for 3 weeks. I have to pay $100 to get the battery replaced now. Not worth your money."
"iPhone 12","Awesome phone! Battery life was 100% when I got it and it‚Äôs like brand new condition. It also came with an adapter which Apple does not give you!!! Also a sim injection tool, and free pop socket! Great deal for $60 less than Apple!"
"iPhone 12","I would strongly advise a friend away from buying a renewed iphone. I ordered the 12, and will be returning it. The screen sensitivity is terrible. does not respond even as well as my 3 year old iphone6. Faulty hardware or software bug i guess. Has been a big headache for me."
"iPhone 12","They sold me a phone owned by the Department of Homeland Security. The phone is bricked and the only way to use it is by entering your DHS credentials. Obviously they never even turned the phone on to check if it is functioning."
"iPhone 12","i am going to return it not working right very disappointed"
"iPhone 12","No issues what so ever with the phone the battery is in great condition housing is in great shape screen üëåüèΩPerfect so no issues what so ever with the phone"

"iPhone 12","The front camera doesn‚Äôt work 95% of the time."
"iPhone 12","When I took this in to get added to my plan, my service company stated it was reported as ""lost or stolen"" from the serial number. Couldn't use it, even though it was unlocked. Phone in and of itself was great, and in fantastic condition, but The fact that it was probably sold illegally...yeah you only get one star, if that."
"iPhone 12","It came with three scratches and heats up a bit. The battery life is ok but could die slower"
"iPhone 12","Very unsatisfied. Took as a gift to India. Unnoticed the condition when arrived. Screen had a significant Crack. Phone came with screen guard. Guess used to cover crack. I suggest never buy conditioned phones. Spent more and get new one. Not worth it. Sorry."

"iPhone 12","I bought the phone and it came with 89% battery health. Pretty decent I would say. After finishing all the process and downloading the software update, I tried to play music just to check the speaker. The speaker was tearing up. When I called someone I couldn't hear them while on the hands-on phone calling and very low voice while on speaker.
It says certified but still got a defective product. Returning it on the first day."

"iPhone 12","This phone simply does not work. It came with issues from the get go. The screen and surroundings has dents in it like it has been dropped and mis treated. When i tried to set up the phone it will go from a black screen with a scroll wheel in the center to the home screen, back to the black screen. There is no way to make this phone work. We have spent all day researching online how to do a factory reset, but the phone wont even allow you to do that! Very frustrating and very annoyed."

"iPhone 12","Warning do not buy from Cellular Resource. Was so exicited! Everything was ok except some minor blemishes. But when the phone had no sound when trying to talk to someone, I knew I bought a lemon. I hope they send me a new one or I will be going somewhere else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ These guys actually repackaged the same defective cell phone and sent back to me. I was stupid enough to give them one more chance and try next phone was 64 gig instead of 128 gig. These guys are terrible and I will be filing a complaint about them with the Better Business Burea. Unless your idiot do not buy from the Cellular Resource."
"iPhone 12","The phone arrived in inadequate packaging to protect the phone. There was nothing to cushion the phone or protect it from rough treatment in transit.

When I tried to use the phone, it worked only long enough to load all my personal information and then went black. Despite many attempts to charge it, retart it, etc., it will not turn on or operate. Very frustrating. The phone is clearly not functional."
"iPhone 12","Worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made. This iPhone is junk. The speaker doesn‚Äôt work, the touch screen isn‚Äôt calibrated right, and the screen will dim/brighten for no particular reason.

I have purchased iPhones from Amazon in the past and have had great experiences therefore had no reservations on purchasing another one from Amazon but now I wish I would have went a different route."

"iPhone 12","everything was in order, took to phone store to activate a new sim card 5.00 bucks"
"iPhone 12","99 days after receipt of the phone, the screen went out. Contacted the seller and was informed that it was past their 90 obligation and that they would not fix or replace it. Buyer beware, defective products and a company undeserving of your business."
"iPhone 12","I was nervous due to mix reviews , but my phone works and looks great. No scratches or anything. Perfect condition."
"iPhone 12","Everything is good, my battery life is on 82 percent is my problem. My iPhone 11 I have had since they came out is on 83. I wouldn‚Äôt care if it was at like 90 but 82 will only last a few hours. I don‚Äôt want to wait another week for a new phone."

"iPhone 12","Almost brand new"
"iPhone 12","I purchased an iPhone 12 from the seller. The device's Ear Speaker was not fully functional, which made it very difficult to hear the other person speaking on phone calls. It sounded like they were speaking from way out in the distance. In addition, when watching videos using speakerphone, the volume output from the Ear Speaker side was soft and a light internal rattle could be heard. Phone was returned!!!"
"iPhone 12","What a rip off, refurbished is too expensive considering I got an inferior scratched product, it was in my possession for 2 minutes when I saw the damaged screen, never even turned it on so don't know if it worked. Insult to injury I had to pay shipping costs to return! What a waste of time and money, I will buy new only."
"iPhone 12","First thing I noticed right out of the box was that it was very dirty. The speaker that goes up to your ear is very dirty and I had to clean it. There was a ring of grime around where the case went around the charging port as well. However the thing that is making me return it is the speakers sound like they‚Äôve gotten water in them at some point. They‚Äôre very dull, almost to the point where the alarm didn‚Äôt wake me up. Listening to music or tik toks without headphones really accentuated the problem.When I paid the price that was almost the same as buying a new phone, I expected better quality than this."

Took these in same day to our provider only to find out that not just one, but BOTH are sim locked. Without knowing the previous provider, we‚Äôre SOL. I started a return immediately after finding out that they can‚Äôt be used. This product is 100% a scam. If you decide to purchase these, don‚Äôt expect them to be unlocked. Just buy new so you know you‚Äôre getting exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to."

"iPhone 12","So far no issues."
"iPhone 12","I ordered the phone option specifically for AT&T because they are my current service provider & I hoped that I wouldn‚Äôt have an issues with it being unlocked. Well, after speaking with apple twice & AT&T twice and taking the phone into AT&T, they said it was broken (unable to officially state the issue but said something on the inside must be physically broken) so I would not recommend buying one of the these phones because I still had to purchase a new iPhone.

"iPhone 12","No lo duden , es perfecto y con garant√≠a."
"iPhone 12","I had the iPhone XR, upgraded to the 12, and I don‚Äôt notice any difference at all. What I did notice, though, is that the battery on the 12 is not impressive. It actually seems that it drains almost the same as my XR drained with only 92% of battery capacity remaining. The poor battery life was one of the reasons I decided to upgrade.
The display and the camera on the 12 may be better than the XR, however, it‚Äôs absolutely not noticeable, at all. I also notice absolutely zero difference with the 5G.
That being said, it is still an iPhone, so of course it‚Äôs still a decent phone, it‚Äôs just that for a new phone, I expect it to be noticeably better than the last one, which it‚Äôs just not, and the poor battery life actually makes it a worse phone, to me.
I guess it depends on which phone you‚Äôre upgrading from. I went from the 6 to the XR, to the 12. Going from the 6 to the XR was great, but, going from the XR, or any other similar model, to the 12- is not necessary, and, like I said, the battery is awful.
I should also mention that the 12 doesn‚Äôt include a power adapter or EarPods. It only comes with a charger cord that won‚Äôt fit the previous wall adapters, so if you want to use it, you have to purchase a USB C Power Adapter. That‚Äôs crappy, too.
I‚Äôm sorry I got this iPhone 12, and wish I would have at least waited for the next one to come out. Total waste of money!"
"iPhone 12","As my eyes have aged, reading on a small screen has become more difficult. My old 6 plus had a relatively large screen which made reading easy. The 12 is both shorter and narrower. I am not willing to pay for a 12 Pro Max which is bigger.

This is an Accessibility issue that affects millions of iPhone users. Apple could make the model 12 in different sizes with little effort.

Another solution would be for all news apps to support rotating the screen. Their text length then would be more reasonable with the slightly larger print that I need."
"iPhone 12","I didn't expected to receive damaged/strached screen on Refurbished items"
"iPhone 12","No issues with my phone! You'd never know that it was renewed. Very happy with my purchase and this seller. 10/10!"
"iPhone 12","This is by far the WORST iPhone I‚Äôve ever had! Terrible battery life ( I charge at least twice a day). The reception is sometimes sketchy and it drops calls constantly. The 5G only is good in areas where towers have been upgraded. Wish I could return it"
"iPhone 12","A new Iphone 12 is $20 more! That‚Äôs all!! Why buy renewed??"
"iPhone 12","Just received the phone one week after being ordered. So far looks good. Everything looks in place and it doesn‚Äôt seem like a scam lol. The battery life looks good and everything."
"iPhone 12","Liked the overall quality, sharp pictures and long battery life."
"iPhone 12","The phone is like brand new! Battery life is 86% but I don‚Äôt mind. It lasts 12 hours perfect for me. Love it and the price was great! It‚Äôs brand new so the price was perfect! I definitely recommend."
"iPhone 12","Well, it's an iPhone 12. It works properly without any issues. Transferred my iPhone details without any issues as well. I can confirm it is unlocked and can be used with any cell phone service provider. Shipped properly without any issues."
"iPhone 12","Similar to my I-phone 7 Plus, so easy to switch over. Still working on the face recognition feature. I hope the battery life is as good as my 7 Plus, it was great until just recently. It was time for a newer version!!"
"iPhone 12","The shipping was fast and the phone is like it's brand new straight from the store. Zero scratches or defects. It came unlocked so I just put in my son's Cricket chip and the phone works amazingly. Good price for a nice device!!"
"iPhone 12","Was sceptical at first but once I got it, it WAS unlocked and was in beautiful condition! My bf loves it and it‚Äôs pretty much new! Wouldn‚Äôt know the difference!"
"iPhone 12","The reconditioned unit is like new and was a snap to set-up. It transferred all data from my Iphone 6 without a problem."
"iPhone 12","Purchased this as a work phone replacement, NO scratched, battery life is great, came with cable and wall brick. Overall a great purchase"
"iPhone 12","Battery dies fast, face recognition works sometimes and the charging port only works with certain chargers definitely needs improvement or lower the value of the phone because it‚Äôs not worth no where near a grand."
"iPhone 12","Totally my fault, phone was great just had to return due to it not having enough storage."
"iPhone 12","So far so Good! Phone came looking like brand new! No trouble activating or switching info. Fingers crossed!"
"iPhone 12","Been using it for almost an year now no problem works great"
"iPhone 12","Phone was in perfect condition! It worked flawlessly on T-Mobile transferring over from my old iPhone."
"iPhone 12","Love the phone came as described with no issues"
"iPhone 12","So I was very skeptical at first about buying a refurbished phone but I was pleasantly surprised how good it was and ready to go! everything transferred over perfectly just be patient it takes some time to move all of the data especially if you have a bunch of photos to move."
"iPhone 12","I admit I was a bit skeptical about buying a renewed phone but I got my iPhone today and I couldn‚Äôt be any more happier!! Absolutely love it. No scratches or blemishes whatsoever. It‚Äôs functioning smoothly so far. Thank you Amazon!!"
"iPhone 12","Enhancement of the previous six were much smaller and functional but still looks the same with a enlarged pixel gripper like this one"
"iPhone 12","Sent an 11 when ordered a 12. After getting sims, number, and service they wanted me to send it back and be without a phone. Wouldn‚Äôt discount for the difference either. Volume buttons won‚Äôt stay at adjustment. Lock button won‚Äôt always work."
"iPhone 12","I bought the iPhone 12 from Refurb Supply Source. The phone was delivered in two days, and came in like-new condition with 100% maximum battery capacity. I have been using the phone for 2 days now, and there have been no signs of it being a used/refurbished phone. Works like new. Very pleased!"
"iPhone 12","Recibi mi tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones, para haber sido un tel√©fono reacondicionado esta en perfecto estado. recib√≠ mi tel√©fono en Venezuela . Me encanto. Lo recomiendo y espero sirva de ayuda a muchos este comentario, ni un ray√≥n, y la bater√≠a al 100%"

"iPhone 12","The phone came in perfect condition and works good as new! I‚Äôve had it for a few days now and everything works perfectly"

"iPhone 12","If the listing didn't say it was renewed, I wouldn't know. No scratches at all, battery is at 100% capacity and shockingly, I received a [third-party] charging adapter! More value for less money than a new iPhone :)"
"iPhone 12","I am shocked at the great condition that the phone is in being refurbished as well as the high battery life. This is my second phone purchased from this company over the last few years and they both have been great."
"iPhone 12","El tlf lleg√≥ sin detalle de est√©tica, lo

"iPhone 12","I ordered one more for my sister and she loves it too!

New and works super well"
"iPhone 12","The newest IPhone. It feels good in the hand. It has boxed off sides. Face recognition works. I am pleased so far."
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","Son loves this purchase"
"iPhone 12","I spend so much money on this phone and from the beginning the wifi and bluetooth never would turn on. Now the phone keeps resetting randomly meaning idk when it will just shut off on me and for how long. This was meant to be in new condition but it had scratches on it but not something I really cared about. I just wanted a normal phone."
"iPhone 12","Battery 98%, perfect for a refurbished item. Thanks"
"iPhone 12","I don't have any problem with everything is good only one thing it didn't have was that the key was missing to put the sim but everything is good."
"iPhone 12","Como nuevo Perfecto estado"
"iPhone 12","I always feel like I‚Äôm taking a chance buying ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù electronics but the prices on the new iPhones have led me to do this twice. And I‚Äôm glad I did! This phone arrived early, perfectly packaged, and included a charging cable and cube and a sim chip remover. The phone is in perfect condition with not even a tiny scratch to be seen. I‚Äôve been using it for several days now and it works great. Battery life on arrival was 98%‚Äîawesome! The only odd thing I noticed is about the Amazon listing. The price is fluctuating a lot. One day the phone was $519, still a reasonable price, but the next it was $420. So perhaps you want to keep an eye on that and time your purchase."
"iPhone 12","love itit is my fizt iphone ad i am samsung android guy but so fsr i love thiscompering to my frinds iphone 11 this is lot better"
"iPhone 12","Excellent phone recommendI will buy again üòäüòäüòä"
"iPhone 12","-Phone has no 3.5mm jack-No wall charger is included in the box-Constantly and incessantly asks for Apple ID password, over and over, at random times, locking the Apple ID account without warning, notice, or reason, requiring email verified unlocks. One of the most frustrating user experiences I've ever had.-iTunes sync consistently fails to synchronize songs added, despite them showing up in iTunes and syncing. No warnings were displayed at all. This isn't helped by the fact that it's impossible to sort songs by date added in the music program. Wow.Unacceptable failures in design that, by 2022, should have been ironed out years ago. Oh, and the notch is annoying and hurts the design.3/5 stars."
"iPhone 12","The phone it‚Äôs an horrible condition a lot of scratches and terrible battery life the worst experience ever I‚Äôm not happy with my purchase Please guys spend your money somewhere else That phone Not worth even one third of the price"
"iPhone 12","Battery capacity is 89%. I wish it had a higher capacity, but it is okay for me to use anyway. Everything else was fine."
"iPhone 12","Muy contento por las condiciones en las que me enviaron este equipo. Impecable. Buen rendimiento de bater√≠a. Genial"
"iPhone 12","Super nice like new iPhone. Comes with a pin too. A couple of dollars off can get you a cup of coffee!"
"iPhone 12","phone is cool. but I will return it. I wanted to take for myself and my wife. but found a cheaper price. but in general, take it, you will not regret it"
"iPhone 12","Countless scratches on the back and bumps around the corners.Not even cleaned, let along ""renewed"". Totally a rip off.Can't wait to return it."
"iPhone 12","Phone arrived and appeared to be in pristine condition. Took it to T-Mobile to have it set up as my old phone. I should mention this replaced the exact same phone which I owned before I lost it. Anyhow, battery life on my two year old iPhone 12 was significantly better than the battery on this phone. They advertise 80% battery life but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs, a fact something to think about if you order one of these. I turn on my low power mode immediately in the morning at 100% and still need to charge this phone before the end of the day."
"iPhone 12","I bought my wife a gift and this was it. Buying something used always comes with its pros and cons. Overall the phone was great other than a little nick at the bottoms right if the screen and low battery health. The phone operates and normal overall."
"iPhone 12","Much better than my previous iPhone"
"iPhone 12","This phone was a perfect upgrade from my XR. Face recognition is easy to use and reliable. Easy set up after transferring what I needed. This was as advertised and worth the price. I am happy with this phone and would buy again from this seller if needed."
"iPhone 12","I was debating between the mini and regular, and I‚Äôm pretty happy that I decided to go with the regular one. Works great!"
"iPhone 12","I recently got one, I can't complain, the phone is brand new-like (clean) except for some few scratches on the side buttons but since I got it with the case is not even noticeable.I like it üòÅüòÅ"
"iPhone 12","I was forced to upgrade, I‚Äôm happy I did!! This phone works great. The battery life is great, it lasts all day. I‚Äôm still discovering things I can do on this device."
"iPhone 12","Good"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôve had it for a while now and I love it. It works really well."
"iPhone 12","I purchase an iphone 12 64GB renewed premium. Phone was like brand new and I couldnt tell it was used. The battery had 93% capacity was the only indication that it was not new. The phone came packaged in a Amazon Renewed Premium box and with a generic white charger, lightening cable and sim tray removal tool. I set up with US Mobile Super LTE sim and everything is working good so far."
"iPhone 12","All in all, it's good. 5-star for it."
"iPhone 12","I had checked up this iPhone and I expected a regular version and not a mini but it‚Äôs what I got. It has accepted my old sim from ATnT which I am happy with. I‚Äôm also happy that the iPhone was placed in my mailbox. Amazon has been losing my packages by their people leaving them at wrong doors so I was very stressed that I was going to lose my phone. So for that, you get a five star from me. Thank you."
"iPhone 12","This was a gift"
"iPhone 12","It was a perfect gift for mu daughter"
"iPhone 12","The camera works excellent"
"iPhone 12","This phone is like a 100% new phone!The quality is great. No scratchesBattery is 100%Phone guarantee is until Oct 24, 2021I can use Vietnamese sim card by this phone"
"iPhone 12","Setisfied"
"iPhone 12","I am thrilled with this purchase. The phone is in pristine condition. Has great battery life and takes great photos. Also, came with glass protector. Experienced no problems in set up and has been working fine. I would most definitely purchase again when the time comes."
"iPhone 12","You all need to stop complaining about scratches ,dents and no brick or earphones..I bought my iPhone mini brand new from Apple store and I love it.They don‚Äôt come with a brick or earphones brand new threw Apple .I bought a iPhone XR threw Amazon and loved it.I also understood it was renewed and it isn‚Äôt going to be prefect like new iPhone that was never used.if you want new go to Apple and buy new.Now the phone not being unlocked is a real reason to be refunded because they didn‚Äôt get what they paid for.It would be an expensive paper weight.Now no brick or he‚Äôd phones also complaining about it not being in a org box stop complaining.As I said new iPhone from Apple only included the lighting charging cord ,information and sim tool,that‚Äôs it,no brick or headphones"
"iPhone 12","I bought this iPhone due to the fact that it was 100$ cheaper than the original sold by apple. I‚Äôve bought phones on Amazon in the past and have had no issue with them. However, when this phone came in the mail it was different. The phone turned on and functioned all right, but I soon noticed that it would restart over and over in a span of a 30 min use. This made the phone unusable. I went into the settings and found the warranty from the previous owner. Luckily, it was still under warranty. I took it to the shop and they had to basically replace the entire phone. I was really disappointed that I was sold a broken product. :("
"iPhone 12","For some reason, the phone settings had it set up so that pictures adjusted to appear as their negatives when displayed, but if sceenshots were taken of them, they appeared normal. We had to contact apple support to figure out how to adjust this setting."
"iPhone 12","Personal phone international pleaseüòä"
"iPhone 12","The phone is in like-new condition, no sign of used at all; only without original packaging or accessories, while not really any interesting accessories coming with original new one from Apple any more. Great item, very satisfied."
"iPhone 12","Phone was for my daughter. She loves it! The battery is much better than expected. She is very pleased with the camera. Great pictures. Well pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 12","The phone is good everything working perfectly"
"iPhone 12","I was a little concerned when I first started setting the phone up and it wouldn‚Äôt charge normally. It was plugged in for 4 hours and only got to 40%. I tried my old charger and it worked like a charm. The one they sent with the phone was shot. But- that‚Äôs the only down side and it‚Äôs not a big deal. The phone looks perfect, holds a charge very well, works like it came straight from Apple! I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!! Five stars!"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. The phone is in almost perfect condition. It really is ‚Äúlike new‚Äù. It is working great so far. It also came with a screen protector, which I appreciate. If you‚Äôre unsure, just go for it! I was extremely skeptical at first because this was my first time buying a phone online but I did it and I do not regret it. Totally worth it."
"iPhone 12","Phone is in great shape and is working well. Had to get a different SIM card from ATT, as the iPhone 6 had a much larger SIM card, but we‚Äôre up and running with no issues."
"iPhone 12","Cumple con lo que es la publicacion del producto"
"iPhone 12","Really great phone seems like brand new. Brand new battery. I‚Äôve been heavily using this phone for the past month no complaints."
"iPhone 12","For calls, apps, photos, everything is perfect. I film videos and the 4k 60fps is the best, crystal clear quality of video I've ever seen. Old digital cameras are dead."
"iPhone 12","buen producto gracias"
"iPhone 12","The product works very well. The battery life is not so different than from previous versions. The device heats up every now and then when charging."
"iPhone 12","Awesome beautiful (color Red) iphone 12! Battery life was 100% when I got it and it‚Äôs like brand new condition. It also came with a charger. Super fast 2 day shipping. This is my second iphone purchase from Amazon first phone was a iphone7 - and have received great phones both times."
"iPhone 12","Estaba como nuevo , me encanto , funciona a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 12","Overall its as good as new. It doesn't come with an original box but I was well aware of that. Decent charger usb A to lightning. I was really happy with the 100% battery health. No damage on the body AT ALL. There's a very tiny scratch on the top right of the screen but it's barely noticeable. I'm thinking of buying it again for my dad. Really happy with the phone"
"iPhone 12","i was very scared reading the reviews after i bought the phone. the phone came in perfect. no visible scratches , everything works, it's unlocked. do it !!"
"iPhone 12","Si bien esta bueno, pues el producto es un Iphone de alta calidad, la condicion en que lo entregaron no es la esperada. Tiene golpes en las esquinas, aunque compre la version ""condici√≥n excelente"" y la bater√≠a me vino al 85%"
"iPhone 12","Battery is 100%, the body is perfect and the screen have a small scrat on the superior part, but it's very superficial.For a renewed iPhone deserves a 5 star."
"iPhone 12","This phone came in very good condition, however the one downside was that the phone had a 86% maximum capacity. There was some very minor scratches but that most likely happened in shipping, however they were very unnoticeable. It also was a little damaged one part, but then again this is a refurbished iPhone so for what I payed it was absolutely perfect."
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Delivered earlier, well packed, in excellent condition, the seller put a fast charge and a good quality cable, very satisfied"
"iPhone 12"," Delivered earlier, well packed, in excellent condition, the seller put a fast charge and a good quality cable, very satisfied"
"iPhone 12","I purchased the product on August 25th, and today October 16th midnight my girlfriend decided to changed the screen protector because the one that came with the phone makes a lot of finger prints, so once my girlfriend removed (it was actually a gift for my girlfriend) she noticed that there were several scratches on the screen that we didn't notice when we purchased the product ( I can't share pictures of it because we work on a cruise ship and the internet sucks on the open sea so I only can barely write reviews and purchases) I'm writing this now because we just noticed and in the product review said that the screen doesn't have scratches. I hope you guys be more honest with the description of your products next time so customers don't get this surprises after a month of purchase. I hope you can read my review. Thanks"

"iPhone 12","Excelente producto, est√©tica y bater√≠a"
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono vino con 88% de bater√≠a hubiera preferido arriba del 90% pero est√° muy bien, solo tiene 2 detalles de los cuales solo 1 es realmente visible y con una funda no se ve ninguno, venia algo sucio pero nada del otro mundo, con cables de segunda mano pero de calidad decente,

El √∫nico contratiempo es que veo 2 rayones en la pantalla, fuera de eso excelente."
"iPhone 12","Hasta ahorita no heteido problema con el producto, siento que es nuevo y se ve prometedor, hasta este momento le doy 10/10 al vendedor y a las p√∫blicacion pues me lleg√≥ lo que esperaba"
"iPhone 12","Lo agarr√© como 2mil pesos menos de lo que regularmente cuesta. Lleg√≥ a tiempo, un par de raspones que se pueden cubrir con una funda sin ning√∫n problema y bater√≠a al 100%, una chulada. BuySpry excelente vendedor."
"iPhone 12","Muy buen producto, es la primera vez que compro un Producto renew y se encuentra en condiciones impecables"
"iPhone 12","Equipo sin detalles est√©ticos, solo el rendimiento de la pila es del 88%. Me hubiera gustado que en la rese√±a del producto se mencionara el detalle de la pila."
"iPhone 12","I really, really wanted and iPhone, but I certainly didn‚Äôt want to spend over $1000 on the new iPhone 13 or even an older 12. Since the Apple Canada store NEVER has refurbished iPhones in stock, I decided to look at Amazon Refurbished. The reviews weren‚Äôt great, but I figured I could return it if it turned out to be bogus.

I got the phone, and I was pretty impressed. I inspected it under bright daylight - not a single scratch, dent, or ding. Nothing. The phone was physically flawless, apart from a bit of dirt in the mute switch (easily cleaned). The battery was at 88%, which was pretty good.

The phone set up perfectly fine without issue. I tested everything - wireless radios, cameras, speakers, microphones, sensors. Checked for screen discolouration/burn. Again, everything was perfect.

I‚Äôve been using it for the past month without issue. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous when purchasing, and I‚Äôll admit to having low expectations. It seems that this particular phone was cared for by the first owner, and was cleaned up nicely by the seller. I bought mine from Alpha Wireless CA.

So yes, I have heard the horror stories from others buying Amazon Refurbished, but if you‚Äôre careful and do it right, you might get a good one like I did. TIP: Always order from listings which say Amazon handles the shipping - that gives you the regular Amazon 30-day window, PLUS whatever other warranty the Amazon Refurbished program provides."
"iPhone 12","Esta perfecto"
"iPhone 12","La bater√≠a viene al 96 lo cual por calidad precio se me hace muy bien, y viene con algunos rayones en la pantalla pero compensa que trae una mica, todo lo dem√°s funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 12","El equipo lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones con un par de golpes en las esquinas y rayones en los bordes de las c√°maras (las c√°maras est√°n en buenas condiciones y sin rayones en los cristales).
La bater√≠a con un 87% de calidad, la pantalla sin rayones y todas las funciones operan de forma normal:
Bocinas, micr√≥fono, WiFi, Bluetooth, Face Id, etc."
"iPhone 12","Condiciones f√≠sicas muy buenas, sin da√±os considerables, muy ligeros rayones propios del uso. Funcionamiento excelente y condici√≥n de bater√≠a al 90%."
"iPhone 12","La est√©tica de 10, tra√≠a un peque√±√≠simo rasgu√±o casi imperceptible al rededor de una de las c√°maras, la bater√≠a con el 90%, el cargador la verdad si se ve bastante gen√©rico y de igual manera te llega en una caja gen√©rica, lo tuve que devolver porque la bater√≠a se calentaba mucho al usar ciertas apps como al ver las historias de IG o al cargarlo (lo cargu√© con un carga r√°pida original), tambi√©n la bocina se escuchaba mal, como si estuviera ‚Äúreventada‚Äù o se la hubieran cambiado y no fuera la original, tengo otro iPhone 12 en casa y no pasa eso, por eso decid√≠ devolverlo.
La ventaja de comprar reneweds en Amazon es que tienes 1 mes para probarlos y si no est√°s agusto devolverlos, pero ojo, las pol√≠ticas dicen que en equipos Apple la devoluci√≥n puede tardar hasta 1 mes, m√°s lo que tarde el banco en poner el dinero en tu cuenta ya que tienen que revisarlos muy bien. Toma esto en cuenta si estas indeciso entre un reacondicionado o uno nuevo.
Es la primera vez que compro un reacondicionado y mi experiencia no fue del todo buena y finalmente es cuesti√≥n de suerte con estos equipos, recuerda que no todo es la est√©tica y me queda claro que si puedes comprar un equipo nuevo no lo pienses y lo hagas pero si t√∫ presupuesto es limitado pues es un volado.
Espero te sirva mi rese√±a. üòä"
"iPhone 12","El celular viene bien, con un cargador gen√©rico y funcionando sin problemas.
Solo tenia dos rayones en el marco de la esquina y bateria al 88%, pero la verdad por precio no me puedo quejar."
"iPhone 12","Me sorprendi√≥ mucho que la bater√≠a llegar√° en un 99%, el tel√©fono no presenta muchos detalles f√≠sicos pr√°cticamente un 9 de 10, en cu√°nto a su funcionamiento es muy bueno llevo una semana con el y no he tenido problema alguno, actualizar√© despu√©s para m√°s detalles..."
"iPhone 12","Todo correspondiente a la descripci√≥n
Bater√≠a (87%)
Estetica (9/10)
C√°maras, Bluetooth, Wifi, Red (10/10)"
"iPhone 12","No est√° al 100 detalles est√©ticos pero pro el precio pasa"
"iPhone 12","Excelentes condiciones, me llego con el 100% de la bater√≠a. Mi mejor compra"
"iPhone 12","Es un buen equipo en mi experiencia es la primera vez que compro algo reacondicionado y hasta el momento no me ah dado fallas espero siga igual"
"iPhone 12","Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ y eso es con amazon quendice garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as de producto renovado y al mes ya no te da la opci√≥n de devolverlo"
"iPhone 12","Sinceramente yo lo regrese, porque los detalles est√©ticos eran visibles, ten√≠an golpes de uso fuertes eran dos, pero si eran demasiado preocupantes porque pens√© que vida le habr√°n dado entonces ? Todo era original y lo dem√°s estaba bien por el precio, sino te importan esas cosas te recomiendo el producto."
"iPhone 12","Compr√© un iphone de estado ‚Äúaceptable‚Äù, pero en muy buen estado f√≠sico (la compra fue con clevercel). Bater√≠a con el 87% de vida, ninguna pieza modificada, s√≥lo unos raspones en las esquinas (se ocultan con una funda), y lo mejor 2k menos que los que dicen ‚Äúestado excelente‚Äù. Yo s√≠ recomiendo clevercel."
"iPhone 12","Llego en muy buen estado, tiene unos peque√±os detalles casi invisibles. La bater√≠a con 94% de condici√≥n. Estoy contenta por ahora y me parece una muy buena opci√≥n para ayudar al planeta y no comprar productos completamente nuevos!!
Lo usare por unos d√≠as mas para ver su funcionamiento pero hasta ahora estoy encantada!"
"iPhone 12","Lo consegu√≠ con un costo promocional de $13,100 MXN. Por ese precio es un equipo muy bueno que no le pide nada al modelo 13 e incluso 14, ya que las √∫nicas diferencias est√°n en el chip, el video y un par de cosas m√°s como los 6 meses de Apple Music. Ahorrarse entre $5,000 y $8,000 por tener casi lo mismo es una gran ventaja, con eso f√°cil te compras los Airpods Pro.

Fuera de eso, la calidad (en mi caso) fue muy alta, ya que el equipo lleg√≥ en excelente estado (como nuevo, sin rayones, solo con cargador y cable) y hasta el momento totalmente funcional.

Recomendar√≠a comprar aparte un cable USB-C a Lightning para aprovechar la carga r√°pida y una buena funda para que luzca."
"iPhone 12","No se si fue suerte pero me salio bueno a pesar de ser reacondicionado"
"iPhone 12","Tengo un mes con el celular, hasta el momento me ha funcionado muy bien, me llego bien cuidado con algunos peque√±os rayones que no se notan,la pila es de 89%, lo entregaron con cargador,cable,estoy muy satisfecha con la compra"
"iPhone 12","Hice un estudio previo a la compra asi que el iPhone llego como se supone que llegan todos los Renewed, la caja en perfectas condiciones y con lo prometido. El telefono SI tiene signos asi que le dare en estetica un 9/10 tiene 3 ""picaduras"" en los marcos y un muy peque√±o raspon en el borde de la camara. La pantalla tiene muy pocos ara√±azos, nada que impida el uso de la pantalla ademas que el protector hace que se vea impoluto. La bateria llego en 90% y el cargador incluido es funcional a mas no poder, inclusive quise hacer la primer carga con un cargador rapido de Samsung y no quizo, solucion: usar el incluido generico. El software esta bien, la compatibilidad con la telefonica (Telcel) a la primera, 4G y 5G funcional, y todas las conexiones funcionales. En pocas palabras hice una prueba general que me llevo un dia y medio y nada fallo. La bateria no tiene problemas, la pantalla no tiene problemas, las camaras funcionan perfectamente. Creo que abriendo la mente a pensar que es un celular seminuevo te das cuenta que es una excelente compra y que te ahorraste un muy buen dinero."
"iPhone 12","No viene con cargador."
"iPhone 12","Es muy buena oferta y el tel√©fono est√° perfecto tiene unos muy peque√±os detalles pero nada importante o que afecte, si lo recomiendo por el precio que es esta mucho mejor que uno nuevo"
"iPhone 12","Super√≥ todas mis expectativas, qued√© muy satisfecho con mi compra. Lleg√≥ al d√≠a siguiente. El iPhone ven√≠a bien empaquetado, con mica en la pantalla y cargador. Solo con unos peque√±os detalles en la c√°mara que realmente no se notan nada. Capacidad de la bater√≠a del 93%"
"iPhone 12","He comprado antes equipo electr√≥nico ""refurbished"", ""open-box"", y un Iphone X ""re-acondicionado"" hace 3 a√±os que finalmente ha fallado y quise reemplazar con el modelo 12, pues para m√≠ representan un gran retorno de valor por mi dinero; sin embargo creo que est√°n pervirtiendo malintencionadamente el uso de la palabra pues la unidad que recib√≠ es simple y llanamente usada. En la imagen incluido se aprecia el da√±o que presenta la carcaza, que ser√≠a lo primero que espero sea re-acondicionada, pero pero a√∫n, al encender el equipo el sistema indica que la vida de la bater√≠a est√° al 86%, misma que debi√≥ ser ""re-acondicionada""; entonces no entiendo qu√© es lo que dicen que garantizan en el re-acondicionamiento, simplemente deber√≠an decir unidad con dos a√±os de uso y listo, si alguien lo compra sabe qu√© esperar.
Las estrellas otorgadas son por la r√°pida atenci√≥n al env√≠o, aunque puedo suponer la urgencia por deshacerse de inventario muerto. En apple el totalmente nuevo est√° s√≥lo cuatro mil pesos m√°s, que es lo que har√© √©sta vez: ir a la segura con el nuevo"
"iPhone 12","Me gust√≥ mucho el iphone 12 que compr√© ya que ten√≠a 92% de bater√≠a y una est√©tica de 9.8, recomiendo al vendedor BuySPRY."
"iPhone 12","Todo bien"
"iPhone 12","Aunque es verdad que cuenta con buena est√©tica dentro de lo que cabe (porque tanto la bocina de arriba como el micr√≥fono y altavoz est√°n sucios), me lleg√≥ con 88% la vida de la bater√≠a ü•π, se comporta bien, pero con otros proveedores es raro que llegue por debajo de 90%, de ah√≠ en fuera todo excelente."
"iPhone 12","TODO BIEN, VINO EN CAJA GENERICA.. EN ESTETICA LE PONDRIA UN 9"
"iPhone 12","Con el dispositivo todo bien hasta el momento, solo que el cable para cargar venia mal... tendria que haber sido usb a lightning y me venia con un usb a usb tipo ""c""."
"iPhone 12","La descripci√≥n del producto era de condici√≥n excelente, da√±os no visibles a m√°s de 30 cm y aparte, un equipo supuestamente ""renewed"". Ven√≠a totalmente golpeado, la pantalla rayada e incluso levantada, como despegada y quisieron ""enga√±arme"" poni√©ndole una mica. Terrible experiencia, no vale para nada la pena, est√°s comprando un producto peor que usado, porque mi celular actual tiene 5 a√±os conmigo y no tiene la cantidad de golpes que este supuestamente renovado. Ya hab√≠a comprado por amazon renewed y fue impecable, pero esta vez s√∫per mala experiencia"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","En general, el equipo est√° en muy buenas condiciones. La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° al 100%, est√©ticamente no tiene ning√∫n detalle ni en la parte trasera ni en los laterales y todo funciona perfectamente.Lo √∫nico que no est√° en tan buena condici√≥n es la pantalla, que cuenta con algunos rayones visibles y que son m√°s profundos de lo que esperaba de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n del producto, pero debido a que lo dem√°s est√° en perfecto estado no me molesta.En cuanto a los accesorios, no son originales; el cable me parece bueno pero el cargador si me parece de mala calidad por lo que no lo us√©. Adem√°s, el equipo ven√≠a con un cristal templado instalado, lo cual se agradece.Definitivamente me parece una muy buena compra, con el √∫nico detalle de que la condici√≥n de la pantalla fue peor de la esperada."
"iPhone 12","Estaba un poco nerviosa de saber c√≥mo iba a llegar pero para mi sorpresa todo lleg√≥ en orden, y con bater√≠a condici√≥n al 100%, no me ha fallado en nada el iPhone, lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"iPhone 12","Lleg√≥ pronto, me lleg√≥ con la pila al 100 funciona bien, solo que lleg√≥ con unos rayones en la pantalla los cuales no afectan su funcionamiento y solo se notan con la pantalla apagada"
"iPhone 12","Equipo en muy buen estado"
"iPhone 12","Muy recomendado ,compre el renovado de Amazon Estados Unidos y fue una excelente compra , esta totalmente nuevo ."
"iPhone 12","El estado era casi perfecto, un peque√±o golpe en una esquina y un ray√≥n menor, marca condici√≥n de bater√≠a al 100%, el sistema no marca reemplazo de bater√≠a y marca justo 12 meses de uso, el problema es que la bater√≠a si bien dura, no llega al nivel de una bater√≠a al 98% de uno uso con el que pude comparar, por lo cual me hizo sospechar que fue alterado el software.Casi todo funciona bien pero algunas apps se traban o como en el caso de Tik Tok, se queda pegada una canci√≥n del video anterior.Lo devolv√≠ porque no me dio confianza esas fallas random de software.En mi caso era la versi√≥n premium ,Vendido y enviado por Amazon USA"
"iPhone 12","Compr√© el articulo pero ven√≠a bloqueado de por operador :(. Regres√© el telefono y volv√≠ a comprar pensando que solo fue mala suerte la primera vez, la segunda vez todo excelente, el iphone esta en muy buenas condiciones y ahora si esta desbloqueado."
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono lo mandan en perfectas condiciones, funcionando todo, sin embargo mi equipo lleg√≥ con un ray√≥n profundo en la pantalla (se entiende debido a que el equipo no es nuevo)"
"iPhone 12","Para ser un equipo remanufacturado, est√° en buenas condiciones. La pantalla, sin rayones y el funcionamiento de hardware y software est√° bien. s√≥lo unos detalles m√≠nimos de est√©tica en la parte inferior. lleg√≥ bien empacado.El √∫nico problema es que necesito factura y a la fecha el vendedor no la ha enviado despu√©s de varias solicitudes."
"iPhone 12","Honestamente si he comprado bastantes productos refurbished y la gran mayoria me han salido muy buenos, pero este se llevo la corona. El iphone me lleg√≥ con 98% de bater√≠a, mica de cristal templado y Apple Care con vigencia de 7 meses el d√≠a de la compra. Desconozco si todos vengan en esas condiciones pero al menos el m√≠o si lo tra√≠a. Lo mejor de todo es que por comprarlo en los d√≠as del prime day, me cost√≥ un 40% menos de su precio original!"
"iPhone 12","Excelente llego como nuevo y hasta con mica"
"iPhone 12","En el anuncio mencionaba que hab√≠an dos opciones: buena y excelente. Seleccione ‚Äúexcelente‚Äù, pero el equipo ven√≠a con rayones"
"iPhone 12","El producto lleg√≥ a tiempo y gran est√©tica , solo un peque√±o detalle en la parte de aluminio del tama√±o de la punta de una aguja. De ah√≠ en fuera como nuevo la pila al 100% ning√∫n ray√≥n visible en la pantalla. Viene con protector de muy buena calidad comet√≠ el error de ponerle uno y la calidad del touch bajo much√≠simo por eso me di cuenta que tenia doble mica termine quit√°ndole la otra. Trabaja de las c√°maras excepcionales cabe resaltar que ten√≠a el S20FE solo extra√±o poco el Zoom de 3x pero realmente se usa pocas veces. Estoy muy feliz con esta compra."
"iPhone 12","Vida de bater√≠a al 99%, est√©tica de 9.5/10, excelente relaci√≥n calidad-precio. No viene con el cargador ni cubito originales, pero es gen√©rico y funcional. Lo volver√≠a a comprar totalmente."
"iPhone 12","El equipo me lleg√≥ con el 100% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a y pens√© que la hab√≠an cambiado pero al revisar el serial es el mismo de f√°brica, solamente unos rayones en la pantalla y la tapa trasera que a simple vista no se ven de tienes que verlo a contra luz, de ah√≠ en fuera el equipo parece nuevo y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Lleg√≥ con 90 por ciento de bater√≠a, lleg√≥ sin ning√∫n rasgu√±o, en verdad que a vista parece un equipo totalmente salido de tienda, incluso vino con una Mica incluida y el cargador generico es carga r√°pida, lo recomiendo mucho, ya voy para un mes con el y todo est√° perfecto"

"iPhone 12","El equipo llego con muy pocas imperfecciones, alg√∫n que otro tall√≥n en las orillas y bordes de la c√°mara, lo que si no me gusto para nada fue que ni con la ""limpieza"" de expertos Amazon pudieron borrar las marcas de uso de la funda del antiguo due√±o.
bater√≠a 87%
golpes y rayones, aceptables ya que hablamos de un equipo usado, eso si la pantalla impecable ning√∫n desperfecto. solo que eso de que tenga marcas de uso de funda la limpieza algo flojita por partes de los trabajadores.. por un ahorro de 4500 pesos. pues esta bien, igual hay lugares como movilmx y smart depot que lo encuentras mas barato."
"iPhone 12","Muy buen celular, lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 12","El producto me indica que la pantalla no es original y que fue sustituida por una pantalla que no da garant√≠a de que el celular funcione correctamente."
"iPhone 12","El telef√≥no me llego en 1 d√≠a, me llego con la cajita generica igual que el cargador, el dispositivo fisicamente tiene solo 2 golpecitos uno en la parte de abajo y uno cerca de la camara, pero no afecta nada a la camara solo es un peque√±o rayoncito en el borde que cubre a la camara, fisicamente es un 9.5 funcionalmente jala bien la vida de la bateria es de 87% hay gente que les toca suerte y sale arriba de 90 pero bueno esperemos que no afecte en su funcionalidad"
"iPhone 12","El producto llego en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, 100% de vida util de bateria e inclusive tenia un protector de pantalla ya instalado, estuvo perfecto.

El unico detalle, viene con un cable muy corto y un adaptador de corriente de pocos watts, es necesario comprar los aditamentos si quieres conseguir una mejor experiencia pero comparado con uno nuevo y sellado que tampoco viene el cargador si es un buen ahorro, lo recomiendo si buscas no invertir tanto en un telefono de esta gama."
"iPhone 12","Es el segundo iPhone 12 que compro y el primero me llego con 89% de bater√≠a y en est√©tica un 9 y este √∫ltimo me llego con bater√≠a 100% y est√©tica al 10 pr√°cticamente podr√≠a decir que era nuevo."
"iPhone 12","Nicely packaged. Actually is in excellent condition (which is the condition I picked). No scratches on this one. Genuine product. Comes with a charger too."
"iPhone 12","Llego con 90% de vida de bateria, tiene algunos rayones y detalles est√©ticos pero no se perciben a simple vista y no afectan en el rendimiento. Viene perfectamente limpio y con una mica de cristal templado."
"iPhone 12","Se le acaba la pila s√∫per r√°pido
Aveces se trababa la pantalla al comienzo
El audio se escucha horrible si quiero poner altavoz o m√∫sica
Pero la est√©tica f√≠sica s√∫per da el gatazo"
"iPhone 12","Producto no es reconstruido como dise de echo es usado cargador no son originales caja no vino solo ven√≠a la caja de Amazon ven√≠a solo el tel√©fono , cheque la pila solo trai el 80% nada que ver con las foto que publico trai rayones en la parte de abajo y el display no es oled seg√∫n yo lo compre por que era reconstruido No usado , un poco desecionado üòî"
"iPhone 12","Me anim√© a comprarlo pues necesitaba cambiar mi anterior tel√©fono. Al leer los comentarios fue que me convenc√≠, de ve casi como nuevo, leves detalles de en la parte de la c√°mara que se despint√≥ pero es menor a 1mm, son solamente dos puntitos. As√≠ en otras dos zonas que siendo honestos apenas y se notan, con funda ni siquiera sabr√°s que no es nuevo. Todo funciona perfecto, bater√≠a al 91%, muy satisfecho con la compra. Viene en una caja genetista con cable ‚Äúhecho para iPhone‚Äù y un cubo gen√©rico, adem√°s de cubierto en una pel√≠cula para evitar rasgu√±os en el tel√©fono, no me arrepiento hasta ahora."
"iPhone 12","Tomando en cuenta que es un equipo USADO, esta muy bien bater√≠a al 90.
Hablando del iPhone 12 red tiene un lado sin metal pero es normal por la edici√≥n"
"iPhone 12","Me cost√≥ muy barato para las condiciones en las que ven√≠a, pr√°cticamente como nuevo y con el 100% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Todo funciona excelente, fue una gran compra"
"iPhone 12","It looks and operates like new, I am very pleased.
I am amazed at how easily and fast it was transferring all my data and apps from my old iPhone 7 to this iPhone 12.
Everything works like new."

"iPhone 12","El art√≠culo lleg√≥ bien, totalmente desbloqueado con est√©tica de 8/10 y con porcentaje de bater√≠a de 87%, hasta el momento a funcionado muy bien y la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a es buena"
"iPhone 12","Me lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y ya con una mica puesta, bien empaquetado en una caja gen√©rica y con un cargador gen√©rico, el √∫nico pero es que lleg√≥ con 89% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a pero me dura todo el d√≠a con uso normal, hasta ahora tengo 1 mes aprox con el celular y funciona Perfecto con telcel y ATT"
"iPhone 12","Mi producto lleg√≥ est√©ticamente bien. Me encanta el color y como se ve pero no puedo utilizar Face ID y una bater√≠a menor al qu√© dice la publicaci√≥n."
"iPhone 12","Pues tuve mala suerte, est√©tica de 8/10 viene con varios rayones y la bater√≠a es de 88, lo voy a devolver"
"iPhone 12","De la mejor compra, tuve la oportunidad para comprarlo cuando a√∫n estaba m√°s BARATO y no me arrepiento, el equipo lleg√≥ intacto, nuevo totalmente, sin ning√∫n ray√≥n, hasta la bater√≠a en 100% no lo pod√≠a creer, recomiendo el equipo y al vendedor. Mi primera compra renewed y de la mejor experiencia"
"iPhone 12","El celular funciona muy bien, son solo peque√±os detalles est√©ticos pero no afecta al funcionamiento."

"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono estaba como nuevo, bater√≠a al 100%, solo un peque√±o detalle en la pantalla pero es imperceptible.
Al activar el tel√©fono se apag√≥ la pantalla y busqu√© informaci√≥n y es una cuesti√≥n de firmware que se soluciona al reiniciar el tel√©fono. Muy buena compra lo recomiendo ampliamente."

"iPhone 12","Comprado con el vendedor BuySPRY, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones, solo un rayo en la parte de arriba del tel√©fono, pero ya prendida la pantalla no se nota. Todo correcto y original; pantalla, bater√≠a, IMEI, n√∫mero de serie, todo en orden. La bater√≠a me lleg√≥ con un 99%. Buena compra."
"iPhone 12","Lo devolv√≠, porque la bater√≠a estaba al 86%, la considero muy baja para ser un Iphone 12."
"iPhone 12","Estaba nerviosa porque en las compras de celulares reacondicionados te puede llegar de todo y tampoco hab√≠an rese√±as de M√©xico, pero mi celular lleg√≥ intacto!!! Como nuevo!! La verdad estoy muy contenta con mi nuevo celular, es hermoso y tiene todo lo que esperaba üòçüòç"
"iPhone 12","Tal vez tuve mala suerte, el celular lleg√≥ y funcionaba bien, pero luego a las horas de calentaba mucho, y la pantalla no respond√≠a del todo bien, luego a los tres d√≠as, dejo de funcionar la pantalla, por suerte pude regresarlo."
"iPhone 12","Me llego a tiempo, me llego unos rasgu√±os pero muy superficiales, de bater√≠a me llego al 89% con mica, para el precio fue una excelente compra, el √∫nico pero que le pondr√≠a es que viene con cargador y cable gen√©ricos, pero de ah√≠ en m√°s todo est√° Perfecto"
"iPhone 12","Me toc√≥ un dispositivo con el 100% de salud de la bater√≠a, con unos rayones casi imperceptibles (no not√© los rayones cuando le puse mica) y funciona demasiado bien, fui a Apple a que le corrieran un test y todo sali√≥ s√∫per! Es seminuevo y desde mi experiencia muy recomendable!

"iPhone 12","El producto est√° muy bien, me lo mandaron sin ning√∫n golpe, solo un muy muy leve rasgu√±, no visible a simple vista. Les recomiendo comprar el producto directamente con *Amazon internacional*, ya que te mandan una caja con los datos de que se reviso del equipo y la pila est√° casi nueva, y pues lo principal, es que 100% seguro que te env√≠en el tel√©fono que pediste"

Afortunadamente, este iPhone 12 de 64gb que compr√© es hermoso y funciona a la perfecci√≥n. La estetica es de 10/10 y yo corr√≠ con la suerte de que la condici√≥n de bater√≠a viniera al 100%.

"iPhone 12","EXCELENTE EQUIPO LLEGO COMO NUEVO"
"iPhone 12","Sin lugar a dudas una compra satisfactoria"
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono muy bonito por la parte de atr√°s pero el frente todo rayado como si un ni√±o hubiese usado las llaves para dibujar en la pantalla del iPhone! Luego el vendedor le pone una mica de protecci√≥n para simular que el tel√©fono est√° en buenas condiciones! Un verdadero enga√±o! No puedo creer que Amazon se preste a este tipo de estafa! Este tel√©fono no vale esos 500 d√≥lares que me cobraron!!!!!Ojal√° y Amazon ponga en su lugar a estos vendedores fraudulentos! üò°"
"iPhone 12","El equipo lleg√≥ bien, con caja y cable (gen√©ricos pero funcionales). Tiene unos leves raspones que se ven al detalle, en funcionamiento, hasta el momento, perfecto"
"iPhone 12","Got my phone. Wasn't unlocked like they said. Completely unacceptable. Don't ever buy from them."
"iPhone 12","Al recibir el tel√©fono (iphone 12)hace 4 meses parec√≠a una excelente compra. Soy muy cuidadosa, nunca se me ha caido ni mojado, esta como nuevo, sin embargo dej√≥ de funcionar de la nada. Casualmente solo un mes despu√©s del periodo de garant√≠a. 16,000 pesos a la basura, el vendedor simplemente dej√≥ de responder y se lava las manos con su garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as. Son tel√©fonos listos para durar solo 4-6 meses. Cuidado!"
"iPhone 12","Me encanto que lleg√≥ Rapid√≠simo. Con un estado de la bater√≠a del 97%..| T√©cnicamente Nuevo y a un s√∫per precio"

"iPhone 12","El equipo en buen estado solamente que no es lo que dice la descripci√≥n puesto que dec√≠a que era equipo libre pero ven√≠a con una sim de T Mobile, y estaba bloqueado por el operador al momento de ingresar mi sim de Telcel me mencionaba ese bloqueo de SIM inv√°lida, solicitar√© mi reembolso."
"iPhone 12","El d√≠a que lo use una aplicaci√≥n trabo el iphone, y tuve que forzar apagado. No volvi√≥ a pasar hasta una semana despu√©s, se calentaba, se trababa y se apagaba solo, ademas llego con una c√°mara un poco golpeada. Me desilusiono que se da√±ara el equipo a la semana."
"iPhone 12","La bater√≠a es un chiste, tengo que cargarlo 3 veces en el d√≠a, la c√°mara, saca las peores fotos. todas las aplicaciones son de pago. Por suerte solo lo necesito para mi trabajo. mi Pixel 4XL es mil veces mejor."
"iPhone 12","Compre un IPhone 12 reacondicionado con la teor√≠a que todo funciona a la perfecci√≥n pero no me deja ni configurarlo, no me deja pasar de la secci√≥n (selecciona tu pais o region ), por lo tanto lo devolver√©, les contare como me fue con la devoluci√≥n, saludos"

"iPhone 12","Pantalla rayada, lentes rayados y lo venden como ""renewed"" cuando claramente es un producto que ya ha sido usado y alterado. 30 minutos bastaron para darme cuenta de que no val√≠a la pena, encima le ponen una mica de cristal para ""esconder"" los rayones y aparentar que est√°n en la mica cuando no, est√°n en el celular. Mala experiencia por completo"
"iPhone 12","El iPhone con una est√©tica de 9.7, una bater√≠a del 98%, hasta el momento no ha fallado nada."

"iPhone 12","No sirvi√≥. El iPhone 12 que ped√≠ no funciono. Su estado era bueno, sin embargo nunca se pudo configurar, no se pudo actualizar y tampoco dej√≥ transferir los datos, lo que me hizo pensar si era ROBADO. Ya hab√≠a comprado anteriormente un iPhone 8 renovado y no tuve problema, pero este fue una total decepci√≥n.Regres√© el tel√©fono y para evitar problemas mejor ya no lo volver√© a comprar."
"iPhone 12","El celular lleg√≥ est√©ticamente bien, pero se reinicia sin ninguna raz√≥n a cada rato y parece tal cual lo regresan lo ponen a la venta sin rebizarlo realmente"
"iPhone 12","El producto me lleg√≥ r√°pido, pero al momento de prender el celular, no se ve√≠a nada, estaba activado el voice over e intent√© varios metodos para hacer que se activara la pantalla pero NO, lleg√≥ totalmente inservible. En cuanto la estetica del t√©lefono estaba en un 9 de 10"
"iPhone 12","El dispositivo ten√≠a multiples rayones en la pantalla y parte trasera, los bordes de las camaras principales se encontraban astillados.En general, el articulo estaba muy maltratado."
"iPhone 12","Pens√© que iba a salir bueno el tel√©fono, pero en cuanto actualice el sistema, ya no me permiti√≥ continuar y se da√±o la antena del celular ocasionando que ya no lo pueda usar para llamadas ni se√±al, una l√°stima."

"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was brand new! Battery health of 100% perfect condition!
The only problem was that when I logged in my Apple ID, my data was stolen and purchases were made on my card within a few minutes."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came the morning after I ordered even though It was suppose to come a week later, everything came as described without a scratch,
the phone was at 100% max battery. Best purchase I‚Äôve ever made on Amazon, definitely worth it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Item is exactly as stated in the seller description. Love the size! Didn't use facial recognition so can't rate it. Got all the features and no scratches on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","So at first I was sketched out because it came in a box that was like for a phone I‚Äôve never seen before but I opened it and was super excited. I mean it had a cube and charger and the phone was in perfect condition. It even had a screen protector on it which was cool. But I‚Äôm very excited and hope this helped!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived actually unlocked and worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in, which after a long struggle with carriers and phones was a big relief. I can't speak on the facial recognition because I don't use it, but it seems like a like-new phone to me."
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought for my daughter's 11th birthday and she loves it. Fast shipping great quality picture is beautiful and the mint color is gorgeous üñ§"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone on sale on early access day and I chose to pay a little extra for the higher standard refurbished version. When I received it everything was good except there was an area on the screen that had several scratches. It is advertised as being scratch free with 90% battery but mine was scratched. My only recourse is to return it, not exchange it, meaning I lose the sale price."
"iPhone 12 mini","I order one from this shipper. It came with a malfunctioning screen and a notification on apple that the screen was not supported.
They don‚Äôt appear to do exchanges, so I had to return the first one and buy another.
Second try got one that works."
"iPhone 12 mini","ok so like most people buying a renewed from from amazon, I was a bit skeptical. However, when I got the phone in the mail I have to say I shocked. okay it wasn't packaged the best but it came with a SIM card remover, brand new charger, and a box which apple no longer provides. everything is working perfectly but when I unboxed the phone I noticed a pretty deep scratch on the bottom of the phone. I was a bit turned off but I had to remind myself that its a used phone that was half the price of a new one. overall im happy with my purchase and the scratch is no big deal just caught me off guard"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was in Need of a new phone but couldn‚Äôt afford it brand new. I was concerned refer bisher wasn‚Äôt legit, but this phone is good as new and has been everything I needed. I have had no problems and I have had my phone for two or three months now."
"iPhone 12 mini","ty for this phone i love it. its a pretty blue i love and its a great phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I like the fact that the battery health is 100%. It just have few hair line scratches and bumps on the corners. I am not very picky so for me it's ok. It is still very useful and usable. And it really came with the latest OS update when it came to me. For the price I pay for it, it is worth it. üòÅ"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone because my trusty iPhone8 was failing on me.
This is a good phone and there's no question about that. I use most of the features and like them.
Just one observation: while the mini form factor was great in its time, and I thought I would stay with it, I have the sense that app designers are making use of more screen real estate in their designs, and that the mini design is less than adequate today. Typefaces seem to be getting progressively smaller, and links are harder to hit.
My sense is that I should have gone with the now standard form factor rather than the mini, and I assuredly will for my next phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini looks and functions perfectly, battery maximum performance is 84% but that‚Äôs to be expected for a two year old iPhone. The battery still lasts for about a day on a charge. $340 for a unlocked phone in excellent condition is a great deal, I think."
"iPhone 12 mini","No issues what so ever."
"iPhone 12 mini","Like some of the other reviewers, I had concern about the condition of a 'renewed' phone. As it turned out, it arrived in perfect, like-new condition. No observable defects, no observable wear/scratches/scuffs even when looking closely, not at arms length as Amazon mentions.

Using the iOS battery health app, the battery health was at 100% when I received it. Amazon advertises that the phone will arrive with at least 80% battery health. To check, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health and then look at Maximum Capacity. If it shows up in problematic condition, Amazon covers it with a generous 90 day return policy. I suspect that the one I received was an 'instant regret' purchase by the original owner and returned immediately. It seems likely that most 'renewed' phones will have some battery degradation so expecting battery health to be at 100% is unrealistic.

The only issue I had was not related to this phone. Call sound quality wasn't good and drop outs. After doing a network reset, that was fixed. Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset Network Settings > enter your passcode and then Reset Network Settings (red letters). Your phone will reboot. You'll have to log on to your wifi network again and if you have a VPN, you may have to set that up again. After doing this, no drop outs and good sound quality. Note that the network reset process changed after the iOS 15 update. Going forward, the sequence above may change again.

Amazon's refurb department did a great job of cleaning, wiping the previous installation of iOS and repackaging it. Regardless, I did a complete reset before restoring from a backup. This probably isn't necessary but it brought some peace of mind knowing that It was a clean installation of iOS.

It arrived in a well designed aftermarket box designed for cell phones, an Apple charger, Apple cable and an aftermarket screen protector of the type used for shipping protection. They mention that it may come with an aftermarket charger and cable so don't expect Apple branded accessories.

Presumably most people purchasing the iPhone 12 Mini will have informed themselves of the pros and cons of this model (ahem..battery life). I'd guess that most will not find battery life to be an issue. For heavy users and for those that regularly use high drain features such as GPS navigation, it would be advisable to have charging capability in the car and at work.

The only thing I'd add is that if you want the leather MagSafe case from Apple, keep an eye on prices. It usually sells for 60 dollars but the black one was on sale in Amazon at the time of this writing for 23.99 + tax. Instant purchase and on the way.

I used an Apple leather case with an iPhone 8. I was satisfied with its basic protection, feel and handling. Its unlikely to provide as much drop protection as an Incipio Duo and other cases designed with drop protection in mind but 23.99 + tax was hard to pass up.

Happy customer, solid purchase for an unlocked iPhone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Wasn't disappointed."
"iPhone 12 mini","It is so nice to have an option to have an iphone without the insane price tag! it came in perfect condition and you wouldve never guessed that it was used!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini for 400$ battery was at 100% life out of the box not a single scratch or dent this is my second time buying from Amazon renewed I would definitely recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love the small size and the color because I can see it wherever I lay it down."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am not a fan of Apple products but needed this phone to work with other systems. The battery capacity was 88% out of the box (meaning 88% of the battery was functional and at full-charge (a reading of 100% after charging) meant it's full capacity of 88% was reached). I bought this refurbished so I was not expecting a full-capacity battery load. With that said:
* I downloaded @ 8 of my favorite apps and removed/closed down a number that came with the phone that I would never use
* Leaving the phone on without any frequent use, the battery charge lasted 3-4 days (@ 72-96 hours). I have not put it to the test of typical use phone/web/streaming use yet
* The set-up was uncharacteristically simple and without a glitch - very surprising and greatly appreciated
* Facial recognition has been perfect so far
* My other phones have been large in size - but I thought I would try this ""mini."" Again, to my surprise - I really like it. I can hold and operate the keyboard with one hand - and small hand at that. It is very lightweight and easily fits into a pants pocket.

So far, so good - very pleased."
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno. Tiene una peque√±a marca en una esquina. La bater√≠a est√° al 88%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in excellent condition!! Looks brand new. Very happy I ordered."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was very skeptical about buying a phone online that was cheap like this for the phone I was getting. I read the reviews and my mind was a little more at ease. I got the phone earlier than it said which I was happy about. And the phone is in perfect condition it‚Äôs got good battery life. It‚Äôs like I bought it new from the store. I definitely recommend this product."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs perfect. I got it mainly got the size. But runs great. No issues. No scratches 100% battery.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for 8 months then the earpiece speaker stopped working. No help from the seller at all"
"iPhone 12 mini","bueno"
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value, too bad my wife dropped the phone in the toilet"
"iPhone 12 mini","I have been using this phone for just over a week now and it is just like new. Performs great, excellent battery life (may I also add 100% battery health out of the box!), responsive touch screen, great camera, fast Face ID, the list goes on. Only minor imperfection I notice is a very small scratch to the right of the screen glass (not on the screen glass) in the bottom-right corner. Otherwise, the device looks and works like it was just bought directly from Apple. If you are looking for a like-new modern iPhone on the cheap, this is one of the best money can buy.

TL;DR: exactly like new with the exception of a minor scratch, would highly recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. It was in perfect condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is in pretty good shape for being refurbished. There‚Äôs some cosmetic damage do the exterior of the case, but I use a protective case anyway, so that‚Äôs not visible.
I‚Äôm disappointed that they didn‚Äôt put a new battery in it. The battery health is only at 85%, which means I‚Äôll have to have it changed soon. I feel like a refurbished phone should come with a new one."
"iPhone 12 mini","AMAZING GET IT!!!!!! The battery capacity is 100 and works so nice"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great. Just what I was looking for. Good price."
"iPhone 12 mini","One afternoon I picked up my good old 6s and discovered...a brick. I needed a new (to me) phone quickly, so I ordered a renewed/refurbished 12 Mini. I live in the sticks, so overnight delivery just doesn't happen, but I was happy with 2nd day delivery. I find the 12 Mini is a good size for my hand."
"iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto me agrad√≥ que lleg√≥ como nuevo y con cargador de carga r√°pida"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks brand new, not a single scratch, and 100% battery health. But weird things have been happening.

First, I couldn‚Äôt activate this phone with my career‚Äôs online tool‚Äî one where you log into your account and enter the phone‚Äôs IMEI. This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process.

Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren‚Äôt on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version.

The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978. See screenshot.

I‚Äôve read that this is done by Apple to identify ‚Äúgray market‚Äù devices, devices refurbished by unauthorized resellers, and iPhones that were demo units.

This makes me wary that this phone may have been tampered with, compromised, or hacked.

Like I said it is cosmetically in perfect condition, I was even impressed! But I have to return this phone and buy brand new for my peace of mind.

Since it might just be my paranoia, I‚Äôm only knocking off one star. This renewed phone is for someone, just not me."
"iPhone 12 mini","Over all it's like new. The only one issue, is that there is a small scratch on the glass. If it didn't have that scratch, I would have given it 5 stars."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine in every detail, except battery life is not quite as long as desired."
"iPhone 12 mini","Ignore the smudges on the second photo, those are not scratches.

My boyfriend wanted a newer phone, we were nervous, we bought it anyway. The condition of this phone is AMAZING. He ordered the 64GB, blue. There are roughly 6 cosmetic issues and I don‚Äôt even want to call them cosmetic issues. They‚Äôre so tiny on the back of the phone, it looks like someone took a sewing needle and simply POKED the phone. They aren‚Äôt even noticeable unless you‚Äôre deliberately checking for imperfections and the phone is practically on your nose. I‚Äôve seen worse done with brand new phones from shipping.

Now, the new iOS updates allows you to go into settings to find non genuine parts like displays, batteries, cameras, etc. This phone doesn‚Äôt pop for a SINGLE off brand part. Every single part in this phone seems to fully check out to apple or simply have not even been replaced.

I even went farther and logged into my apple support. The phone was first purchased in 2020, and hasn‚Äôt had a single pop up there for unauthenticated parts either. Further boosting us into loving the idea that this phone is all Apple.

The camera works perfectly and the battery health is at 84% which is a great health rate for him, and a used phone in general.

The phone was also entirely unlocked. I didn‚Äôt have to pay anything to turn it on, I was able to use my old SIM card, and it was fully set up to my carrier MOMENTS after restarting the phone.

The only thing I didn‚Äôt check was the light in the sim port for water damage. But with how wonderful this phone is, I‚Äôm not even bothering taking the sim back out to check.

Extremely lucky buy, or extremely great sellers. Who knows, but we‚Äôre thankful.
Whoever this phone was bought from, amazing person. Whoever ‚Äúfixed‚Äù this phone, amazing person. We couldn‚Äôt be happier purchasing this. Especially it being the first time we bought refurbished, ever."
"iPhone 12 mini","So it‚Äôs a refurbished phone alright.

My complaints are‚Ä¶. Lines in the screen on a white background, phone over heats easily, and some people say they can‚Äôt hear me clearly on calls.

I like‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs battery is solid.
(I went from an iPhone 6, to a iPhone 12)

I think you can find a better phone for cheaper on other sights. I probably wouldn‚Äôt go this route again."
"iPhone 12 mini","I read some of the reviews about some of their other products and was skeptical but when I got the phone it was basically like new. No scratches, the battery life was 100%, no dents or anything. Thank you, I needed the phone really bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in excellent like new condition, battery is decent, 87% maximum capacity. Everything works as it should."
"iPhone 12 mini","I liked that the phone looks really good and looks brand new. What I did not like is that the battery is at 89% but it doesn‚Äôt matter to me"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was in desperate need of a new phone for a few months as my iPhone 8 was suffering from a broken charging port (wireless was the only way I could charge) and excessive battery drainage. Instead of dealing with my phone retailer and getting a new payment plan I decided to just buy this and put my current SIM card in.

The phone came in generic packaging with generic charging accessories. But I was able to transfer my data from my old phone to this one within an hour of receiving it.

The phone came with very very minor scratches on the back glass which isn‚Äôt an issue at all. Functionality was perfect, it felt like having a brand new phone. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the battery‚Äôs life was not at 100% so it does drain about halfway to 50% when I don‚Äôt charge it for about 10~ hours. Overall a great quick option if you need a new phone fast with no hassle."
"iPhone 12 mini","my phone came in almost pristine condition. so far, i have seen no problems that are super obvious. there are some scratches on the screen but not noticeable unless you specifically look for it under light. the battery condition came at 89% so it was pretty decent. i‚Äôm really happy with what i got! it looks pretty much like new and everything works perfect too!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my little phone. It‚Äôs paid for and mine idc who had it before me lol."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good. Only I don‚Äôt receive any key for Sim card removal"
"iPhone 12 mini","I picked 64gb cause I used to have 32 and oh my gosh it‚Äôs a life changer!! Any way the touch screen is really good the face recognition is spot on!!! And the battery life I just can‚Äôt start or this would be a 500 paged SA lol but overall it‚Äôs the best I really recommend and there wasn‚Äôt even a scratch on it üòÑ"
"iPhone 12 mini","Definitely worth the buy bought it for my lil bro he now uses it and there hasnt been any issues it is unlocked because now he‚Äôs not in the US and it works just fine with other Carriers"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this phone as a gift for someone. The person was super happy. Very good condition. Delivery was great."
"iPhone 12 mini","actually unlocked, thankfully. good quality. will update if i find anything wrong with it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ok!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The response time of the screen is a bit slow. I do not know why. Also, the processor is slow too. I have had Iphone SE 2 until september, which was way faster than this, and had a much better screen response time."
"iPhone 12 mini","At first I couldn‚Äôt find my package, but the phone is amazing, works 100%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with only 83 percent battery life how is this renewed. Scratched and dings and the screen is not OEM!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Item was shipped quickly. It was as described no scratches or cosmetic damage at all. Only negative if I had to put one down is when I checked battery condition it checked out at 94%. Still good but that‚Äôs the only reason I did not give a 5 star for the whole review. If I had the option I probably would put a 4.5 stars."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs a real apple iPhone so that‚Äôs a start. However, the battery life is meh and it overheats quite fast when in the car as I‚Äôm driving so I keep it in my lap that seems to help. Nevertheless, it works and that‚Äôs what I was hoping for when I bought it. Better than my SE maybe"
"iPhone 12 mini","I recommend the phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting delivery of my iPhone 12 mini until Friday; it came in the mail Wednesday, to my delight! With the exception of a little bit of dust lodged in the phone‚Äôs Silent Mode switch and in the earpiece grille, the phone looked like new, came wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap, and also came with a Lighting cord and a neat little charging brick, similar to the ones Apple makes. Battery capacity was at 87% which is not too far off from mint condition. I set up my phone, synced my iCloud information, inserted my SIM card, and I was good to go!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Got the phone, it works great, other than some IOS related software bugs and issues (when setting the phone up) it's great! I selected the ""good"" quality option when I purchased. There ARE some scratches and dents in the frame, none in the screen, to show you how big they are a photo is attached (the one in the picture by the charging port is one of the biggest ones I've found) battery came 87% original capacity and unlocked with all carriers, face ID works wonderfully"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was debating weather or not I wanted to write this. However I know how important it was for me to see real reliable reviews so here it is‚Ä¶This review is going to be about the quality of product they sent me. Not the phone itself but I will cover that too.First impressions,Came very poorly packaged. I was really worried the phone was going to be broken or just horrible. The phone was only protected by a small box. The phone was loose in the box and it was only protected by a bit of bubble wrap. I took the phone out and immediately I wasn‚Äôt impressed. The phone was dirty like really dirty. I took about 5 minutes of wiping it down until I was satisfied. Then I noticed the scratches‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me.Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I‚Äôd highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It‚Äôs worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable.Battery life is amazing. I‚Äôm a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false. I use Max brightness for about 7 hours on screen time and I still go to bed with around 20% battery."
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone, thinking it was a big risk with it being renewed. The day I got the phone, it came with the original screen protector and a charging cable. I loaded it up and it had 100% battery life and was very snappy. I will be doing this again when I need another phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","At 75 years old changing from an iPhone 6 to a 12 Has had its challenges but overall I found it pretty simple to set up. I have not carried a purse and years so I did not want to go to a bigger screen than I had to. The 12 mini still fits very well in my pocket and I like it very much. I‚Äôm still learning to navigate around, not having a home button is a bit different but I think I‚Äôm doing pretty good overall"
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratches at all, the camera and sound if perfect. Battery is 85%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good condition. So far everything works good."
"iPhone 12 mini","Blue tooth doesn‚Äôt work"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone, only issue is a heavy dent on a corner. It gets cover with the case. Still worth the value."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well overall but the phone was pretty dinged up around the edges"
"iPhone 12 mini","It will be 60 degrees out and HOT when plugged in and gives error message. I have done all recommendations of closing all programs, restarting etc. Nothing helps."
"iPhone 12 mini","The main reason I purchased used was because my last phone was a broken iPhone 6s Plus I received as a gift to repair. I repaired the screen, speaker, front and rear cameras, and battery and the phone became like new.Fast forward a few years and now that iPhone 6s Plus has become very dated. I took the risk of buying a renewed iPhone 12 mini because of 3 reasons: about the same usable screen size as iPhone 6s Plus; the much lower cost (~$200 cheaper than new); and I was confident that I could do some repairs on it if it were to fail. Received the phone ahead of the delivery date and it came with a USB-A Lightning cable (and I think a power brick, but I don't remember). There was just one very minor scratch on the front glass that is only noticeable with the screen off and if you really paid attention. Battery was over 90% max capacity and still lasts me the whole day.Very satisfied with the purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product well packaged, quickly delivered. Accurately described and ‚Äúworks like new‚Äù. Would definitely buy refurbished from this seller again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything seems to work fine so for my only issue is that it did not come with a SIM card tryna and without that I can‚Äôt activate the phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","The back camera glitches when I go to take a photo. It never focuses on what I click on or if I simply put the camera on a object it makes a weird noise and loses focus. This is very annoying and stops me from taking and videos or pictures."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is an upgrade for me from XR. So worth it! No scratches or dents. The battery life lasts 2 with lighter use. can't find one thing wrong with it. Very pleasantly surprised. It even arrived 2 days earlier than estimated. The camera in this little phone is amazing as well. I am very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","I would like the battery to have a higher percentage of charge, I received it with 87%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came in absolute perfect condition! The only problem was when I went to activate it with AT&T, they said it was blocklisted and suspended because the phone was reported as stolen 7 months ago. I had to return and buy a new phone. The new phone wasn‚Äôt stolen!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Esperaba mas vida util de la bateria, por el precio que pague, y la condicion seleccionada al comprar. Esteticamene OK, funcional OK , y Face ID OK."
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm always a little nervous about buying refurbished electronics after getting burned once. But this phone has exceeded my expectations. Other than a small scratch on the screen that isn't even noticeable unless at just the right angle in the light, this phone is pristine. The blue color is beautiful, and the mini is just the right size for me, as I was upgrading from a iPhone 7.PROS:Transferring my info from the previous phone was quick and easy. I just sat them next to each other, and the phone did all the heavy lifting. Sound quality is good, and apps open quickly and run efficiently. It took a little getting used to not having the fingerprint ID and home button, but the face ID is almost instantaneous. Photos are fantastic, and the detail is amazing. I have yet to learn all the new features, but the low light pictures are much improved, especially of storms. Voice recognition and autocorrect in text messages seem to be more accurate than my 7 as well.CONS:At times it is a little sluggish to wake up. It takes a couple tries before it swipes open. And Siri seems to have more difficulty understanding me or giving me accurate answers, but maybe it takes some time for it to get used to my voice.Overall, I am very pleased with this phone for the price. It's still higher than I like to pay, but refurbished was much cheaper, and it was a long past-due upgrade."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone as described excellent seller would definitely do business with AGAIN!!!! I personally like the smaller screens.most phones look like your carrying your T.v. set with you. I don‚Äôt need a 72 inch screen for a phone. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for Apple to get a phone that‚Äôs in my wrist or something a little more futuristic anyway. Until then this will do! Maybe look through Steve Jobbs old notes and come up with something different Apple your look/style is about 5 years past due. This is a 5 star seller thank you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","What a great way to save money and update my phone! I have had my Amazon Renew iPhone for about a month and have had no issues, works great and arrived just as described. Very pleased with my purchase!"
"iPhone 12 mini","it came in amazing condition and it looks brand new the battery came in 100% battery health!"
"iPhone 12 mini","El tel√©fono me lleg√≥ impecable pero era m√°s peque√±o de lo que cre√≠a, as√≠ que lo devolv√≠."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am surprised at how quick it arrived. The battery was at 94%. It was exactly as described. Thank you for a perfect transaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love love love my new phone. I always got really cheap phones because they‚Äôd break but now that I‚Äôm in a better place in my life this was a great deal for me to get the AT&T option which took my nano sim from my Alcatel. It was only $433 for the red att. No blemishes even except where the last person must‚Äôve dropped it maybe tiniest chip of the red there. The battery capacity lasts me all day long that‚Äôs what was wrong with my Alcatel it would charge and I would be worried in cities because it would die even charging. The iOS 15 added amazing updates. I got the zagg elite screen protector and can‚Äôt tell any difference in my visuality it‚Äôs easy to peel off the first couple tries and get rid of any air bubbles. The spigen case is amazing too beat priced case and doesn‚Äôt overlap the screen. Renewed is the way to go this tax season y‚Äôall"
"iPhone 12 mini","We tried Backmarket twice for a refurbished phone and did not have much luck and had to return both. Tried Amazon and it was perfect."
"iPhone 12 mini","It took me 3weeks for it to be activated with my carrier. Even though the phone was through them."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs a good phone but it came with a 86% battery health"
"iPhone 12 mini","Me agrado todo menos el precio y la novedad de que se oscurece la pantalla"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought 2 phones, one white and one blue, and both were in perfect condition. They look like brand new phones just pulled out of the Apple box. They both work like new. Set up was soooo easy. I understand not all purchases will be perfect through the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù process however, Amazon promises a 90 day return for all purchases if they don‚Äôt meet your standards. We are both very happy with our ‚Äúnew‚Äù phones!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It was pretty good quality for a great price they even answer back pretty fast. shipping was great 2 day earlier!! they get 4 stars for that !! Now my only issue was when I got it it was locked now that was anyoing but it happens so I understand I figure out how to unlock it myself and they texted they would help me to unlock so if that case ever arrives you should be fine other than that it was a fantastic buy Amazon thx üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone looks almost new without any visible scratches or dents. The battery capacity is at 87% well within the product descriptions. This iPhone costs close to $200 less than a new phone. Amazon will finance the phone with no interests via there VISA."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works perfect as advertised very satisfied"
"iPhone 12 mini","Brand new, refurbished where?"
"iPhone 12 mini","The product arrived in good condition and had no visible defects, although the display was slightly dirty. The phone works perfectly and setup was simple. However, after only a couple hours of use it was clear that the phone was nearly unusable due to the battery life. Although the stated battery capacity in the settings was above the specification in the product description (87%), actual usage showed far worse battery life. After only 2.5 hours of screen time of non-intensive activities, such as messaging and playing music, the battery had dropped from 67% to 4%. Additionally, sometimes when I checked the battery the percentage would have dropped 3-5% after only a couple of minutes. I also tried suggested ways to improve battery use, such as turning off 5G and background refresh, but none of these worked. I'm very disappointed as I was excited to get this phone at a reasonable price, but this was not up to the standards promised by the seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 Mini arrived with a small chip on the corner which is obscured by any normal phone case. Other than that perfect physical condition. Maximum battery life was at 80%. Other than that just like a new phone! Very happy with my purchase and glad to buy renewed. Would recommend to anyone looking to save $200-$300 on a phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone isn‚Äôt good condition face recognition works battery life is pretty good and the touchscreen as well everything works excellent"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought iPhone 12 mini (excellent condition). However, it has some scratches on it"
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs almost like new, but so much easier to hold and carry than my older iPhone XR. I‚Äôm very happy with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm happy with my new iPhone 12 mini but I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in UPS. The family was out for the day so naturally UPS left the package in my garage but they didn‚Äôt set it up high enough and a dog got ahold of the package. My brand new renewed phone now has a crack in the screen from the dog biting it. Luckily the phone is okay and the crack isn‚Äôt too bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","Even refurbished phones can look and run like brand-new I was kinda nervous because I‚Äôve always had issues with refurbished new homes‚Ä¶but mine and my son‚Äòs both were refurbished and you can‚Äôt even tell they are refurbished I just absolutely love them. amazing and have not given us any issues one bit so to sometimes put a little money back in your pocket go refurbished just look at all the details and everything and just go for the refurbished one because it will save not only money but you are still getting what you want and sometimes yes it doesn‚Äôt come in the original box but you are still getting what you want‚Ä¶for a lot cheaper tho so I will always shop on Amazon for everything including phones and will continue to give five stars everything I buy.!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent cosmetic appearance, battery life is at 80% which is in their stated range. Looks good to me."
"iPhone 12 mini","I like the camera quality"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone to buy outright. Don‚Äôt have monthly payments to worry about and I can choose what service I want. The touchscreen was a little sensitive at first. The face recognition is useful for not having to remember passwords. The battery doesn‚Äôt last long if you‚Äôre a power user so I would opt for the bigger ones next time. But great phone overall."
"iPhone 12 mini","no cracks or chips or scratches"
"iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llego como indican en la descripci√≥n, algunas personas tuvieron suerte y les llego a un 100% condici√≥n de bater√≠a, en mi caso fue 89% y bueno creo que puedo vivir con eso, siendo un equipo renovado, con lo dem√°s todo estuvo perfecto."
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone is in perfect conditions with 88% of health battery that it‚Äôs ok!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for the money, I had almost no scratches on the phone, at least that I could find, so for the look of the phone I would give it a 9/10, also with face recognition there are no problems, it works well and quickly, but it has a very bad battery, every week the battery deteriorates by 1%, so I don't know how it will perform in a few months, but so far I have no problems, so decide for yourself whether to buy it or no."
"iPhone 12 mini","Both phones I bought I purposely purchased from Decluttr Store after reading their reviews. They both were shipped and arrived quickly, both unlocked, 256 GB, and had no issues at all. One of the phones I got even still has a warranty on it. I also checked to make sure they were not stolen, and they were not. The phones themselves are great. I watched a guy online drop one like 10x from 9FT without a case on it and it survived fine. Sure I purchased a case and glass protector but I probably don't need either. I went from a 7 plus to this phone and really like how small it is. It reminds my of my old SE (the first edition). I would buy through Amazon again granted it's from a legit seller. Thanks again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Solid phone, very good, no noticeable scratches or scuffs, although a bit loose in the box it was perfectly fine once I opened it. It was provided with a cord and box and the only nit pick is that the battery life was at 95%Other than that it was definitely worth buying here and saving $200 rather than paying an extra 200 for the same phone, a box and 5% more battery life from apple"
"iPhone 12 mini","don't like that you can't be on YouTube the same time while you're browsing the Internet."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is my favorite model iPhone and fits in pocket. Battery easily lasts through the day. Face recognition is not great if you‚Äôre lying on your back."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting a like new product this phone, but based on Amazon‚Äôs description of their Renewed program (‚Äúprofessionally inspected‚Äù and ‚Äúexpertly refurbished‚Äù are two of the claims you see immediately when you browse their Renewed inventory) I expected the phone to be in better shape than it is. The screen is broken in a couple places and will need a replacement right away. I gave two stars because the phone is functional but I am disappointed that it didn‚Äôt have at least an intact screen. I did expect some physical imperfections on a refurbished product, but I feel like the screen is one of those things that really should be in good order, even when purchasing a refurbished product because of all the damage that can happen to a phone when the screen is not intact."
"iPhone 12 mini","Although this I-phone doesn't use the fingerprint to lock and unlock, the facial recognition is nice but it sometimes unlocks when I prefer it doesn't unlock, nor does it have the center button. There is a bar that appears at the bottom of the screen that does what the button used to do. To view which windows are open, just hold the bar and drag the window to the center of the screen and all open windows are visible. To close unwanted windows (which will also log you off an open account like a bank account), slide the screen up until it disappears. Lots of nice features that come with the phone and the camera takes much better pictures than my much older I-phone 5. Battery life lasts SOO much longer, too. I also appreciate the slightly larger screen, and the phone isn't much bigger than the i-phone 5. I love my new (refurbished) phone! It works great!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Had some problems on the post office side where the phone got sent back. They were super quick when I notified them of the problem and they resent the phone. Thank you for the great customer service!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works well"
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôve never owned a brand new car. Nearly new, under 50K miles‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the way to go. I am now of the same mindset with iPhones. For $500 less than list price, I bought an iPhone 12-mini with 128 gb and it‚Äôs a great phone. I‚Äôm really happy with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","didn‚Äôt like it, I expected at least the battery life with 95%"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is fully unlocked, it worked perfectly in Ecuador and everything was perfect, as a new one."
"iPhone 12 mini","Quede muy incomforme, muy peque√±o y adem√°s me env√≠an un cargador disfuncional y un clip de papeler√≠a (ni siquiera un original)"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone was almost like new.i am very happy with the phone.i feel it was a good feal."
"iPhone 12 mini","People might say this is broken or useless I bought this for my son for his birthday and the phone was in perfect condition it had some fingerprints but it was alr and it still was 100% battery and no dents or no bad condition it's in perfect condition person who delivered it hand it to me so it was safe"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived within the provided timeframe. It was in great condition and fully functional as advertised. It had great battery life remaining and it was reasonably priced compared to the same type of phone being sold on Amazon by other sellers. The seller responded quickly to our questions."
"iPhone 12 mini","In the reviews they are saying that battery is going the whole day, it‚Äôs not. Middle of the day it will be %30 percent, it is almost impossible to use it for whole day.*i don‚Äôt play games"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini off Amazon and I was really worried about buying phones online but I would have to say it was works like brand new. It came in a regular shipping box with a cheap charger. I only wished I had got an original iPhone charger but it still works just as any would. The battery life is good. I was worried with it being a renewed phone that the battery life would suck but it‚Äôs actually pretty decent for now. Will update if I have any future problems. But I would suggest this sale to anyone. It‚Äôs so worth it. It‚Äôs slick. Small and easy to handle"
"iPhone 12 mini","Espero dure es mi primera vez comprando celular en Amazon se ve de buena calidad en perfectas condiciones me vino esta precioso"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is great just like buying from the apple store"
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno practico"
"iPhone 12 mini","I wanted a small smartphone so I decided on this one and I am happy that I bought. It has all the features as the larger one but at a smaller size. The color is nice and what can I say , its a iPhone and is a great phone with a operating system that I like. All in all I am happy that I purchased the iPhone 12 Mini."
"iPhone 12 mini","the battery capacity of the phone is at 83%. basically needs to be replaced which is what im dealing with now... wish i would have known this was the case to begin with - i dont think i would've bought it. Otherwise the phone is in decent condition - everything seems to work."
"iPhone 12 mini","The renewed product was in a nice package when it arrived. The phone itself has one or more dots on the edges of the phone that indicates the iPhone is used. Having used the phone for a week, it has been running good."
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition; would recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Peque√±os ara√±azos alrededor pero es normal por ser refurbished. La pantalla 10/10"
"iPhone 12 mini","Up until this purchase I was using an Iphone 7 with a screen cracked in every direction. It was a great phone but alas my ears getting cut when on the phone grew old. I'm on a sustainability journey, trying to reduce my e-waste and offset what others are doing, so I opted for a renewed Iphone, and I'm glad I did!This phone came in great condition, all aside from a scratch on the screen. Since I was in it for the better camera, I didn't care about blemish like this. The battery life is amazing, there have been no technical glitches or issues, and I didn't bring a new piece of landfill technology into the world. Highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a cheaper, more sustainable, alternative to brand new $1,000+ iphone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty hesitant to buy this phone especially since it was my first ever time buying a renewed/refurbished item. I got mine from the seller O'Crack and all I can say is WOW.The phone arrived at the earliest date which was really nice.The phone has not a single scratch anywhere and I looked thoroughly. Everything works perfectly and even the box that it came in was a nice box. The accessories it came with were also very nice and not too cheap feeling.In conclusion the phone could easily pass as brand new and I'm definitely buying from this seller in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, however much too small - I'm always looking for it so I replaced it with iPhone 13."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks as described. Perfect condition and working order. No problem at all."
"iPhone 12 mini","It was perfect. We all feel a little worry when we buy this type of products not in the official store, but It was all good. Obviously, is not a new phone. In this case it have a little, almost non perceptible, scratch at the back and battery was 91% but it is normal for what i was expecting. The price is so good comparing other sites that sells the same product for much higher prices"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came to me in very good condition. It looks and works as brand new. At first the screen was dim and it didn‚Äôt let me adjust it until I cut the phone off and back on. No issues."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is ok but not great. It was sent without the latest software update and the charge doesn't work. The battery is only charging to 75%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks unused. Not one scratch on it which surprised me because it came in a USPS box wrapped in minimal bubble wrapped and the box was damaged. Had a charging cube and a cable. Battery life was 100%. I‚Äôm loving the smaller side phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","came without scratches, literally a brand new iphone 12 mini.my friends laugh that it's small but i love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","As for the phone itself, I love the 12 mini's size, the screen looks great, it's just so much more pleasant to handle than the other, much taller flagships.But as to the condition... the listing is technically correct. Mine came with a hairline crack on the back glass' bottom right corner, and some scratches on the top right frame, but ""when held at arm's length,"" you can't see those things. Even though it'll always live in a case and I'll never see those flaws, it still might be a deal-breaker.The screen and camera lenses are perfect, not even a scratch on them, so that's a plus.The phone also works flawlessly, all buttons and functions work with no issues.Just be aware that when you buy ""renewed,"" there will most definitely be varying degrees of condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone arrived with the original screen protector still in place, zero scratches, and 100% battery capacity. It looks brand new to me. The phone was unlocked as described. Buy with confidence from this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great product, great service!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm always someone looking for a deal, and this seemed like a great one. Ordering refurbished phones from Amazon has never been an issue, and I desperately needed a new one. When I got the iPhone, it wasn't even that secure in its box. I could hear and feel it move around, which didn't make me feel good knowing what I had spent. The phone is currently in the mail being returned because the battery was either no good or not an Apple battery.I had a flurry of alerts pop up when I turned it on, saying there was a ""foreign part identified"" as the battery part. Within the first day, I was already having issues. The battery wouldn't hold a charge and would restart every few minutes. Even a 2-minute phone call was difficult because the phone kept restarting. I suppose there is an essential lesson in this: it pays to get New sometimes because it will last you in the long run. Now using a new iPhone 13 mini and couldn't be happier!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazon said it was lost in the mail, and then it just showed up at my door 20 days later after I had already bought a different one. It was cheaper than the one I had bought, so I tested it to see if it worked with my Verizon prepaid network, and it did not. I was excited for this phone, but disappointed in wait time, lack of response from seller, and that it wasn‚Äôt compatible. On the bright side, it only had one small dent in left corner of phone, cosmetic issue. I looked at the battery life and it was at 80% of the original battery capacity. It turned on and worked fine. If it had worked on my network, I might have kept it maybe. It‚Äôs only 100ish dollars to get one that has full battery capacity and no cosmetic issues, so I went with my new unlocked iPhone from Apple. Do yourself a favor and just do that."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well but it is very small"
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived fast, with 99% battery health, not a noticeable scratch anywhere, unless something microscopic that I didn't care to look for. Looks and feels amazing. Got the 128gb for 500 doing18months payment, has 90 day warranty and is new or like new and it actually came with a charger head, what a deal! Just the packaging was wack, sending my secsi phone inside a little ziploc bag with no padding inside a mediocre box. Do not disrespect my iphone like that üò¨ Get you one!"
"iPhone 12 mini","the device showed no signs of wear and the battery health is at 100%. Very pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone on my trip to the US, I bought it unlocked to use in Colombia where I live, it came early and in perfect condition, no scratches, the screen works perfectly, it was promised to came with more than 80% of battery health it came with 89%. It looks like new, and for sure I am recommending this option to my friends."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm writting the review on this phone btw, I love it! Had for about 4 months now and I have no problem at all!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived on time. It did not come in the original box but that didn‚Äôt matter to me. The phone looks brand new. The front screen and back of the phone had zero scratches or marks. Both cameras work great with no issues. Battery life is at 100%. Really happy I took the chance on this product!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent"
"iPhone 12 mini","Small footprint"
"iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately the size of this phone is smaller than I would have liked. My fault, so I'll have to make do with it until my wife decides to upgrade."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received was immaculate. Slipped my new SIM card in, seamless transfer of apps etc. phone even came with a glass screen protector already installed, and we ALL know installing that screen protector is the worst part of setting up a phone. Very happy."
"iPhone 12 mini","everything worked good excetp the power button was a little hard to press down at first it was like somebody spiled something on the power button but other than that everything was fine"
"iPhone 12 mini","The packaging was ok and it felt like refreshed, like new. The charger is generic and cheap quality. The phone does get hot after charging which may indicate some issues with battery or charging cable itself. Otherwise the setup was straight forward, credit goes to Apple for having the feature to upgrade by NFC/Airplay and synching up all of storage from old phone to new device?"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was sceptical about a refurbished phone, but this one is still holding up and my mom is not a heavy apps user. So far so good, and it's looks brand new"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ten√≠as mis dudas de si comprarlo pero con El Paso del tiempo me a funcionado de maravilla y no me a presentado ninguna falla recomendable no lo pensar√© 2 veces antes de volver a comparar algo as√≠"
"iPhone 12 mini","All is excellent with the phone and service from the seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","bought this phone back in february and has been perfect for me since then"
"iPhone 12 mini","I had a 6 and it was crashing so I purchased this mini 12. I figured it‚Äôll be minor mishaps but it‚Äôs just like my 6 this mini 12 is crashing as well. I want a refund but don‚Äôt want to go without a phone so sucks for me. 1-5 I‚Äôll rate ‚Äúthe look‚Äù a 4 there was a small crack on the phone that has spread. The phone itself glitches. It blacks out then I have to unlock it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone- no defects that I have found."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little hesitant when ordering an iPhone of all things from Amazon. However I was thoroughly impressed when it showed up! Shipping was extra fast and came quicker than expected (within 1-2 days)!Came with everything pictured: Phone, wall plug, charging cable, and a SIM card remover tool. The phone was in excellent condition with no scuffs or scratches. Everything is working properly and the battery health is at 100%.I love how small and compact the 12 mini is compared to the Pro. Fits into pockets perfectly."
"iPhone 12 mini","Nothing its amazing"
"iPhone 12 mini","I understand this is a small phone and the battery is smaller hence the battery life is not the same as a big phone. Little disappointing, not the phones fault. The size of the phone is small but it will fit in the console of my car. The first thing I did when I got the phone was to increase the size of the text. The face recognition is great, no problems at all. The value for the money was great! Very easy to transfer all my data from my iPhone 6."
"iPhone 12 mini","it‚Äôs pretty cool, looks like a new. good packing and battery life is %87 !"
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone came earlier than they said which was a plus. It came in good condition and even 100% battery life except that the mic would buzz every time I recorded. I tried resetting the phone and going through the settings but nothing worked. I contacted the seller to get it replace. They communicated really well and sent my a replacement and the problem was fixed."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was surprised when the iPhone arrived much earlier and in much better condition that I expected. It looks like a new phone. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived faster than I expected and in perfect condition. I saw the reviews about the scratches and was a little nervous but the phone arrived fully unlocked, looking and working like brand new. This is only day 1, but I will update if anything changes"
"iPhone 12 mini","Came in earlier and no defects or scratches. Brand new and I‚Äôm very happy easy set up and transfer from my older iPhone. SIM card removal tool was included with charging cord and cube. 12 mini is fast in all apps even in texting and battery life maintains well. Glad I found this seller at a good price, well worth it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I have been very impressed with my new phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","El tel√©fono vino con varias rayas, no est√° en perfecto estado como otros tel√©fonos"
"iPhone 12 mini","El estado de la bater√≠a es una decepci√≥n para m√≠, con lo dem√°s apariencia y funcionalidad cumple con lo descrito"
"iPhone 12 mini","I received this phone recently and it was in amazing working order. Looked and felt brand new with 100% battery health! Shout out to eKings (Amazon Seller) for their prompt delivery, processing, and an extremely quality product. Would buy from them again!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Software needed updating, which turned out to be more difficult than needed"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with 100% battery capacity and no smudge or scratches. The packaging was questionable but fine. So far so good I have no complaints."
"iPhone 12 mini","Un gran regalo para mi novia, pens√≥ que era nuevo pero la caja gen√©rica lo delat√≥, a√∫n as√≠ es una gran compra si no te interesan los manuales, la caja y el cargador original"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone for on the go. 5g and has all the options if you don‚Äôt mind missing out on the high tech pro camera. Easy Swap of the sim card and everything worked well."
"iPhone 12 mini","I haven‚Äôt expected to get an iPhone in such great shape!!! The battery life is 100% which is awesome and no issues have detected so far. Reach out to the seller who also put the protection screen on my iPhone and gave the charger cable. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase! üëçüèª"
"iPhone 12 mini","Enough said. Watch a pros and cons video for analysis of the phone. From my experience this has been exactly ehat i need. After switching to the 10 from 5s i missed my 5s size dearly. Fast forward 4-5 years and i see this is a thing, i bought it and will never look back."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone worked like a charm with straight talk service. I like that it‚Äôs 128gig of memory and the 5G works in my area. This is the second phone I bought from Amazon and will buy another phone from Amazon when I‚Äôm ready for a new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I have bought refurbished phones before and always have been pleased. I am glad I took the slight risk with this one. The only noticeable difference between this and a brand new iPhone is the packaging and the charging cable, which made no difference to me. The phone itself is a huge improvement for me, as I upgraded from an iPhone 5. Battery life is great. I am able to go nearly three days on a single charge. The Apple Car Play is also very nice on this iPhone. The google maps and Spotify interfaces are much better than the Car Play on iPhone 5. And what is there to say about the camera besides unbelievable high quality! Splurge for a gimbal and your video will be Hollywood ready."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love how this is a tiny bit smaller than my old 6, but yet the display is bigger. I like how this fits in a pocket, even in its Otterbox Defender. It came with a handy belt clip. Now I can run all my apps that required 13 IOS or higher, I was out of memory on the 6. Face recognition is nice to help avoid having to put in my password every time."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks good. No scratches or other blemishes.Functions very well. Good touch screen and all apps work fine.Battery life in use is very good. Shows still has 80% of battery capacity (as advertised).Happy with it as a replacement and step up from previous iPhone. Glad I waited a few extra months until the #13 was released and got this at a still lower price. Worth that extra wait."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery life is definitely better than my iPhone 6s, but I still have to use a portable phone charger when I am out all day."
"iPhone 12 mini","No free return shipping. Scratches all over face. Now have to pay $8 to ship it back!"
"iPhone 12 mini","very good."
"iPhone 12 mini","El reconocimiento f√°cil a veces falla, la bater√≠a vino al 94%"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love the size, battery lasts all day and haven‚Äôt had any problems with it! Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great Refurbished Phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Awesome works great no scratches or dents looks brand new"
"iPhone 12 mini","The Phone has a huge scratch on the top speaker, also, the speaker sounds bad and not bad for the science of the mini, but sound like it was bad repaired. But the cameras and the data works well. Hope this help you and beware of the fact that is ""renewed""."
"iPhone 12 mini","When I got it and turned it on the battery was at 91% and it‚Äôs supposed to be at 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","UPDATE: it‚Äôs May 16th, 2022 and I still have this phone. It works just as it did when I bought it! It‚Äôs in great shape!Hello, my name is Alyssa! I bought this phone about a month and a half ago and absolutely love it! I have no problems with it whatsoever! The battery capacity was 100% efficient, so it charges just as it should. There are no random shut offs or heating up of the phone! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful in person and easy to use! I would definitely recommend this product to you! I‚Äôm 19 and needed something affordable because my old phone (iPhone 7) broke, and, I‚Äôm also paying for college."
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing great condition not a scratch on it also came earlier than expected also was unlock I was able to put my own sim worked like a charm thank you so much will order from this seller again even came with a charge such a plus thank you !"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is amazing for its price and overall a great phone. The only caveat is that this phone is very susceptible to randomly losing data signal despite my surrounding peers not suffering any similar issue."
"iPhone 12 mini","I bout this phone as a replacement for my son an it hasn‚Äôt let me down yet he has not complained about anything"
"iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love my new phone, thank you so much! This seems like a brand new phone to me and it arrived way sooner than it said it would. I am very grateful for that. As far as looks, I cannot tell it was used at all. For the price and it being unlocked, this is incredible. I was able to set it up with Straight Talk (Walmart‚Äôs prepaid service) and everything activated and transferred over perfectly. Merry Christmas to Me!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with no noticeable damage and 97% battery life. This seller is amazing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","phone looks great, but I was hoping to continue my one handed operation from my SE. but the screen is too big. I also missed the home button. i‚Äôll buybthe SE 3 instead"
"iPhone 12 mini","It arrived on time and everything seemed great, battery health said 100% so i was very happy about that. BUT it doesn‚Äôt even last a day (when in specifics it says up to 15 hours), i charged to 100% this morning (10 am), it‚Äôs 6 pm and it is already at 11% which i don‚Äôt think is good. I‚Äôll keep monitoring but i think that maybe I‚Äôll have to ask for a return‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 12 mini","It renewed but felt like brand new, and came with a charger in the box which new iPhone don't have"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought it about a week ago and it just came in today- it was almost as it wasn‚Äôt even used. There wasn‚Äôt any scratches on the screen, camera or the black glass. It came in bubble wrap (not the original iPhone box) and it came with an apple iPhonecharger and a regular non branded power brick. When I powered on the phone and set it up I was surprised to see the maximum battery capacity was 100%! I‚Äôm not sure if I got really lucky or what. Phone isn‚Äôt as small as you think it would be. I would recommend if you are trying to get this phone but want a cheaper price."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical at first with getting it, have been waiting to get my hands on one of these for a strong minute. Once I got it, I loved it! No marks, scratches or anything. Totally worth it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Shipping was a little slow but the phone is like a brand new one, not even a scuff on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I""m so upset I have not even had very long but just long enough to not be able to return it. I""m out the amount I paid for it. I stopped woking properly at the 3 month mark. When I tried to return it, it gave me apple's number for support. I can't get my money back, and I can't return it. I""m stuck with a phone I can't text on, and the screen bounces."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived with a chip in the frame around the screen. The exposed metal is easily visible from arm's length, but a case will cover it. The screen was obviously replaced but has no obvious cracks or scratches.Cosmetics aside, it works fine and I'm going to keep it."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good just has a ton of scratches around the frame and screen. Also the battery is 80% capacity which is weird. When the packaging says 95%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought a renewed Iphone, and I got a almost brand new phone. said battery was over 80% and it was. Said it would come in 2 days and it did. I doubted it at first but it delivered. So very solid product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in really good condition, almost like new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I got the iPhone 12 Mini AND IT WAS TERRIBLE! The package it came in looked like something you‚Äôd buy off some sketchy site. The phone came with no cosmetic damage. But i could even get past the activation screen. I tried everything. Even getting a brand new SIM card for the phone. Nothing. The phone wouldn‚Äôt unlock and i took it to the apple store and my carrier store. Nothing. I‚Äôve spent two days slaving over this phone begging it to work. Nothing. So i will not be purchasing from Amazon Renewed again. Normally I‚Äôm a very relaxed person since i work in customer service, but the fact that this phone is acting like it‚Äôs a locked phone and that it doesn‚Äôt even have the bypass part the apple installs. SUCKS. I just want my refund and nothing else to do with Amazon renewed. They can have this phone back as it doesn‚Äôt even work the way it‚Äôs advertised as."
"iPhone 12 mini","I ordered the item before checking the reviews, then had second taught about this item. However the item was exactly as described and I‚Äôm pleased with my order, customer service is great too. Highly recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Loved it. A little smaller than I am used to ( was gifted to me). But, it was wonderful"
"iPhone 12 mini","Received this phone, activated with my carrier, went to make a phone call and could barely hear anything, activated speaker and still could not hear it, volume was turned up all the way too. Returned it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Lo compr√© re acondicionado y Est√° como nuevo"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in good condition. The Battery life is good, but not as long as I expected. The shipper failed to include a Charger, Cable, and SIM card tool. Phone functions okay. Camera and Face Recognition, work okay, A good value for the money. I might buy another one from them."
"iPhone 12 mini","N/a"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is like new, works fine, easy to set up."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came looking brand new and works with no problems. Whereas my previous renewed phone had a problem with the speaker, this one works great and no scratches on the phone. Touch screen works fine too."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini was a very good option. Everything function very well. Any problem at this moment (1 Month)Everything ok with the seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love it, way cheaper then buying new. Screen has 2 micro scratches that you can‚Äôt even see when powered on. Two edges were slightly roughed up but once I put a case on it you can‚Äôt even tell. Would fully recommend to anyone looking for a new phone that won‚Äôt break the bank."
"iPhone 12 mini","everything was near perfect. only thing was a tiny scratch on the back that‚Äôs barely noticeable. The battery was 96% and everything else works perfectly definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a budget iphone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Compre dos celulares de estos uno para mi y otro para mi hija y estamos encantadasLlegaron bien empaquetados no con caja originalSin marcas ni rasgaduras buena est√©tica con muy buena cara de 100%Me gusta son c√≥modos de cargar no grandes para mi perfectos"
"iPhone 12 mini","This is just all around wonderful fun I love the size. Everything functions as it should takes great pictures I just really like it"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is as good as you‚Äôd expect on the surface literally nothing wrong with it other than the speakers, if anyone calls me I can‚Äôt understand anything they say unless I put it on speaker and ever those are not the best."
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone was supposed to have 80% of new battery life, but it doesn't even hold a charge for one day with normal use."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with only tinyyyy very very shallow scratches on the back that were only visible if you really squinted at them. Additionally, the battery capacity is 100%. The phone works perfectly. The one thing is that the packaging it came in was pretty sketchy. It was shipped in one large box with bubble wrap on top of it. Like the phone, loose with only film on it, was sitting at the bottom of the box with just bubble wrap and those puffy inflated things on top of it. Risky packaging but thankfully the phone didn't seem damaged by transit at all."
"iPhone 12 mini","I received my phone in perfect state, with just some tiny scratches that aren't really recognizable at first glance. It works terrific, the screen is intact, and the battery health state is at 100%. I would definitely recommend it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Absolutely love it the red is not a red like the iPhone 11 it‚Äôs like a iPhone XR coral overall impressed!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came as advertised. It had some minor scratches on right side of screen, but nothing to cry about. The glass screen protector actually hid them. Came with 100% battery capacity, which actually had me surprised! There were no scratches on the sides or back, just some dust. Phone powered right on, and every single feature works. I like the fact that it fits nicely in one hand, and is really fast. The seller responded quickly to my questions, was polite, and the package actually arrived 1 day earlier than I had anticipated! Highly recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I desperately needed a new phone and then I read about Amazon Renewed. I was not sure about buying from them but I saw they had a 90 day return policy so I went ahead with the purchase. I have had the phone now for about 2 weeks and it's working just fine. I could not tell it from new. Best of all it's unlocked, so I am not tied to Verizon anymore should I decide to switch and try another carrier."
"iPhone 12 mini","Best purchase!!! I was skeptical at 1st but hands down so happy I purchased it, I had to default the storage space when I got it, but once that was cleared I had no problems and still no problems‚Ä¶. Unlocked and everything"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is very compact and easy to use"
"iPhone 12 mini","I fit in mint condition. Even came with a screen protector and wall charger.So far so good!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 mini was to replace my iPhone SE. I was expecting scratches and dings but this phone looks and feels brand new. I saved about $200 dollars compared to buying it new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I wanted to keep a smaller sized phone (for my back pocket) and thought this would be a great model. The price for the quality of phone and camera are amazing."
"iPhone 12 mini","Not bad overall, it came in Chinese, but it was easy to change the language back. Overall good value, minimal blemishes on phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien pero quisiera cambiarlo con el m√°s grande se puede???"
"iPhone 12 mini","I very much dislike that the listing said renewed but the phone came in a box that was totally smashed inside of its shipping container, inside the box was the cheapest 3rd party cable I'd ever seen that DID NOT work, the phone was totally covered in sticky nasty filth, the screen had a screen protector on it that was shattered, and the screen has a small chunk of glass missing out of it, and the battery lasts about 6hrs while running nothing other than iOS with absolutely no use, with bluetooth and wifi both turned off. I wish the listing had been honest about what the state of the phone was as I would have likely purchased somewhere else."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is my first iPhone since 2016. This has minimum scratches and works great. This has a very clear screen and very beautiful. Love it and will probably order another for my daughter."
"iPhone 12 mini","Pretty happy for what I received. Came like new and camera is definitely an upgrade from my previous iPhone 7. Plus I love mini series which is why I waited so long for Apple to come out with a phone this size and back to the square body design."
"iPhone 12 mini","There are no noticeable scratches and the device came in like new! highly recommend if you want a secondhand device!"
"iPhone 12 mini","There were no visible scratches, dings-looks like a new phone. Easy to set up and transfer everything from my old phone. Definitely would recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks and works well! Very satisfied"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered on time and packaged well. It came in ""pristine"" condition with 100% battery health. would buy from this vendor again. I recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little sketched out by the lack of reviews for the product. I also thought, ""how is it possible to get a refurb of the 12 if it's brand new?"" but it arrived today and I'm super relieved. I read someone else's review that said it was legit and I took a leap of faith. So happy I did! It was delivered a day early and is in pristine condition, haven't seen a single scratch on it. I know it's only day 1 but overall I'm glad I made the purchase and you have no reason to worry. Great price and I was able to finance it with an amazon card to pay it off slowly."
"iPhone 12 mini","It came 3 days earlier than expected which i was happy about. There are some scratches on the screen but I don‚Äôt mind since it is renewed. Other than that everything is good. The battery health is at 100%. I just have to get used to the size since I have been using the xr. üòÇ"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, and came in perfect condition. Highly recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","OK Folks, I really mean what I say: I received an IPhone 12 mini, which was advertised as ‚Äûrenewed‚Äú with little / tiny flaws ‚Ä¶ I did not see one of them. It is literally new , battery health was 100% and everything worked super well. I traded in my IPhone XR and I will update this review when Amazon gives me the money promised. But so far , it‚Äôs an amazing phone for an amazing price (renew-discount + trade in ) . I can highly recommend to buy ‚Äûrenewed‚Äú from this experience"
"iPhone 12 mini","This is the 3rd Amazon renewed iPhone I‚Äôve purchased. iPhone looks brand new. No issues. Great value!Battery health at 85% upon arrival. A bit lower than other renewed iPhones I‚Äôve bought, but still good."
"iPhone 12 mini","The iphone12 mini received appeared 99% new.My complaint is the speaker quality is poor.The sound is ok, but the quality is not nearly as good as a proper iphone12mini.I would not buy this again. Instead I would just buy a new iPhone12 mini.It's ok & functional...not too bad.Delivery was quick."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my new phone. It looks brand new. The battery life is 100% and everything works perfectly. There are no scratches and it's beautiful. I'd recommend buying it."
"iPhone 12 mini","A gift for my dota...apparently don't want it...reason...too small...since she has been using standard size..."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is amazing but came extremely late. Was packed poorly. Came with original lightning cable and sim tool!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Beware. These phones are not new. I knew this before purchasing, but you would have expected the seller to check ALL functions of the phone before placing it on the market. Right? Instead of returning the item, I will have to pay to get it fixed. Maybe a discount is in order here since this item was not üíØ %?"
"iPhone 12 mini","The back camera doesn't work.. it don't hold a charge long enough and it frozen up on me 2 twice"
"iPhone 12 mini","Honestly the reviews have me really nervous however my experience with shipping was great it actually came faster than I thought and but and there are no cracks or scratches in the phone works great"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived on time and had only a very very small scratch on the front screen. That being said the scratch is hardly noticeable. The phone work flawlessly and has been my Daly driver for months now."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs small fits in my pocket just what I need."
"iPhone 12 mini","phone will not stay on for more than 15 min at a time. ironically im within days of the warranty. Phone will not connect to LTE or wifi. Phone only acts somewhat properly when plugged into the charger but typically cycles one of two problems i've mentioned. The phone looks brand new otherwise and has not been subject to significant damage."
"iPhone 12 mini","Only thing is sometimes gets to hot but with continued use"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little nervous about buying a renewed phone but reviews for the most part were very positive and the price was reasonable for a new iPhone. So, I went ahead and have been very pleased. There wasn‚Äôt a scratch on it anywhere and the battery charges to 100%. I am not a fan of big phones that I can‚Äôt get in and out of my pockets easily, so the mini is just right for me. It‚Äôs just a tad smaller than my old Samsung Galaxy S6."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works as advertised. I think it is a good value for the money, but I wish it was $100 cheaper. Fac recognition is working well. It is a little slow sometimes."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was very pleased came with 100% battery life. There were no scratches. Phone was unlocked. I have metro it was very easy to get my line active. Color was as described. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews on products but this one was important I want to let everyone know it‚Äôs legit and you can rest easy."

"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, great customer service."
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought this phone to add someone on my line. Just bought a SIM card and all good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with a dent on the corner where the camera is. It did not come with original apple charger. The phone was also dirty."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good shipping logistics. The only difficulty I had was finding accessories for the 12 mini. The speakers are good, it charges quickly and haven't had many freeze issues with it. I don't like the swipe features but eventually I'll get used to it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Fast delivery. Well-packaged product. Product in excellent condition. Everything is working fine. Approved!"
"iPhone 12 mini","i liked the fact that it was easy to set up."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was nervous ordering a renewed phone, but it came seemingly brand-new, 100% battery, and not a single scratch on it. Looks and functions great, thanks REXI!It didn't have the original box (which I don't care about anyway), but had the charging cable and the thingy to open the SIM card slot.Packaging was very secure, the phone was in an air-filled plastic sleeve, secured in a box, inside the outer box.Overall, would recommend!"

"iPhone 12 mini","Great refurbished phone. Only a small scratch on the screen barely noticeable. Everything works. Battery was as described around 85% capacity"
"iPhone 12 mini","So far I love this phone. Arrived sooner than expected. The battery life is unbelievable especially compared to my last iPhone. After a couple of days it still has not reached below 50%. The face recognition makes it so much faster to unlock. Feels more secure too. All in all a great phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Reviewing from Australiaüá¶üá∫ here.An absolutely stunning, mighty, and compact iPhone to own! Arrived two days early. Literally brand new as the battery health's at 100% with zero charge cycle. NO cosmetic damage or signs at all, and most importantly it works with the CDMA networks!Highly recommended for anyone outside the States not only as this model is fully unlocked but also that it features a large groove on the right side for the mmWave antenna (For the most optimal coverage of 5G)."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came in perfect physical condition, not one blemish. Also came a day early, however I did expedite shipping.. The only issue so far is it didn‚Äôt come with a screen protector.. I can‚Äôt remember if this was detailed or not, but I did see several customers say they received one. If I would have known I wasn‚Äôt going to, I would have been better prepared as the phone isn‚Äôt insured.."
"iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llega en excelentes condiciones y a√∫n con garant√≠a Apple, vida √∫til de la bater√≠a al 100%, recomendado !!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received works perfectly at 98% battery health. The only real negative is that the back glass had some small scratches. Honestly, unless it‚Äôs prime shipping and free returns, I won‚Äôt buy another used phone on Amazon. It‚Äôs too much of a gamble for something so expensive."
"iPhone 12 mini","Do not buy it lower quality do not come with Apple box"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone comes with 100% of battery health, just like new one"
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm happy with my purchase overall. But was pleasantly surprised when the Face recognition worked in a very low light situation. This is my second IPhone but it‚Äôs been the first in years. Am liking the functionality better than Android."
"iPhone 12 mini","Exelente celular parece nuevo,y muy buena tienda"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great buy works good thank you."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. Minor cosmetic issues but well worth the price and quick delivery"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived sooner than expected through fedex signature service. It came in a different package and the charger is not the original. But that was specified at the purchase. So far my daughter is enjoying her Christmas gift without complaints."
"iPhone 12 mini","El celular es hermoso, pero se escucha muy bajo"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone so much and it was sch a great price. Honestly, can not tell it was refurbished!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Super fast, great size and fab camera. Facial recognition is so sweet."
"iPhone 12 mini","Really good, looks new and uses like new"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt get the phone it‚Äôd be scratched, but the phone came brand new. 100% battery life, no scratches no cracks. It shipped within a week as well. Definitely recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","Battery while on low power only lasts until 12:00 noon. Says max battery capacity is 83%Touchscreen is hit or miss depending on battery life. (Have to tap over and over and still doesn't work)Constantly crashing and resetting. I was looking through my photos and it closed itself and went to the home screen.Very disappointed in the quality control."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little skeptical about a renewed phone, but it turned out to be amazing I can definitely certify the battery life, face recognition and the value for money."
"iPhone 12 mini","It's an amazing phone. Finally a flagship spec device on a small form factor. I Have been waiting years for this. Minus 1 start for the ""red"" model because it's not actually red. It's more of a corral. Had to return it and get the blue instead"
"iPhone 12 mini","First time I had very bad experience with a refurbished phone. Buttons and some functions are not working at all - and I probably didn't discover all of the disfunction yet.The side button doesn't work what makes it impossible to switch the phone of or use Siri. Photos can't be send from the library via WhatsApp and other apps. The battery is only good for one day maximum. And if you consider that the price is nearly as high as a new one that are things that are not very acceptable.Sad for me that I can not send it back as I am now in Costa Rica for work with no possibility to exchange it. Really sucks!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works good for cheap , it's legit"
"iPhone 12 mini","Yego mi pedido en tiempo y forma satisfecho"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo correcto, como nuevo, nivel de bater√≠a 90%"

"iPhone 12 mini","No complaints. Its nice to have a new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I have small hands and was a big fan of the iPhone 5 size. I‚Äôm glad they brought it back"
"iPhone 12 mini","Haven‚Äôt had any problems or malfunctions, other than cord connections. It won‚Äôt accept certain cords, even certified ones. I don‚Äôt like the microphone placement. Idk where it is, but a lot of my videos become muffled."
"iPhone 12 mini","only 87% battery!!!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good but when plugged into a charger it heats up fairly hot. So I‚Äôm assuming this was refurbished display unit. I had to return it due to that reason. Other than that the item looked brand new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition"
"iPhone 12 mini","This thing is like brand new battery health is 99% amazing for the price!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition worked great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I've been trying to put a new sim card in my Iphone 12 mini and it's not even unlocked, when I called Apple it says that it is connected to US cellular and I call US cellular and they cant help me they just tell me I have to get the person who's name is on the US cellular account to unlock it. This is BS the phone works great but what good is it if I can't even use it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratch, 100% battery, not Apple charger but that is to be expected. Would buy renewed again."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone met my expectations"
"iPhone 12 mini","Product was exactly as described; as new."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was great until I travelled out of my home city. As soon as I lost cell service my phone would never find a cell tower and showed ""No Service"". Even after turning Airplane mode on and off, and powering the device on and off. I have even tried resetting all network settings to no avail.Once I had my carrier, Verizon, reactivate my 5G enabled SIM card and it came back to life until I lost service again by simply travelling. Not Good Apple!"
"iPhone 12 mini","When the phone got to me and I opened the package, I was happy to see that it didn't have any scratches or scuffs on it - it was like new. The only downside is that the shipping took a while and USPS doesn't offer the best tracking information. All in all, a great transaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","98% Battery Health and no scratches quite worth the $400 price tag"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came in flawless, 100% battery capacity, and unlocked on the Total Freedom Wireless network. This same network uses other networks that run off of Verizon towers and I‚Äôm sure it would work with T-Mobile and AT&T as well. Phone also still has some Apple Care time left on it which is a huge plus! Would buy this phone again if I needed one!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is the high quality phone that I expected. Performing great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very pleased with my recent purchase . Phone in great shape and battery health was 100%!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very happy, our phone came in perfect condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","I mean it's a good at a good price. thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Like the face recognition, battery life!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is great for its price. Work perfectly and looks brand new. No scratches. Very pleased."
"iPhone 12 mini","at the beginning was a little scared because I've bought an iphone 5c renewed few years ago and it came with several dents but this one came in excellent condition really like new and battery 100% health, I'm really happy with this purchase"
"iPhone 12 mini","Can‚Äôt take photos bc I‚Äôm using it, however, I was reading reviews and it scared me to buy it. I trusted my gut and now I love it. It even comes with a SIM card piece so you can open the slot and USB lightning cord.No scratches, nothing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Batter life is limited vs Samsung. I bought it for the small size. FaceTime works well connecting with my patients. Expensive even though I bought refurbished."
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm very happy with this purchase. The phone is great, the battery health is 100%, face recognition works perfectly, no scratches. It's in perfect shape and condition. I would highly recommend it.At first, I was a bit hesitant because it was my first time buying a refurbished item, but it surpassed my expectations. Highly recommended!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect phone, no issues at all! I am on Straighttalk and just transferred my SD card. So happy with this phone and the money saved buying refurbished. Will definitely be buying this way in the future"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value and works as it should!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works fine. But if you buy the unlocked phone, it is NOT compatible with Verizon or straight talk. Don‚Äôt buy the unlocked version because it‚Äôs not really universally compatible. This is verified after speaking with Apple and Verizon while trying to switch carriers."
"iPhone 12 mini","I spent hours at my carrier trying to get this phone to work. As soon as I got it I brought it straight over ..having a business to run it was crucial. The thing could read a SIM card at all! Cartier told me it must have damaged antennasNever agsin!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone I have had for 14 days and it is trash the screen is not very real and today the screen has done the photo below no history of dropping the phone or sitting on it we were sitting in the car listening to music and this is what happened"
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived very late, maybe FedEx screwed up. Phone quality is good"
"iPhone 12 mini","My daughter is very happy with this iPhone! I came well packed and looks brand new!Would highly recommend this seller!Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Impecables"
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs so mini I forget it‚Äôs in my pocket . Had to get the otter box for the phone so I won‚Äôt drop it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Iphone12 mini arrived in condition as described. Locked for Verizon. So far...so good."
"iPhone 12 mini","I like that this phone has a lot of battery and also it charges so fast."
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost mint condition. No visible scratches on screen or back. Maybe minor wear on edges but nothing extreme. Would recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","nothing wrong works great, battery 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Love my phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I like it very much although there is still something unsatisfied."
"iPhone 12 mini","I needed to replace our outdated 6S+ phones. I picked the 12 Mini for price and size. We are very happy."
"iPhone 12 mini","It's newer and fresher is all I gotta say !"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phones came in pristine condition! Like brand new! Very, very pleased!"
"iPhone 12 mini","No le funciona el speaker"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was working good, suddenly got battery drained, turns off, asks to restore and when connected to the computer you get and error.Got a message that battery it‚Äôs not genuine so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the defective part.Returning the phone for refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was great. No cracks one small scratch that‚Äôs hardly noticeable. The only issue is the sim tray was missing?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Size and useability. Great iPhone features."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came quicker than delivery expected and was in good condition! Works great and much faster than XR"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great and excellent customer service! Thank you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","If you're worried this is not a real product or scam, it is not. It came in a plain white box with a random Motorola charging brick and no earbuds. However it had no scratches and was in perfect working conditions. This is a refurbished phone and is presented as such."
"iPhone 12 mini","Pretty significant scratch left on screen. Do not purchase expected unscathed screen. Battery capacity was at 100% which is a bonus."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is TRASH :( My 13 year old paid $450.00 that he saved up HIMSELF. It doesn't charge fully and says its overheating at normal temperatures. He literally has to put it in the fridge before he tries to charge it. And of course I would have to wrestle it from him in order to send it back because it's not broken like his old phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","La verdad muy buena inversi√≥n, el tel√©fono ten√≠a algunos ara√±azos pero nada importante mente grave, a simple vista son invisibles.El tel√©fono me encanto!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Within a week or so of using my phone, it began malfunctioning. It would be unresponsive, freeze, and even called 911 and my emergency contacts without prompting. When this happens I can‚Äôt even turn it off. All this has happened in the condition it arrived to me, as I haven‚Äôt dropped or wet it at all since opening it. Buyer beware. I have bought many refurbished electronics on Amazon with great results but not from this seller. It is eligible for return and I haven‚Äôt attempted to return it because I threw away the packaging and accessories so I cannot speak to their return service."
"iPhone 12 mini","the phone its 100% perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","The perfect, no nonsense phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was nothing less than amazing! My husband loves it! No visible cosmetic issues and it works like a charm, you can't tell it from new! Love the back tap screenshot/ gestures! Not to mention it arrived so fast! I was amazed and I have prime, but like it was here so quick!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurb iPhone 12 Mini is perfect. Looks brand new, works great.The only zonk I‚Äôd give it is battery life is down very slightly to 90%.Very pleased overall."
"iPhone 12 mini","This cell phone does not turn off at times. And I am scared to return it because my information and credit cards are stored in it. So I am unable to delete anything. Help"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was clean was lil skeptical but damn I like it a lot . When they mini it‚Äôs really small lol smaller then the iPhone 6 s or similar size but overall great buy an I would recommend. Fully unlock added my SIM card an that was it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks brand new and I‚Äôve had no problems with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was in very good physical shape. After a couple of days it lost activation with Verizon. Local rep tried other SIM card to no avail. Glad it came with good warranty.I wound up buying a new 12 mini."
"iPhone 12 mini","Costed nearly $200 less than a brand new iPhone. Had a few small scratches on the bottom of the screen but disappeared as soon as I put on a screen protector. Besides that looks like new. Battery health was also at 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","I had my white one going on 6 months with not a single issue and came with no damages also I have a straight talk sim card so it takes almost cell carrier"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered as promised in a timely manner and came in perfect shape physically. No visible scratches and worked beautifully for about a month. Then, the phone just randomly shut off and wouldn't charge. Nothing would show on the screen either when a charger was plugged in. Just nothing!I took it to a local independent repair shop and was informed that there were TWO shorts on the motherboard of the device. One on a capacitor for the charging portion and one for the touch screen. The repair technician said he's NEVER seen two shorts on a device like this before. This device was in great shape on the outside, but obviously had some issues on the inside. I'm not gonna say ""don't buy from this seller"" , but I will say , be aware that you are buying a refurbished phone and you never know what's going on the inside.Otherwise, this was a learning experience (again) for me and I'd like to share it with others!Thank you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Do not like this phone at all, it's difficult to turn it on and use all of its functions.It's too small and more sophisticated and complicated that I need.I purchased a newer Iphone and it is easier to use."
"iPhone 12 mini","The best quality phone upgrade"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nice screen for mobile gaming"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very badly miss labeled. It was listed as renewed through Amazon so you think you‚Äôre getting an excellent quality product. However the phone of course is great I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better phone, But again it was listed as renewed so you would think you‚Äôve got a great quality condition phone when I received it there was a deep scratch for the bottom of the display in numerous deep gouges in the top left corner of the display along with several tiny dents in the side bezel. I had to pay an extra $150 on top of this price to get the display replaced. So I only gave it 2 stars because the seller doesn‚Äôt know how to properly list what they have."
"iPhone 12 mini","The charging port doesn't charge phone reliably. One needs to wiggle the charging wires. If you are lucky, you may be able to start charging."
"iPhone 12 mini","To be honest I got this iPhone 12 mini by accident; I meant to get the standard iPhone 12 - but I decided to keep it as it's serving me well"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was excited about my purchase since I'd be receiving a phone in good condition for a great price. I open my package and notice the screen is already cracked! Is this part of the ""renewed"" condition? Sending back immediately"
"iPhone 12 mini","A phone for one handed use at last. Battery lasts all day. Light. Fits in any pocket. Super fast. Coming from an iPhone 7, this is a dream. Was a renewed phone but looked and operated brand new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Apple does it again with the IPhone 12 miniCute little phone with lots of powerGreat camera, tooI don‚Äôt foresee myself upgrading anytime soon after this."
"iPhone 12 mini","The product was in good shape, but did NOT accept my Cricket SIM card. The phone is supposed to be unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","I will say I had no scratches nowhere on this phone not on the screen the camera not even the phone had no scratches perfect condition. Thanks a lot love the phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone as an unlocked, refurbished phone. The phone settings said no sim restrictions, however it would not work with any sim card i put in it. I thought it was a problem with my service so I changed phone plans, and It still did not work. I ended up having to switch phone plans and getting an entirely new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am very happy with this purchase. I am actually about to order another one. Happy and satisfied with my purchase üòç"
"iPhone 12 mini","I receive the product in an unknown box that look nothing like an iPhone and when i put the phone in charge it overheated and when on video the phone gets hot."
"iPhone 12 mini","I moved from Android to iPhone mainly because I can't find an Android phone this small or smaller. After using it I switched back. I took 1 star off because I realized I hate iPhones and 1 star off because the screen came with some pretty noticeable scratches on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery health for this item was not satisfactory. When it arrived, the battery health was as low as %86."
"iPhone 12 mini","Like the title said... I purchased one in ""Excellent"" condition, but it came with sticky residue, clearly from where an old case had been, and there is a small crack on the top of the camera. The volume up button is sticky, this is not acceptable unless it had been marked down to at last ""Poor Condition"". There was also an app pre-installed about checking the features before selling. This all felt sloppy."
"iPhone 12 mini","The Cellphone arrived in perfect condition, all functional, without scratches."
"iPhone 12 mini","Red spot on screen every time I‚Äôm in selfie mode"
"iPhone 12 mini","Love it so far and great price for this phone, what a difference in operation from using my iPhone 8 that I had previously!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Obvious that the screen was replaced bubbles and bad touch recognition should of sprung for the new one. You get what you pay for."
"iPhone 12 mini","Slow to respond if it did respond; being the mini the keyboard is smaller"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived properly wrapped and looks brand new and battery health at 100%. 10/10"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone arrived in like new condition. No scratches and battery health at 100%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Obviously not every phone will be in 100% perfect condition, but this one is fin perfect condition with 100% battery capacity."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was looking forward but it arrived with zero charge, took hours and hours to charge, and battery depleted without even using the phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","iphone comes with scratches on the back which I do think it not quite fits into ""looks like new"" in the description. Decluttr (the third party seller) has its own store and the price here is even a little bit higher than the ""pristine"" level in decluttr's store."
"iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately had a time sensitive purchase that I can‚Äôt return in a timely way anymore. The screen is badly scratched up. The housing has chips, but a good case will cover that.The screen in the other hand is driving me crazy. How could they call that ‚Äúlike new‚Äù. They‚Äôre ripping off people and lying."
"iPhone 12 mini","Por favor exijo una explicaci√≥n. El Telefono venia con el boton de encendido completamente pegado o al hacer llamadas se escuchaba muy bajo (hice todo lo que encontr√© en foros y sitios especializados para tratar de subir el volumen de mi parlante y nada). Finalmente lo llev√© a una tienda Apple y me dicen que al ser ""reacondicionado"" al parecer cuando instalaron la pantalla qued√≥ pegamente en el boton de encendido y en la regilla del parlante para escuchar. El arreglo vale m√°s que el tel√©fono. POR FAVOR EXIJO UNA EXPLICACI√ìN PORQUE VENDER UN TELEFONO AS√ç ES UNA ESTAFA DERECHAMENTE!. Quedo atento"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone for my son and we did have some problems with it cyz it wasn't unlocked but were able to talk to them n get it fixed n HE LOVES IT N SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone looked good worked pretty good it's pretty good but had liquid in display when phone was off"
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 Phone was completely unusable. I bought a screen protector and everything. It was slow and restarted almost each time I opened an app. As it kept restarting, the home page began to look more and more ‚Äúerased‚Äù and my apps would just not come back. I don‚Äôt know what the heck was wrong with it, going to return it asap.

Edit: so I took it to AT&T and the phone was BLACKLISTED, so basically this shop SOLD ME A STOLEN PHONE. My whole AT&T account was on lock down, and the phone even corrupted my sim card. I didn‚Äôt know that can happen but if I put the sim in a new phone it would mess it up too."

"iPhone 12 mini","So, there is no longer a home button, and to take a screen shot requires you to set your phone so that a ""double tap"" takes a pic for you. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes it works when you don't want it to. As you'd guess, this results in many erroneous pics being snapped. Also, when scrolling on the bottom part of the screen, I end up with all kinds of strange things happening. That said, the battery life is great, but the new controls are terrible, making the iPhone even less worth the price. Once this one is done, I'll be moving over to Samsung."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looked like it was never touched"
"iPhone 12 mini","My item is very nice. Good as new. 100% bat and no scratches. Thankyou seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","Glad I got my iPhone but it took a while before I got it totally working with a new SIM card from AT&T."
"iPhone 12 mini","Stopped working days after warrantee ended-- denied any coverage or replacement."
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone came within a day, works fine, was flawless in appearance and fully unlocked as advertised. All I had to do was add a SIM."
"iPhone 12 mini","The metal is super scratched on all sides of the phone. I would hardly call this ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. The battery health was also at 83% on arrival. I‚Äôll be sending back for a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","Heck yes I came a few days early and I‚Äôve been using it since the minute I got it"
"iPhone 12 mini","It gets inedibly hot while charging, then the screen will dim to where you can barely even see it I guess to try to reduce overheating

the battery life is also pretty bad"
"iPhone 12 mini","other then that good purchase for price"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was going okay enough until I accidentally splashed water on it. The way this company ‚Äúrefurbishes‚Äù phones ruins the ingress protection so it is WAY more sensitive to water damage then it should be. NOT WORTH 400 dollars. Buy new or from a friend cause this company does nothing to ensure quality AND THEY RUIN THE WATER PROTECTION. A new phone has ip68 meaning it is water proof up to 1.5 meters underwater for 30 minutes. A light dip took this phone out. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very Bad touch screen not working properly even not start."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product was perfect cosmetically, haven‚Äôt had any problems."
"iPhone 12 mini","i like i phone its great"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo excelente me encanta üòª"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone would randomly restart and the touch screen stopped working. This is our 4th or 5th phone that we have purchased refurbished and the first three have worked out but the last two have not. We had to go out and just purchase a brand new iphone at our local phone company store."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good Phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good quality picture. Good prices. Smaller size than iPhone 6s but the screen size is bigger."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great overall product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost all videos that I film on this phone come out distorted and muffled. I regret buying this. My wife‚Äôs iPhone 8 is better"
"iPhone 12 mini","I had no issues I highly recommend this dude as a safe seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","Highly recommend. Saved hundreds for a like-new phone. Popped in my SIM card and worked seamlessly."
"iPhone 12 mini","Totally value for the money. Arrived early. Battery life rocks and I love the fave recognition feature. Love this one"
"iPhone 12 mini","Got a blue one, couldn‚Äôt find any scratches or imperfections on the phone. Highly recommend. Great price for unlocked"
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratches, 100% battery life, came with charger and block"
"iPhone 12 mini","I received an Unusable phone that did not comply with Amazon's renewed guarantee.... The battery service life on the iphone 12 mini that i purchased was below 72%, despite them being guaranteed to be more than 80% on the listing page when purchasing a phone. The phone dies from 100% to zero over the course of 4-5 hours when left completely alone. It appears to not have been ""renewed"" at all.

I have bought amazon renewed phones for the past 5 years, and have never had anything even remotely disappointing until now.... This phone was scratched and still dirty when I pulled it from its box."
"iPhone 12 mini","I don't use smartphones extensively, so, battery life 2 days, form factor perfect, very nice camera.
The best iPhone ever."
"iPhone 12 mini","Battery life seems to not as strong as new but its ok"
"iPhone 12 mini","I like that my battery last longer. It‚Äôs great for value cost of the phone. I like the face recognition it‚Äôs cool."
"iPhone 12 mini","todo bien"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was okay and I didn‚Äôt have to wait for a long time"
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm disapointed: Battery health / Maximum capacity at only 90 percent. I expected it to be 100 percent. Also the screen has 2 scratches on the screen; maybe from someones diamond ring?? Should I return this iPhone?"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came just as described, shipped quickly, and works great with my mobile service."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical of this because the lack of reviews but I was proven wrong! The phone came fast, in good packaging and works and looks perfect!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is locked."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Only had one very small blemish. Overall I‚Äôm very happy! Came with 100% battery life and in fantastic condition"
"iPhone 12 mini","The product looked fine, just some scratches but something is wrong with the sim card reader, it wouldnt let me use my data, or make phone calls."
"iPhone 12 mini","80% of battery condition"
"iPhone 12 mini","AllI is fine!! Like a new one"
"iPhone 12 mini","The picture doesn‚Äôt say many it was too small for her"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent value for what looks line a brand new phone. Came early and very happy about this purchase! Recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","We sent in an unlocked phone and it was as described but they stated they rejected it due to ""Carrier information on the device received does not match device selected when creating the trade-in order"". We never selected a carrier which was an option since it was unlocked. Trade in is a total scam to get you to purchase their product."
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this renew iphone for my younger sister. However, the iphone I received is really dirty (see photo). I have no idea why this iphone can even more dirty than my 6 year old back-up phone. I understand it is pre-owned iphone so it might have scratch and dent. However, a dirty iphone?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Extremely happy with what i got would purchase again in the future"
"iPhone 12 mini","the product was as advertised with little to no visble previous use. I would purchase again!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Cumple todas mis necesidades y me ha funcionado perfectamente."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, came in better condition then I expected, looks brand new I was highly impressed! Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Despite paying for the ""Excellent"" option I received what appears to have been marked as a ""Good"" and ""Fully Functional"". However, product had visible damage and the phone speaker was not functional. I was scammed. Just go to the store."
"iPhone 12 mini","You wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs used. It is like brand new. Great deal."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs look like new..worth it ..perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really enjoy my new iPhone. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect."
"iPhone 12 mini","i know it‚Äôs partially my fault that i didn‚Äôt read the sizing but it‚Äôs pretty small. and it would not recognize my face or anything. i returned it and it was basically a waste of money."
"iPhone 12 mini","The touch screen strays almost every time üòÖ"

"iPhone 12 mini","Great for the money, I hate payments!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Al dia siguiente que lo recib√≠ dej√≥ de funcionar el microfono, y la pantalla vino rayada.
Me salv√≥ Apple ya que le quedaba algo m√°s de un mes de garant√≠a y me cambiaron gran parte del equipo."
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 Mini was advertised as refurbished and fully functional, but it would not recognize my Verizon SIM card. I spent 3 hours between the Apple and Verizon store trouble-shooting, and eventually Apple decided it needed a full back unit replacement. Not sure when/if I will have a functioning phone anytime soon."
"iPhone 12 mini","I received the phone after one week it wouldn‚Äôt connect to Wi-Fi!! Took it in to my carrier, they tried, and wouldn‚Äôt it connect. I talked with Apple, bottom line, it would cost $493 to have Apple fix it. I sent it back."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone started to have issues about 2 weeks after purchasing. Would restart or screen would freeze. Took it to the Apple Genius Bar where the scanned the phone Id code. Came up that the phone had been to the apple store twice before with other owners. Employe stated that it has critical internal problems and it should be returned. I bet they will get the phone back and try to resell it as it has no scratches or damage.. Looks like it just came out of the box. Very deceptive."
"iPhone 12 mini","Battery good no problems here"

It doesn‚Äôt ring while getting a call most of of the time , half of the time the people on the other end say it‚Äôs real statically to hear me . I could go on and on with all that sucks with this phone . I am not happy at all with it . My old I phone 7 was much better"
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bien asta a hora"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nothing to add"
"iPhone 12 mini","It overheats after 10 minutes use. I use it for business and social media"

"iPhone 12 mini","Works good but from time to time it freezes the screen. I have to press the power button and unlock the phone, to make it work again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Really enjoying my iPhone 12 mini blue"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything work fine for the first week and the phone looks new but suddenly it shut off. Now it's in a reboot loop and cannot be reset without taking it to apple. I think somethings wrong with the battery they use. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
"iPhone 12 mini","Returned the phone because it was so small and my eyes are so old! It was easily returned and money refunded quickly."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone was in perfect cosmetic condition! The rear camera was damaged. When trying to use zoom feature, the phone vibrate and screen would show a distortioned output. IMEI number was blocked from visable wireless. They made me pay to return defective phone...
I would not do business with again!"

"iPhone 12 mini","I only got the charger and not the phone, this might of bee a mistake but really wasted my time here. When returning you have to pay a shipping fee"
"iPhone 12 mini","I paid extra to get an iPhone 12 instead of another iPhone 8‚Ä¶only to realize after getting it that it doesn‚Äôt do anything (at least not anything that really matters) that my old phone didn‚Äôt already do. I mean, if face recognition is really that important to you, then go for it. But I wish I could get my money back and the iPhone 8."
"iPhone 12 mini","Wasted a lot of time trying to fix this device because I was not sure if it was something on my end. If your not willing to take the chance of something like this happening, I would not recommend this device."

"iPhone 12 mini","The phone worked for two months and then my service wouldn‚Äôt work anymore, I went to my service provider and they said that the phone was a stolen phone and no longer can be used with any service provider."
"iPhone 12 mini","Because this phone is from Japan. The camera shutter sound can‚Äôt be turned off. Otherwise the phone is good but it would‚Äôve been nice to know before hand."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was working good but first of all there were scratches on the back and also the battery percentage decreased from 94% to 92% between a few days."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great, unfortunately you can‚Äôt turn it off‚Ä¶ at all, the sleep wake button is completely pushed in. The phone is unusable, absolutely ridiculous."
"iPhone 12 mini","The screen had chipped edges."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is bad reseller sending iphones that do not work."
"iPhone 12 mini","The Face Recognition Didn't Work and I returned the phone immediately. Would not buy ""refurbished"" or ""renewed"" again."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came damaged and without a SIM card tray then no SIM card would work with the phone regardless of the claim that it‚Äôs unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","External speaker does not work consistently and sometimes not at all. Microphone does not work majority of times during calls and video calls. Doesn‚Äôt matter of using speaker phone or traditional phone microphone. Haptics do not work either. Did update for iPhone 12 mini that was supposed to help speaker issues and it did not resolve the problem. Trouble shooted with Apple through their app and phone call and still did not have a resolution."
"iPhone 12 mini","Well, this was not ‚Äúlocked to‚Äù Verizon, the SIM was locked period. Verizon couldn‚Äôt reset the phone and now it‚Äôs basically a paper weight. WHAT A WASTE! Definitely returning this nonsense."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was in good condition. However, it was locked to Sprint, and there was an outstanding balance due to Sprint on the phone.

The only good thing I can say is that they did process a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","1. Phone battery had issues, get hot easily
2. SIM card was initially unstable and then cannot be used. Verizon staff just told me it doesn't work even it is unlocked..."
"iPhone 12 mini","Opened up the package and it didn‚Äôt turn on. Even after charging for hours it didn‚Äôt even show low battery on the screen or anything. Just black"
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone only lasted 7 months. The phone does stay charged and it keeps freezing. Save your money and buy a new phone!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","When the ICCID doesn‚Äôt appear in your Settings> General> About, it means the phone was previously hacked or jail broken. After spending hours trying to get a signal on the phone, I realized it was missing its SIM/ICCID value in the settings. I‚Äôm very disappointed that this up to snuff refurbished technology doesn‚Äôt go through actual software testing."
"iPhone 12 mini","Producto en muy buen estado"
"iPhone 12 mini","llega maltratados, varios rayones en todas partes, 86 por ciento de bateria, para 430 dolares que te venden el movil no vale la pena. perd√≠"
"iPhone 12 mini","Purchased 2 phones and they looked as good as new and was delivered quickly. However after 3 months and 2 days the back of the 2nd phone started to heat up to alarming levels often and would freeze when it does. Don‚Äôt know if this is a hardware or software issue.....yet, extremely frustrating and disappointing to say the least as the phone is basically unusable"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was a birthday gift for my wife. It was supposed to be unlocked, but it's not. We're trying to get it unlocked but may have to return it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was locked and would not hold a charge with provided cable or any other cable."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is quite disappointing, as one would think a refurbished phone would include a 100% battery health."
"iPhone 12 mini","Tried to get in touch with someone to explain the phone didn‚Äôt work never got anyone. Do not buy from this here"
"iPhone 12 mini","Not only the battery does not last , the speaker is SO LOW omg, the camera is not even half of what I expected...and the screen is most definitely NOT scratch resistant. So bummed out ... please don‚Äôt save a few bucks and end up with this garbage"
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iphone. Two days later without ny reason it just turned off, didn‚Äôt want to charge or turn on again. Now I have to pay more than 50 USD to get a fixed cuz I brought it to Bolivia, I would like to receive a refund immediately!,,!!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is over heating while on call in few minutes."
"iPhone 12 mini","phone had charging , battery problems and obvious signs of use did not look like new as I expected."
"iPhone 12 mini","A renewed item does not mean to be dirty and poorly cared for. The battery life is at 89% , the front speaker seems to be all muddy, thats still dirty no matter how i tried to clean It up"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty disappointed when I received a phone full of scratches on the screen and on the back."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was activation locked. I had to get a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","Called Verizon and brought to Verizon store. Both said phone not compatible. Buyer beware"
"iPhone 12 mini","The speakers are busted. Really bad product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Can‚Äôt believe seller tried to pass this off as like new.. I tried everything including clean re install after that it was worse! Feel bad for next person who buys a blue iPhone 12 mini from this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Mal producto debido a la poca bateria y mal sonido"
"iPhone 12 mini","To small .. ringer stopped working only had a couple months not worth the money"
"iPhone 12 mini","This was my first attempt to switch from Android to iPhone. The phone shut down 5 times before I even had it set up (it was fully charged). I knew I should have bought new. This mistake is definitely on me."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am returning it. I‚Äôm unable to get cell service for it because the ID is unable to be recognized by the service carrier. Maybe there was an issue with the first owner."
"iPhone 12 mini","It doesn't work"
"iPhone 12 mini","me salio da√±ado el iphone"

"iPhone 12 mini","I bought an iphone 12 mini last week and it did not came un any box, literally was packed in a small bag.
Secondly, screen colors were very warmth. Too yellow to be honest."
"iPhone 12 mini","Es desbloqueado pero no se puede configurar con cualquier compa√±√≠a solo con T mobile que es la peor se√±al y el tel√©fono no tiene devoluci√≥n pr√°cticamente se pierde el dinero"

"iPhone 12 mini","Phone gets hot randomly should have been ck'd out"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone went out after 3 months, would not charge or stay on, waiting on response from seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Premium does not mean the phone is in perfect shape as I know iPhones will be going down in the next three months I was under the impression that I was getting a brand new phone slightly used they put a screen protector on the screen so you can‚Äôt see the scuffs and scratches be aware of this do not except a premium device when it‚Äôs not premium fair good great whatever because I wanted an iPhone really bad and didn‚Äôt want to pay the price that it‚Äôs at now and don‚Äôt want to wait three months well I will probably be returning his phone or getting a screen protector so I don‚Äôt have to see The scratches on I already had a case for this phone because at one time I had bought an iPhone mini 12 same color as I got now I paid $800 for it and then I returned it realizing that the phone is not worth $800 what happened to people saying no There is once upon a thing called the Boston tea party we all know why that party was it was because the price was too high I don‚Äôt like being duped"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love ky new iPhone I Totally recommend yahh buy one for sure 5 stars"
"iPhone 12 mini","It doesn‚Äôt read my SIM card but it said it s was an unlocked carrier"
"iPhone 12 mini","Had to return as phone was not unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","It wasn't the same as it was described. So many scratch on it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Fake phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone back in March and used it up until September 17th when the phone started to malfunction and die rapidly due to the battery not being an apple product. The phone worked perfectly before this and had only a few cosmetic problems besides that it was a great phone. The apple store even with Apple Care+ won't fix the battery they merely gave me the option of attempting to remove the battery and replace it or replace the phone entirely as some other batteries are impossible to replace depending on the type of manufacturing. I recently contacted the seller so we will soon see if there are any further steps I can take to fix my phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","The glass of the iPhone came damage doesn‚Äôt turn on"
"iPhone 12 mini","Wifi stopped working after one day. Had to return it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is clean on the outside but defective in its operation"
"iPhone 12 mini","‚ÄúRenewed to look like new‚Äù , mine had scratches all over right side if screen. Just buy the new one."
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything worked but the phone call didn‚Äôt work"
"iPhone 12 mini","This model is overall a great phone. Easily pocketable and had zero complaints about it. Battery life is good for phone of its size and features.
Big issue is that after 18 months of owning it the battery stopped charging one day and only turn on for 2 minutes before restarting. The battery unknown and service required message would show up saying my battery part may not be genuine apple part and not recognized. Brought it to apple certified repair shop and they told me that on average they get two 12 minis a month with battery issues and that it was due to the battery on just the mini not being able to handle the rapid charging from usb c cables but has been resolved for the 13 mini. I was out of luck since it was past the limited warranty and did not get device insurance because I‚Äôve never had hardware issues on any of my electronics. The tech recommended I use the USB A cables for slower charging so the battery try can handle it.
Already had to upgrade to the 13pro out of necessity but would have kept 12mini at least until 16 line up."
"iPhone 12 mini","no megusto"
"iPhone 12 mini","Equipo da√±ado muy mala experiencia"
"iPhone 12 mini","Don‚Äôt buy this item!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It said unlocked but it is not unlocked. and the display screen stopped working"
"iPhone 12 mini","They changed the pieces and the battery is not good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno desbloqueado impecable !!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really had an odd feeling thinking of buying it, but now that I have it I‚Äôm completely astonished! I thought it was gonna have a lot of cracks or even a scratch but nothing. It really seems and looks new. I‚Äôve had it for 2 weeks now Everything runs perfect! I love my Iphone 12 mini 128GB!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Purchased this device renewed from Moot. Phone looked brand new and didn't have a scratch on it. Battery was likely replaced as it's at 100%. I'd highly recommend this phone and store. I use this phone as my secondary device for work and while it isn't my main content consumption device, it's fantastic for what I use it for."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","The generic charging cable doesn‚Äôt do the job. I had to buy a real one. Phone has been great. A little chip by camera, but not bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","I just ordered this phone in red on Oct.1....I was a bit nervous about if it would be a like the new one I viewed in the Verizon store a few weeks ago. But guess what? I could not tell it from new! I was pleasantly surprised and have been recommending Amazon Renewed to all my friends! It is working fine and is quite a nice upgrade from my Iphone SE (2018) The screen brightness and battery life so far is amazing. Yes, I wasn't able to stretch the payments over 2 years like at the Verizon store, but in the end I am saving money. Also with an unlocked phone, if I ever want to break up with Verizon, I can with no problem! This has so far proven to be a great choice!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone a week ago and it works like new! Came with no scratches or anything which was what I was worried about. It did not come in it‚Äôs original box but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me because I throw them out anyways. Well worth the money!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine and does what it should. The camera on the phone is terrible. I am guessing that is what was sacrificed making the small version. Everything is great."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. Usually my apple phones break within a a few months (I have 4 kids they tend to through hammers and break things) this phone doesn't even have a scratch on it. One of my kids threw it across, the room. It went through the washing machine/ dryer, and we left it on my cars roof it fell of and didn't even have a scratch on it. My daughter (7 years old tried smashing with a hammer. I love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very impressed with the iPhone 12 mini I received, works as it should and looks new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I returnd 3/7/22 but not yet got my refund this to small"
"iPhone 12 mini","OK this isn't really to do with renewed iphone, but my 12 mini had absolutely awful color calibration. Maybe just my unit but who knows. Way too warm. It can be somewhat fixed using ""Color Filters"" under accessibility in the options, but that's not really designed for that and still can't fix it properly.

Other than that the phone is good, I mean it's an iphone you just poke the icons and all that, you know how it works. For a so-called ""mini"" I wish it was a little more mini though."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone I phone 12 min is locked and it was supposed to be a unlocked phone every thing else is good but I need a unlocked phone or to unlocked this phone or a refund because I can‚Äôt even activate this phone no we‚Äôre"
"iPhone 12 mini","What a disappointment for Apple to release such a garbage phone.
Easily the slowest processor and most unusable phone I‚Äôve ever owned and I‚Äôve owned hundred dollar phones"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself looked great but when I turned it on it said IOS is unable to determine the device battery health. You couldn't tell if it was charging, It kept saying battery health at 0% and then kept shutting off and turning on. I didn't even bother to set it up. The message I got on my phone said this may be due to having an improperly installed battery or an unknown battery. Very disappointing after spending over $700."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone has a lot going for it, but sadly also an achilles heel. It has easily the worst battery life that I've ever experienced in a smart phone. It also charges slower than any phone I've ever owned, smartphone or other. It takes a ridiculous amount of time to charge even with a cable, but with MagSafe forget about it. You get a trickle of power that will take hours to fill your phone even in airplane mode. It's a shame because I love this phone but all it does is die."
"iPhone 12 mini","699$ it‚Äôs new in stor"
"iPhone 12 mini","Wont read my SIM card"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone quit working after having it for two weeks. I was able to get my money. But very disappointed."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was reluctant to switch to an iPhone from android phone, however it is slowing growing on me. Not wild about Apple app availability nor functioning. Still haven't got my old ringtones to transfer and the process to transfer data from Android does not go as smoothly as Apple claimed it would be so it has been a challenge to make the switch.
I find Apple's ringtones and notification tones pretty lame and don't catch my attention like what I was use to hearing so I am still working on that problem.
If you make a switch plan to spend some time to get it working to your specifications. For me, it is still a work in progress."
"iPhone 12 mini","For starters This is my second refurbished phone. I just retired my last one after three years with absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just wanted an up grade.
After doing some research I went with the I-Phone 12 mini. I Bought it here on Amazon.
The phone didn‚Äôt come in the original box which was expected. Not a big deal. The phone condition was 99% flawless. After receiving the phone I looked it over for defects. All I could find was a couple micro scratches on the screen. The micro scratches completely disappeared when I installed the screen protector. The battery life was 100%
This phone is exactly as described. It‚Äôs a great phone at a good discount.
If your like me. You have money but like good deals this is the phone for you.
I highly recommend this seller and would definitely buy from them again."
"iPhone 12 mini","this phone needs some getting used to, as my first smart phone. There are certain navigation paths that are not intuitive for me to get from one screen to the next. Often I just have to turn off the screen using right side button, and then poking screen to turn on to the home view to get to another app. maybe I'm just over looking something.... Excellent condition for an Amazon 'refurb'."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was so excited and nervous to get this phone. One because it‚Äôs refurbished and two because I didn‚Äôt know if there was anything wrong with it.

I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase. The phone came well packaged. It wasn‚Äôt flopping around freely in the box like a refurbished phone I got a year back.

It was basically like new. Came unlocked like I wanted. No major scratches, no dents, nothing. It looks brand new! The battery came at 100% capacity and I was shocked and so pleased to see.

I decided to get this phone because I needed a bigger screen (I upgraded from an iPhone se 2020) the screen isn‚Äôt much bigger so it was easy to adjust to the size.

If you‚Äôre nervous to get this phone, I say give it a shot. You never know if it‚Äôll be good or bad and customer service gets to you quickly!

Edit: I‚Äôve had this phone since may 11th of this year. I received it with 100% battery capacity. Now less than a month later I have 98% battery capacity. I understand this is a used phone and refurbished, but how could I possibly lose 2% battery capacity in less than 1 month? Even as a heavy user that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Like I said I used to have an iPhone se 2020 and the battery capacity didn‚Äôt drop that quickly in the months of me using the phone. So I‚Äôm confused on how this is remotely possible. Especially with the phone being stronger, faster, and much better battery life, along with the A14 Bionic chip. Admittedly, I‚Äôve used a fast charger on this phone a few times, which can be a major role in battery capacity going down time over time, however, I‚Äôve switched from using a fast charger to a normal 5w charger which chargers much slower and is better on slowing battery deterioration. But either way, it shouldn‚Äôt suck up the battery health this quickly."
"iPhone 12 mini","From iX to i12 mini
Reason i did not go for the 13, cannot disable the washed out over saturated skin tone HDR.. Most pics look like they have a sunburn, i don‚Äôt think so Tim..

i12 has a different image processing..
Easily disable not so ‚Äúsmart HDR‚Äù

Well why would i want to do that?
See posted picture quality with HDR off.. Almost as good as the iSight cams in iPhone X..

Everything else is the Same as any other phones from Apple (other than size and shape), it‚Äôs the software and apps they play with and restrict.."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. It is flawless, and came with 128 GB, not the 64 I ordered. Also, came with screen protector. I returned it because it was creating random texts!!! I thought it had been tampered with. As usual, Amazon refunded 1.5 months later, no questions asked. I bought a new SE at the Apple store. SAME PROBLEM! Random texts! Discovered one can change the screen sensitivity under Settings, Accessibility, Touch, Haptic Touch. You make it ""slow"" instead of ""fast."" I am sorry I returned it! A GREAT PHONE. Fabulous camera too."
"iPhone 12 mini","I don‚Äôt have a picture of just the phone but it came packaged well, in perfect condition. Already had glass screen protector on it, no bubbles or scratches. Put my SIM card right in it- no issues with unlocked status. Really a great purchase I‚Äôm very happy with the quality and size. Just about the size as iPhone 6s maybe a rice size smaller. I love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Buying this iPhone Amazon renewed worked out great! I was hesitant at first, but I am glad I did. Phone looks like new, battery health meter shows 100%, and aftermarket charger appears to be high quality. This purchase saved me $200+ compared to buying new and got pretty much the same new phone experience."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery rated 100%. No scratches or dings. The small size is handy, but I have to wear reading glasses to read the screen. I am happy with my purchase. I got the $15/mo wireless service. I count on wi-fi and won't use the phone much. I have a PC and a large iPad."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was for granddaughter for Christmas so no complaints from her"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was amazed at the condition of the iphone 12 mini I purchased. Not a scratch on it and works flawlessly. Battery life is pretty good. Lasts hours longer than my iPhone X. Would definitely purchase again. Much better price than purchasing new. Picture quality is awesome!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Yo this damn phone is the truth! I was skeptical about was I about to loose $400 bucks, but shawty needed a new phone asap! Yo, I was expecting my phone on Monday and it arrived Friday üòçü•∞üòò came with everything I needed, was working after an hour of updates and I had a lot of stuff on my SIM card. This damn phone was scratch-less and if it had a had scratch I must‚Äôve missed it lol üòÇ I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE! Thanks everyone xoxo"
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôve only had the phone for a couple of days. It was very easy to transfer data from my iPhone 8. No visible flaws on screen. Seems to be working perfectly."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am very pleased with this purchase it has met all expectations. It was really easy to set up from android and because I‚Äôm not a heavy phone user the battery life is not as bad as described. I can get through a work day and then I charge my phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I didnt expect that it would be a great value for a renewed iphone. Just a hairlike scratch at the back & thats it. Everything is perfect. Loved it and glad that i tried to purchase a renewed iphone. Worth it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The product came as described! No scrathes or phisical damage! Battery came 88%, the phone works great like new. I recommend it when i can i will buy again my upgrade! And the price super good i save at least 350$!"
"iPhone 12 mini","100 percent battery! I‚Äôm very happy about that. There was one small scratch on the phone. Almost like new! It did not come in an original box or with original charger in case you care about that. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and in the box with the extra accessories. It got here within a few days. It was unlocked as said and came with tool to get your old SIM card out and switch it over yourself. I‚Äôm pretty happy. Thanks!"
"iPhone 12 mini","So far I am happy with everything. I bought 124GB storage because I am home bound and need lots of apps to manage my life. Only time will tell if it meets my satisfaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","There are no scratches, and the battery health is at 100%. I've tested the phone for a few days now, and I'm completely satisfied"

"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, good battery and accessories, and not a blemish on it. For its age, however, I would have liked a better price."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is beautiful. The phone came faster than I thought it would. I have no complaints about the phone itself. My only issue is the charger doesn‚Äôt work. I contacted the seller and I hope they can replace it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I understand these are refurbished but they are not even close to being in new condition.. bunch of dents and scratches!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks practically brand new. No scratches at all and 100% battery health. Completely worth it over buying brand new. Mine came with the much slower usb a charger NOT a usb c as it reads in the description which is another $20+ Hence only 4/5 for the misleading description."
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing delivery! It came the next day.

"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm really impressed with the Amazon refurbished products. My phone is nearly perfect. One minor blemish on metal side of casing, hardly noticeable. I spent 5 minutes trying to find anything wrong with it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Got a great deal, device came in nearly perfect minus the tiniest ding on the perimeter of the phone, other than that you‚Äôd assume it was brand new! Even the battery health is 100%"

"iPhone 12 mini","Looks new 100 battery health"
"iPhone 12 mini","Took a gamble on this iPhone 12 mini as I usually buy new, but I didn‚Äôt want to drop that much $ on a new 256GB version of 2020 device, so I gave Amazon Renewed a chance. The phone arrived in generic box & looks brand new, not a scratch or scuff anywhere. I try to keep my brand new phones looking new with a case & tempered glass screen protector, but this looks as good as my recently purchased 13 mini. For the record, this wasn‚Äôt the cheapest seller option & this was one of those renewed devices that was fulfilled by Amazon instead of the seller - I don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference, but I would buy more devices if they came looking like this 12 mini. I‚Äôm very impressed. Everything works. It‚Äôs not sim locked, like my 13 mini, so I imagine it‚Äôs unlocked as described. Battery capacity health is at 100%"

"iPhone 12 mini","Even though there was a small glitch in the shipping, my phone arrived undamaged and in excellent working order. The condition was even better than I could have hoped for; it has the appearance of a brand-new phone. Their customer service is outstanding; working out the small shipping glitch and making it right with me. It is not often you find a company that is willing to go the extra mile for their customer, but they did and I would definitely use them again in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Acceptable quailty with reasonable price."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone had been delivered with good condition and not including original box, and accessories. The screen has a small scratch but not serious. All function is working good. The price is still high for refurbished iphone 12 in Amazon."
"iPhone 12 mini","Me encant√≥ esta compra, cero problemas con el tel√©fono."
"iPhone 12 mini","So far so good. No problems and the value for the money is good. Bought one from facebook and was cheated. Tried to more times and purchase did not go through. Amazon is a lot more secure"
"iPhone 12 mini","Received exactly what I paid for; all seems as described. The reseller did a great job, and I am glad I tried this route to save a bit of money."
"iPhone 12 mini","Maybe you should consider a new iPhone rather."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great battery, perfect size imo, good enough camera. I just wish it weren‚Äôt an iPhone."

"iPhone 12 mini","Purchased as a gift. I dont know how to use mac-anything, but trying to figure it out slowly during the setup process. Seems legit."
"iPhone 12 mini","I ordered this phone on tuesday and it was said to be delivered on saturday but it came today in good condition. Im honestly suprised that it came in new condition since it a very far way. Yes I am a real person I ordered this phone from Hybrid It. You should check them out!"

"iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"iPhone 12 mini","What's better than getting brand new looking phone . Paying half price . I wanted a mini so bad well adopt a phone made it affordable to do so.. and it's perfect looks brand new , works like it's brand new. Very impressed I e been telling everyone to order through them. Order with confidence thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone seems to be working ok. There‚Äôs just too many scratches, feels like the first owner never wore a cover in the iPhone. Also, the camera stabiliser has been noisy and apparently won‚Äôt let the camera focus properly. It‚Äôs such a shame cuz I really bought this phone because of the Camera, as I really like the quality in the pictures taken with an iPhone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go into the AT&T store again. This is the way to go. They make the iPhone transfer and set up dummy proof. Anyone can do it. And. Ow I have the flexibility to change carriers if I want. Looks exactly like a new phone from the store, you‚Äôd never know it wasn‚Äôt.I personally like the mini size so it can fit. Over in purses and pockets. It‚Äôs about the same size as my old iPhone 6s and plenty big enough to read from the screen."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very nice phone, received in condition as advertised."
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost new I just think the battery is quick to discharge"
"iPhone 12 mini","Screen is a little less touchy than id like but overall great phone great experience."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was worried when I placed the order, after reading some of the reviews. I thought I would most likely just return it when it arrived, but it looks brand new and even better, the maximum capacity of the battery is still 100%. They are 20 cheaper now than when I bought mine, but I am so thankful I purchased when I did and got the perfect one that I did."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very happy with phone. Works perfectly and has no cosmetic flaws. Awesome buy!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I wasn't sure to buy it, but I did it anyways. Just a little scratches on the screen but still looking good. The battery life is 100% so I'm so satisfy with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","Totally satisfied customer. Thank-you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Couple of marks on outside, battery life at 86% and does pretty fast but good for the price. Face recognition is great and touch screen has good response."
"iPhone 12 mini","My daughter loves this phone!! Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived in working condition, only the frame paint and back glass had rub away paint and smudge/scratch's. overall great phone works and does its intended features."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works fine. This refurbish item was in absolutely perfect condition. If I didn‚Äôt know it was a referral but I would‚Äôve thought it was brand new. The battery life is excellent. The gnu system and the gestures for this iPhone are very different from what I had previously been used to, but I‚Äôm getting used to it. The thing I like best about it is the is the battery life. I‚Äôve gotten 11 hours out of this thing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Firstly, this is the first iPhone I have ever purchased. Before this, I have always only used Samsung phones but I always was curious about the fuss of iPhones. Not only that, but I was desperately wanting a small phone again because a lot of Samsung phones are 6.5 in screens or bigger. That's what made me look into the iPhone 12 mini. I went ahead and bought one on Amazon since the price looked appealing and I should mention that I bought mine from a company called ""REXI"" for $699 with prime. It was on my doorstep in 2 days and when I opened it I was pleased to find the phone in New Condition just like it was specified to be. Even better was when I turned it on & checked the battery life, it turned out to have 100% so I knew I got a quality phone. I took a picture to show the battery life, btw.I‚Äôve only had the phone for a week but I was already compelled to give a review to let others know that if they decide to buy a Amazon renewed iPhone 12 mini then buy one from ‚ÄúREXI‚Äù because they sell quality phones.Also, I‚Äôve heard a lot of people complain about how long the battery lasts and I have to say, with regular use (ie, YouTube videos, internet, talk, text, etc) it lasts me about 12 hrs. I unplug my phone from the charger at 6 am cuz that‚Äôs when I wake up and I use it all day then usually have to charge again by 7 or 8 pm depending on how much I used it. And sometimes I can even get away with making it last a little longer. I think the battery is fine unless you like gaming a lot on your phone then you definitely will kill the battery fast, but for regular use, I think it lasts just fine. I‚Äôm really liking the iPhone 12 mini and after being a Samsung user for so long, I‚Äôve been getting used to how iPhones work differently. It‚Äôs a good phone and I think I‚Äôd definitely like to keep this one."
"iPhone 12 mini","battery came with about 87% so it still lasts most of the day, it was unlocked so i could choose my own carrier, overall a good purchase"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really like the size which fits better in my pocket and hand. I don't like the battery life. I guess because of the small size you need to charge it multiple times."
"iPhone 12 mini","Was concerned buying an expensive, renewed phone online (site unseen), but very happy with the purchase. Looks brand new. No scratches or dings. Nice aftermarket box (not apple box) with charger cable, power adapter, and sim card tool. Unlocked as described. No icloud, find my phone lock. Was especially concerned about the battery health but it's 100%. Shipped via FedEx. FaceID works fine.Set it up and did a migration from my old iphone 7 to this new phone. Inserted my sim card and was good to go.I looked at a lot of phones on ebay but decided to purchase on amazon, mainly because of their return policy. Price was about the same as online auction prices. Worried about getting a phone from ebay and it being icloud locked."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone seems fine, was in good condition but it was a gift so i have noidea how well it functions."
"iPhone 12 mini","Excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 12 mini","Just like new I love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Even has a screen protector installed perfectly. Face ID and the touch screen work flawlessly as well. 10/10 the price was unbeatable."

"iPhone 12 mini","Came days earlier than it was expected to and it was easy set up. No complaints at all"
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs a beautiful blue 12 mini and I‚Äôm thinking it was never used. 100 % battery potential even though renewed only guarantees 80. No scratches, not even minor, works perfectly. Cellular Resource sold it through Amazon Renewed and I couldn‚Äôt be happier."

"iPhone 12 mini","for the price, a very solid phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I use the phone every day for work, I love the picture quality and ease of use of the over all phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I see a lot of reviews about cracked,broken screens and back glass.It‚Äôs the price you pay for buying renewed,you take that risk.Bought an iPhone XR from Amazon,best phone ever renewed.Recently bought the iPhone 12 mini new from Apple and I love it plus I got Apple care for it.you all need to understand your buying a previously own iPhone and it‚Äôs not going to be perfect.If you want perfect buy directly from Apple"
"iPhone 12 mini","What this is not a new phone you could fool me by missing the original box and the replacement cord work fine. The screen size is the same as my 8plus I am very please with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","The father of my child loves it he said it was a great buy the battery life was even good for a renewed phone (89%) face recognition is great and same with the screen he‚Äôs very happy with the purchase he made for this item"
"iPhone 12 mini","Renewed or not, it looks sick but I‚Äôll update the post after using it for a while"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone fits in the middle of your hand. Really small for someone with large hands."
"iPhone 12 mini","I got exactly what I wanted I turned on the phone set it up and it‚Äôs unlocked and all functions work it‚Äôs as advertised"
"iPhone 12 mini","Easy to set up, for refurbished phone , excellent condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product is not what I expected. I am disappointed."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good as new, with 100% battery and like 2 very tiny scratch on the top of the screen, which obviously doesnt bother me (not a single scratch anywhere else). Great purchase and was surprised by the condition, its basically brand new. Also the reason i said to contact the seller, was because I purchased the same item from a different seller and got the korean version (which i returned since the shutter noise was mandatory), so I bought it from a new seller (forefront solution) and asked them if the phone was a US version to avoid another refund fiasco. As such, this time around it was a perfect experience since the phone was indeed a US version. So please check out the different sellers before making a purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","We have had this phone for several months and it‚Äôs been great! No problems and shipped quick. Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought this for our son. His first smart phone. Looks brand new. These don't come in original packaging, but came with a wall adapter, lightning cable and phone. Pleased. Unlocked, pretty easy setup, and easy to add to no-contract cell service provider. Works fine. Recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product is not what I expected. I am disappointed."

"iPhone 12 mini","Great device condition.No scratches as they said.100% battery life.1 Year warranty.61 days of Apple care+ coverage.Would love to trade this and shop for my next phone from this seller in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Why is there no Pre-paid postage given for defective iPhone with a large scratch on the glass?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien algunos detalles m√≠nimos nada m√°s hubiera deseado que tuviera un poco m√°s de la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a de ah√≠ en fuera bien."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 A black spot on screen that wasn't communicated, but the fact that im still on limited warranty could compensate but if im charged to pay the screen im returning the package."
"iPhone 12 mini"," A black spot on screen that wasn't communicated, but the fact that im still on limited warranty could compensate but if im charged to pay the screen im returning the package."
"iPhone 12 mini","Contras:
El iPhone lleg√≥ con caja gen√©rica y accesorios gen√©ricos (lo cual descrito en la publicaci√≥n).
Una bater√≠a con vida de 81% (como lo descrito en la publicaci√≥n, pero la bater√≠a si se siente vieja)
Detalles de uso en los laterales, es iPhone est√° desgastado y hasta despintado en algunas zonas en especial de los botones por uso; no esperaba un dise√±o impecable pero en el lente de la c√°mara se aprecia como si se hubiera ca√≠do y la parte de la pintura ya est√° maltratada y con rebana del golpe (en el borde del lente).
Lo peor: Al colocar mi SIM no agarr√≥ la red ni de AT&T ni de Telcel , siempre se quedaba en ""red no disponible"" por esta raz√≥n fue por la que opt√© devolverlo.
Adem√°s al momento de insertar mi SIM en la secci√≥n de detalles, no se mostraba mi n√∫mero telef√≥nico sino otro completamente diferente, lo cual me hizo pensar que el anterior due√±o o us√≥ un SIM digital (eSIM) o sigue anclado a ese n√∫mero, este fue otro red flag para devolverlo.
En la caja viene una nota de los pasos para regresarlo, borrar configuraciones y tu cuenta lo cual me hizo pensar que este proveedor tiene muchas devoluciones de producto.

Pros:
La pantalla est√° perfecta, m√≠nimos detalles case imperceptibles.
El tel√©fono en si es muy bueno, es r√°pido (para el a√±o en que estamos 2022) y bonito, pero si se siente algo fr√°gil sobre todo en la parte trasera que es de cristal necesitar√≠a cuidarlo con exceso para conservarlo en buena condici√≥n.

En resumen es un volado comprar reinfurbished te puede tocar uno excelente con 90% o m√°s de bater√≠a o como en mi caso uno con 81% ya dando las √∫ltimas, con detalles que si le a√±aden peros"
"iPhone 12 mini","100% battery life, no scratches, even an apple official power brick! Super happy with my purchase!"
"iPhone 12 mini","After reading some reviews, I was prepared to receive a phone that is potentially not very clean or poorly packaged. But the product I received was so good that I didn't even need to wipe it over the phone. There was only a tiny scratch on the side that was almost undetectable. Battery health is up to 85%. I am very happy to get such a good phone at such a great discount!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Vraiment facile √† configurer et √† effectuer le transfert des donn√©es √† partir de l‚Äôancien cellulaire. Tr√®s convivial. La pile √©tait presque √† sa pleine charge et l‚Äô√©tat de la batterie capacit√© maximale est √† 91%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Still learning. It's different than Android"
"iPhone 12 mini","En est√©tica est√° impecable, no tienen ni un ray√≥n sobre el marco y la pantalla en general est√° bien.
En bater√≠a llego con un 81% pero a√∫n as√≠ aguanta todo el d√≠a la bater√≠a. Venia incluida una mica de cristal ya instalada"
"iPhone 12 mini","funciona como nuevo, solo por unos peque√±os rayones en la pantalla el tel√©fono parece nuevo (es de esperarse por ser un equipo reacondicionado)"
"iPhone 12 mini","Producto en casi perfecto estado, lleg√≥ solo con una libera muy ligera en la parte de los costados, excelente funcionamiento y relaci√≥n calidad precio, recomendado"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ok. So I had my doubts buying a used iPhone 12 Mini (Renewed). But the result was definitely not what I had expected. The unit I ended up receiving was in basically new condition. Did some hardware tests to check everything out and all was good. Battery capacity basically unused at 100%. Overall? Pretty satisfied with this purchase! Great experience! (Although your mileage may vary) Thank you."

"iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto. Lleg√≥ en buen estado. Realmente vale la pena comprar productos renovados"
"iPhone 12 mini","Information says battery life minimum 80% but it won‚Äôt charge full and does not hold charge. A lot of chips on paint. I would expect something better for 3/4 of price of new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product is exactly as advertised, phone looks like new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Advertised as ""Fully Unlocked"" but it is NOT. I am not able to use the phone properly and I cannot find a contact seller option. Took phone to Telus retail store and paid $$ to see if they could fix the problem but they were not able to either."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value for money."
"iPhone 12 mini","Dej√≥ de encender al segundo d√≠a y lleva dos meses la devoluci√≥n y ni siquiera ha llegado a su destino, siguen sin reembolsarnos y todav√≠a nos cobran los plazos"

"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Everything works great on it looks new to me. 100% battery health no scratches, working charger"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Estaba tan emocionada de recibir el iPhone y cuando lo abr√≠ la verdad me decepcione un poco por qu√© no ven√≠a en su caja original era s√≥lo blanca y por la cantidad que se paga uno espera que venga con todos los accesorios, tambi√©n mandaron un cargador ese es punto a su favor!
El celular ven√≠a sin rayones la pantalla muy bien me encanto, lo malo en la parte de las c√°maras ven√≠a un poco sucio tra√≠a como polvo lo limpi√© y quedo perfecto!. Pens√© en regresarlo pero la verdad me encanto y el celular funciona muy bien.
Yo creo que comprar el linea lleva sus riesgos de que te lleguen las cosas mal, tal vez sea mejor comprar en la tienda apple. Le di 3 estrellas por que me llego un poco sucio y sin la caja original fuera de eso el cel estaba perfecto!.
A los que venden el producto por favor l√≠mpienlos antes de mandarlos!! Pagamos mucho y esperamos recibir todo bien.
Gracias!üòä"

This is just another example of a Millie mouse garbage that Apple insist upon shoving down peoples throat, they don‚Äôt care about quality, all they care about is spying on you and selling you polished junk, they lie about basically everything with the capabilities of these devices, this company needs to be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, do you hear that Mr. Cook!!."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Way too expensive to be renewed. Why pay 500 more for a used item and I can get it brand new and save $500. This item needs to be removed."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","You can buy this phone with 1TB memory BRAND NEW from your service provider or Apple for $200 cheaper. Don‚Äôt buy this. Way way overpriced, especially for a used/ renewed phone."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Toooo high prpice if i have this money i can buya new phone at apple why will i want to buy this phone? Thats renewedÔºü"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","You could buy a new one at Apple Store for 1,099.00 and NEW"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","These are renewed items which means they aren‚Äôt even brand new yet cost more than the iPhones that are brand new at apple. Disgusting and fraudulent."

"iPhone 13 Pro","Wow like a brand new phone! Thank you! But‚Ä¶ always do a master reset and go in to Apple ID setting and change name of phone. Mine still had previous owners name."

"iPhone 13 Pro","I was a little nervous about ordering a refurbished phone, but the one I received was in perfect condition and runs as a new phone. As my last phone was an 8Pro, it takes a little while to get used to the new features. But once you do, it is pleasure to use."

"iPhone 13 Pro","It came exactly as advertised, the battery health was at 100 percent and everything came working perfectly, the only thing it didn't come with was the original box. But the company even included the power brick (which apple doesn't even include) as well as the original charging cable. It shipped very fast and I have nothing negative to say about it :)"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excellent description by seller"
"iPhone 13 Pro","perfect phone works great"

"iPhone 13 Pro"," No happy"
"iPhone 13 Pro","It worked fine sans a small problem with the screen, but the problem was fixed promptly."
"iPhone 13 Pro","I like so much"
"iPhone 13 Pro","iPhone 13 Pro kept restarting after trying to do the initial set up. Tried backing up on MacBook and was not successful. Took it in to Apple store to see if they could do anything. Guy was honest and told me to just return, there was a history of issues with the phone I had."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Absolutely wonderful"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Beforee ordering I read good reviews. i read one review about the phone being locked. The one i received is locked due to it being on an installment plan with AT&T and it cannot be unlocked. I recommend for the price you just order a new phone."
"iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered a carrier locked phone (tmobile) but the phone didn‚Äôt recognize my SIM or an eSIM. Even went to tmobile store and they said it was because the phone was locked to a different carrier than mine. They said it seemed to be an AT&T phone but couldn‚Äôt verify. Was such a huge headache."
"iPhone 13 Pro","It would not let me select united states when the phone first starts up like it would just be glitch out on United States. Super disappointed. Just going to order straight from apple now on."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Phone doesn‚Äôt come in original box or original accessories better get new one"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The battery isn‚Äôt good"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The price for a ""renewed"" iphone is ridiculous. Why pay more at Amazon, when you can get a brand new phone from Apple, and with manufacture warranty?. It just makes no sense"

"iPhone 13 Pro","I couldn't have asked for more. The phone came in perfect condition with no physical signs of use/wear. The phone came at 100% battery health. And on top of that, there was the Amazon renewed store policies to act as a net.

Chefs kiss! :)"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered from the seller, HQTRsomething
The phone was in mint condition, 100% battery, and booted up with the initial setup. I put a sim in and works perfectly. Gotcha gods on my side. My only complaint is the shotty packaging since it was just bubble wrapped and the charger and cable were thrown into the USPS box, none of that amazon renewed box with sim card remover you see on youtube. The end justifies the means so I guess so Im not mad."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Came as described. Very good condition, basically like new. Battery health as at 100%"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Por primera vez compro algo usado y no puedo creer que el celular que me llego sea usado, porque para mi esta NUEVO, no pude haber tomado la mejor decisi√≥n. Al principio estaba nerviosa porque le√≠a comentarios de otros clientes que no les hab√≠a llegado el producto o que no estaban contentos con lo que le hab√≠a llegado, pero me arriesgue a comprarlo y de verdad que no tengo ninguna queja alguna. Cabe destacar que compre el celular en la condici√≥n de re-acondicionado excelente. El celular no vino con ning√∫n detalle, ning√∫n rasgu√±o. VINO ENTERO PERFECTO, con bater√≠a del 100%. Tambi√©n en una oportunidad hable directamente con el vendedor y me aclaro ciertas dudas, la persona fue amable y responsable. Muy agradecida"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Apple Iphone13 is the WORST product they ever made.
The texting/writing keyboard is a NIGHTMARE with mistakes. Constantly changes your spelling of words to other words.
BREAKDOWNS CONSTANTLY!!!!! You'll spend more time getting the damn thing repaired.
DO NOT BUY!!!! Probably better off with a 12? Or wait for new 14?"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Really looks brand new, love it"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente compra"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The product is great!"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente vendedor y excelente producto cumpli√≥ con mis expectativas"
"iPhone 13 Pro","If you‚Äôve had an iPhone, you know what you‚Äôre getting. It‚Äôs more of the same in terms of operating the OS, but in the best way possible. Everything works just as expected and is right where you think it‚Äôs gonna be.
As far as my refurb goes, the thing looks in perfect condition. The Apple listed battery health is also at 100% so I‚Äôm quite happy with that. I will say that I had to plug the iPhone into my computer and do a factory reset and update in order to get it to work (the iPhone wouldn‚Äôt get past the ‚Äúselect a language‚Äù screen when I first turned it on). No noticeable scratches or blemishes. I will update if any problems arise but I don‚Äôt expect them to at this point.
Oh! One thing I forgot is they actually gave me the official Apple 30w charging brick and a cable, which I think is better than the new iPhones cause they don‚Äôt even come with a brick anymore. So that‚Äôs some decent savings there!"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I use my phone for about everything and it works great. Love it"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Husband loved his phone."

"iPhone 13 Pro","Perfecto, literal es un producto nuevo"
"iPhone 13 Pro","La verdad ten√≠a mis dudas al comprar sin ser un producto enviado por Amazon, a pesar de que se venda por la plataforma, en este caso el proveedor fue Big Box Mexico (vendido y enviado por ellos) sin embargo al recibir el equipo wow, sin palabras parece nuevo tal cual.

- No le encontr√© ning√∫n solo rasgu√±o.
- Algunos proveedores lo mandan con mica para tapar rayones, este no tenia mica alguna y a pesar de eso no tra√≠a ni un m√≠nimo ray√≥n.
- Bater√≠a al 100%.
- Con garant√≠a de Apple hasta Marzo del 2023.

Fue sin duda una EXCELENTE compra, recomendado el vendedor al 100% de momento, cualquier situaci√≥n despu√©s si surge algo les mantendr√© actualizados."

"iPhone 13","The phone didn‚Äôt come with the SIM card removal tool, but it‚Äôs nothing a paperclip couldn‚Äôt fix."
"iPhone 13","Great condition works perfectly fine battery life 97%"
"iPhone 13","Frankly, I don't care enough to return the phone and I already put a screen protector on, but yeah there is some minor cosmetic damage such as; scratches on the back and the front, as well as some minor damage on the bottom right corner of the edge where it was probably dropped in the past. It doesn't affect the way the phone functions but is really more of a heads-up to whoever is thinking about purchasing from this seller"
"iPhone 13","Un equipo totalmente vers√°til, de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n del vendedor, funciona totalmente de maravilla"
"iPhone 13","Came with a charger, and a back that plugs into the wall. Came with 100% battery life and doesn‚Äôt skip at all, works like a brand new iPhone. I love how it has 128 GB because my old phone only had 64. No scratches, no cracks, and was very well protected in the box. It was easy to transfer my old phone data on to here. I also love the color, (I got pink)"
"iPhone 13","Excellent phone"

"iPhone 13","You really would‚Äôve thought I received a brand new phone ! The only thing that was different was the off brand charger that came with it. Other than that, no scratches , no mechanical issues, and battery life is at 100%!"
"iPhone 13","It came scratched but it‚Äôs alright"
"iPhone 13","This is my First experience with an iPhone I had a 13 mini and I just couldn‚Äôt handle the smallness of it so I sent it back and got the 13 and I really like the size of it it fits my hand good.. really in love with this phone! Technology can s amazing!"
"iPhone 13","Lots to learn with a new phone but I love it"
"iPhone 13","one of the most expensive and best products i‚Äôve bought on amazon! this phone is basically brand new! the battery capacity is 100% and i have yet to discover any problems with this phone! worth the price, 10/10"
"iPhone 13","Me gusto lleno todas mis expectativas recomendado 100%"
"iPhone 13","Too many noticeable scratches and paint chips to consider the phone in ‚Äúexcellent condition‚Äù. Upon trying to charge the phone, it had difficulties detecting the charger. Not sure if this was due to the phone or the other person on the line, but when calling someone they couldn‚Äôt hear me clearly either. Did not come in the original iPhone box and did not come with any original iPhone power adapter or cables. For the amount paid and the condition stated, I expected better. Not terrible, just not great."
"iPhone 13","Easy to set up"
"iPhone 13","Bought it because I cracked my Samsung s21 I‚Äôve used apple products before but this exceeded my expectations. The back is slippery so might want to slap a case on it and battery life (depending on usage) can easily last me a full day might need to turn on power saved mode and decrease screen brightness near the end of the day but you won‚Äôt need to worry about it dying on you real quickly"
"iPhone 13","These phones are like brand new... Glad I made the purchase..."
"iPhone 13","Excelente tengo una semana de haberlo recibido y me lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones un par de rayones milim√©tricos pero muy muy dif√≠cil de detectar a simple vista.Lo √∫nico que criticar√≠a son los controles de calidad, debido que en la galer√≠a ven√≠an fotos del due√±o anterior, las borr√© y ya!"
"iPhone 13","I upgraded from an iPhone 5 and wow what a difference. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the money for a new phone so I went with this one, it didn‚Äôt have an Apple box but I don‚Äôt care about that. I received a phone that was in pristine shape no scratches, nics, or dents. It looked brand new and in fact still has Apples warranty until March. I did go ahead and get the insurance for the phone along with a screen saver and case all in all I would defiantly buy from here again."

Great product and great seller."
"iPhone 13","The phone is in great condition and it works very well. Would recommend."
"iPhone 13","I had the IPhone 11 for two years and it was starting to die on me battery wise. So I took a leap of faith and got the 13 on Amazon for about a hundred dollars cheaper than buying it in store. It came perfect. Charger and all, no scratches or anything. I have had no issues in the 6 months I‚Äôve had it."
"iPhone 13","This phone came in MINT condition. No scratches whatsoever. What‚Äôs even better is that the battery health was 99%! I‚Äôm 100% Happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 13","I wanted to wait for a bit before putting my review and I am honestly impressed. This was my first iphone and I don't regret this buy. The phone came and was really nice had a couple scuffs but nothing a quick wipe with a cloth couldn't handle. It works really well and had 100 percent battery compasity. Overall this is something I would recommend."
"iPhone 13","Everything came out perfectly just one little scratch on the right top corner but it‚Äôs barely visible overall the phone works and battery/camera is definitely worth the upgrade coming from an iPhone 8 plus.

I didn‚Äôt like how it did not have a iPhone box."
"iPhone 13","Bater√≠a 100%"
"iPhone 13","Muy buena inversi√≥n."
"iPhone 13","Everything"
"iPhone 13","Definitely a nice phone love the quality"
"iPhone 13","iPhone 13 (unlocked) came in pretty quickly - can't say shipping speed was an issue. However, what I can say is an issue follows.

On taking the phone out of the box and starting it up, everything went well. Past this point, and well, it went downhill. I took my sim and placed it in the phone prior to setting it up and was met with constant ""searching for signal"". I tried multiple times to reset the phone, take out sim, even tried an esim with my carrier to no avail. After realizing my carrier was unable to assist me (and there was no support option with the seller listed), I went directly to Apple. Apple informed me the phone I had purchased had a failing cellular base band. The product details state the following ""This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple."". I understand it may not be certified by Apple, however, if this product was ""professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors"", why then did I receive a product which does not work. If Apple support identifies any other issues, I will be returning the phone and I will be expecting a full refund as the product sold does not satisfy their following statement ""The product is refurbished, fully functional, and in excellent condition. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.""

Also, as an FYI, the unlocked phone I purchased was initially set up for a carrier and was later unlocked to allow all carriers.

Buyers beware.

*will update review based on Apple's response to my warranty repair request*

UPDATE - Apple completed a warranty repair on the phone and it is working as intended. The phone did come with a limited warranty which covered the repair."
"iPhone 13","Daughter needed a new phone"
"iPhone 13","This product was practically brand new. No scratches. Came in a secure box. Electrical plug with USB was included. Takes excellent photos. Battery lasts a long time. I‚Äôm happy I only paid half the price of a new one."

It came exactly how it was advertised.... Would highly recommend."
"iPhone 13","So, I Upgraded From The 6s Plus To This Phone & It Is Awesome. I Had Bought A Renewed 11 Pro Max But The Battery Health Was 87%. I Was Hesitant To Get This Phone Because I Didn‚Äôt Know What The Battery Health Would Be But It Is 100%! This Phone Is Dope! I Love It!!! If You‚Äôre Thinking About Getting It, I Recommend It! üòÅ"

She says it‚Äôs so much smarter than her old phone (her old phone was a iphone 11) Her old phone used to glitch and mess up while on the charger. She told me her new phone (iphone 13) is working way better."
"iPhone 13","They gave me a broken phone then did not refund me all of my money because it was broken. Please just go to the apple store and buy one it is only $10 more. These people sell refurbished phones without completely verifying the parts to make sure that it‚Äôs useable.

2 weeks after having this phone it shut down on me. I immediately requested for a refund but was instead given a message saying ‚Äútry resetting the phone‚Äù. I took it to the apple store, had it reset and restored multiple times but the phone would still continue to shut off completely at random. It got to the point where it stayed off and would not turn back on. Apple estimated $356 for repairs and saw that the phone already had a history of being taken into the Apple store for the SAME PROBLEM. Other customers of Maverick Wireless had purchased this phone and had to return it for the same reasons, yet they continue to distribute this phone to customers and not providing a full refund.

Not only did I waste hours of my time trying to fix a phone that this company will simply resell as is again, but I lost $400 due to ‚Äúdamages‚Äù I did not cause.

I UNDERSTAND IT‚ÄôS CONVENIENT BUT THE RISK IS NOT WORTH IT :(
I never write reviews especially bad ones but as a young adult in college, wasted money is just heartbreaking."

"iPhone 13","I bought this iPhone 13 for my wife and it supposed to be in an excellent condition because that's what I paid for but instead when the phone arrived, the body of the phone were bented back and curving. It doesn't feel good when holding and it won't fit in the case as good because the body of the phone was not even or flat but bent."
"iPhone 13","Love it"

"iPhone 13","Es una l√°stima que no pueda usar el celular ya que el anuncio dec√≠a que era completamente desbloqueado y cuando lleg√≥ a mi pa√≠s, la tarjeta SIM no funciona con el iPhone.Anteriormente compr√© otros celulares de Amazon y nunca tuve ese problema, pero esta vez fue muy inconveniente ya me encuentro en el extranjero y es complicado encontrar una soluci√≥n estando lejos del vendedor"
"iPhone 13","I purchased the phone for my son and the description says excellent condition. I was very hesitant in purchasing the phone but I took a chance and boy was I disappointed. I will be returning right away for my refund."
"iPhone 13","The iPhone is really cool so pretty,but has a problem whit the battery,I put the iPhone to charger all night and still half battery.and work so slow other wise is good,the bad thing it is that is too expensive and a poor quality."
"iPhone 13","Worst phone experience ever. There is zero customer service if you beed to switch carriers via Amazon. Nobody will help. I switched carriers from tmobile to ATT and nobody can unlock this phone because it says its with sprint. I bought this as a tmobile phone. Dont buy phones on Amazon. Horrible nightmare of an experience. Never again"
"iPhone 13","Got the phone back in September, no issues. Then in October the Signal drops and never returns. After some investigation, the phone was reported stolen & blacklisted. Working on the return as I type. Very upset about this purchase."
"iPhone 13","I went to two different places to get the phone activated and was told that the sim was locked and that they couldn't activated that phone."
"iPhone 13","The seller charged me for restocking fee which is 20% of what I paid for. I received a defective and scratched phone that‚Äôs the reason why I returned it."
"iPhone 13","The battery life can be rated at 5%. The phone received is not worth the money paid. I will like to return the phone please"
"iPhone 13","I bought it for my girlfriend and the box contains no information. No Imei number"

"iPhone 13","The phone doesn‚Äôt seem to be properly rehabbed. The battery sucks, it‚Äôs brand new and doesn‚Äôt hold a charge all day and I‚Äôm not using it constantly, it‚Äôs either an inferior battery or it wasn‚Äôt replaced. Not at all satisfied with the Amazon rebuild. I don‚Äôt recommend it."
"iPhone 13","Q es robado"
"iPhone 13","This product looked brand new. It was easy to transfer my services. The phone would not stay on. When ever I use facial ID or put my pin in it tried to shut down. I used it for one day before going back to my old device and sent it back!"
"iPhone 13","The phone was not compatible with Boost Mobile's 5G Network and it arrived with scratches on the top right corner and bottom left corner of the screen."
"iPhone 13","I love using the phone it has some good things about it. I love making videos for people to look at or watch. Has problems working at times and like hard time when I am on call to hear me when I Face-Time. Also, it‚Äôs not that bad but, recommend Android Phone instead of an iPhone because it has some better quality. I think the iPhone 13 is a good choice to have as a phone. The good qualities that go good with the phone is that it is good for taking a picture of things. I love to use the phone because you can play games that you want and be talking, texting also doing other things on your phone as to having any other phone. Some of the other phones are different but, I think this would be the best choice for you to have. The phone is the best thing to order things also it is fun to be watching videos and other things. You will love it but, also have some bad things about it that you won‚Äôt like about it."
"iPhone 13","Couldn't set up phone due to internals damaged. No help offered had to do it on my own. Brought back to manufacturer and they honored factory warranty luckily."
"iPhone 13","The media could not be loaded.
 This phone was cleannnnn. No scratches, battery life 100%, excellent condition no sign of a previous owner. One thing though, when on a call and I remove phone from my ear to use it, the screen wont turn on for use."

"iPhone 13","Pretty color and true to description"
"iPhone 13","I have used android, iPhone, and crypto phones for the last several years, I would like to say that iPhones and in particular the iPhone 13 are radically behind in every category.

usability on this phone is dreadful, it's not easy to use with one or two hands, the Apple keyboard is ridiculously stupid when compared to an android. It's clumsy, it's too small, the auto correct feature Apple has doesn't work.

on a Google device if you slide, THE, Google learns that you mean THE, and you teach it how you type or how you speak. Apple devices it seems like the purposefully correct too a sixth grade level.

On an android I didn't have to worry about speech rate, or enunciating, because it learned. iPhones and Apple products don't, they stay stupid. There is no adaptation making communication very slow, cumbersome, like you're dealing with a child.

The OS, on an iPhone it's an open book. Are used two FA, crypto keys, pins and passwords and an iPhone and Apple product is very literally a hackers wet dream. You can't keep them out, and have to find third-party security in order to be minimally safe in this world.

Service and reliability, iPhone has to connect to Wi-Fi for everything, the OS is so slow operating only on cellular data. Any other phone on the market Wi-Fi is a secondary option, for iPhone it's mandatory for basic features.

Even with a Wi-Fi connection the OS on an iPhone is comparable to running DOS 3.0, it's slower than dirt, a snail going uphill in a heat storm is faster. YouTube barely loads, tick-tock barely operates, lag is ridiculous and incredible.

now when brought to Apple engineers, they said this was normal. That my phones, I tried multiple, that's just how Apple's operate.

In summary iPhones are the cheapest and least reliable, pieces of equipment on the market but are the most expensive out there. My advice is to buy anything else if you have to do anything on the Internet at all."
"iPhone 13","The design looks nice but the function design is stupid/terrible, they placed the 5g antenna location in one of the worst possible places to put it, on the right side of the phone below the power button where your hand grips the phone, what were they thinking! 5G is easily blocked and they placed it in a place where it will have extra barriers to go through and also not to mention all the radiation that is being sent through your hands. A much better place would have been on the top edge of the phone or on the back of the phone or on the bottom edge. But of all the places they put it they placed it in one of the worst possible places if not the worst location. And this is true of the 12 series the 13 series and I believe the 11 series (not sure on 11 as I haven't really seen it)"
"iPhone 13","It‚Äôs literally more expensive than a new one from apple"
"iPhone 13","I am fairly new to iOS...I've been an android user since the very beginning and truth be told, I prefer a lot of that ecosystem to apple's...however, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Cupertino brings to the table and how well they've done it.

Through work I have acquired an iPhone 12 and recently they replaced it with a 13. The phone is virtually identical on the outside...so much that the case I was using on my 12 fit the 13 perfectly. On the outside there are only 2 differences that are fairly easy to spot. First is the smaller notch and on back it's the camera placement. Otherwise, they look the same. This is the pattern that apple has used for a long time and why go and change things now, right? What they changed was almost entirely internal, and you CAN tell a difference.

My 12 booted up from being shut off faster than any android I have ever owned by a pretty significant margin. The 13 is even faster. Not sure how they pulled that off since the 12 was already crazy quick to boot-up, but they did. To give you an idea, I can try to start my iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 Ultra at the same time and not only will the 12 boot up faster, but after it has booted up, I can also start up my 13 and it too will finish just barely ahead of what it took the S21 to pull off. I find that astonishing. Don't get me wrong, I still love my Galaxy, but wow, that is impressive.

I signed up for iOS Beta and downloaded iOS 16. What a wonderful update. The lock screen alone is worth updating your phone. That isn't all, but certainly a nice upgrade. They still can't truly do ""live"" wallpaper (c'mon apple, when are going to finally give in and allow it???) but they come a lot closer than they have previously.

Some of the photo advancements are absolutely phenomenal. Being able to long press on a photo and pull images right out of the background is truly wicked cool and a feature I guarantee a lot of people will get a kick out of. I have used it a LOT since finding it. Seriously, it could be my favorite new tool from iOS 16.

Being able to see a WiFi password on your phone in order to share it with others may seem like a simple thing but it is absolutely a genius idea and something we all should have had access to from the very beginning. Trust me, at some point it'll come in handy you watch.

There are honestly too many cool new tweaks to mention here. Many of them will also be available to older iPhone models when you get iOS 16, but I truly enjoy the implementation on the 13. If truth be told I would have preferred an iPhone 13 Pro Max (I prefer bigger phones in general) but when you get a phone for free thru work, I guess I can't complain now can i?

One additional thing I have noticed with the 13 is absolutely incredibly battery life. It's a smaller battery than my S21 Ultra (by a lot, 5,000 mAh vs 3,227 mAh) and yet the iPhone will run circles around my Samsung battery-wise. Seriously, it isn't even remotely close. OS optimization still ranks as one of the things apple continues to do better than pretty much everyone else and clearly that is still the case and they only increase that gap here. Kudos to apple for this truly amazing improvement.

The truth of the matter is this: android and iOS are blurring the lines between what each can do with each new update...but that's a good thing. Do I prefer my 13 to my S21? Well that is a difficult thing to answer. In some ways I clearly appreciate iOS more...in other ways, Samsungs iteration of Android is the clear winner. As I said, as they blur the lines those differences become harder to define and the truth is, it comes down to which OS do you prefer using overall? For me, I like them both. Some parts more than others, but iOS 16 makes it harder than ever before for me to hate on apple. I really LOVE my iPhone 13...and from a die-hard android fan, that is definitely saying something.

***UPDATE***

I have noticed something I forgot to mention earlier. The 5G service on the 13 is significantly improved over what I was getting with the 12. Not sure why it seems so much better, but it is a noticeable improvement and found it worthy of mentioning.

I signed up for the iOS Beta program and upgraded to iOS 16 and after installing the second Beta update, I have experienced a few bugs that have been annoying and I'm sure will be fixed in an upcoming update. My messages app is all out of whack. Hard to describe, but you start a chat and it doesn't show what you're typing, you have to minimize the keyboard first. Not always, but it's enough and appears unexpectedly that it is a royal pain when it happens.

I am also having difficulty with sending text messages. I can receive them, but I can't seem to send them. I have re-started my phone multiple times to see if it may reset by doing so, but so far, no luck. I had zero issues with the first iOS Beta 16 update...not so much with the second. Just an FYI.

***UPDATE #2***

I am almost at the point where I genuinely prefer my iPhone to my Galaxy S21 Ultra. ALMOST. I still prefer a bigger screen (the Pro Max would solve this, obviously) and as long as I can use an S-Pen that will almost always make me prefer it over anything apple produces.

However...I signed up to be a Beta tester and downloaded iOS 16 and wow...game changing update. The lock screen alone makes it drastically improved. The ability to long-press on an image within a photo and save it almost like a photoshop cut-out is absolutely and unabashedly a fantastic tool that amazes literally everyone who has seen it (including me). My Galaxy though has image erase which to me is even more useful and works surprisingly well...and I use it almost daily. Obviously apple could do this, but I truly believe that apple would rather not add a feature after an android model has had it for fear of looking like they are copying. Oh eventually they give in, but it usually takes several years. As an example, wireless charging took FOREVER to come to apple. I had it with my Nexus 4 almost 10 YEARS ago. Steve Jobs said 3.5 inch screen was the perfect size and as long as he was in charge, the iPhone wouldn't expand...and it never did - til he passed away. The very first iPhone with a bigger screen didn't happen til 2014 with the iPhone 6 Plus and instantly became their biggest selling device to date. All I'm saying is apple could (and should) copy this feature for their phones. Knowing Cupertino, they could not only include it, but improve it considerably. Samsung had it with the introduction of the S21 and the Pixel 6 introduced it too...but for some reason it seems that the fact Samsung had it before them went unnoticed. Go figure. I don't care WHO had it first, I just care that genuinely useful tech be adopted properly and in ways that helps it WORK - which is what apple does better than almost anyone. Face it, no matter what tech is adopted by android ahead of apple, you can bet when the iPhone eventually gets around to introducing it, their version of it will be smoother and probably more reliable. Not always, but in most cases? Yes.

I still wish apple would adopt TRUE live wallpaper that animates whenever your screen is on because what they have that they consider to be live wallpaper just plain ISN'T no matter what apple or anyone else says. iOS 16 does improve upon that with the astronomy wallpaper, but it isn't quite the same. Not sure why apple won't pull the plug on it, either. They do with certain watch faces which are crazy popular, but not their phones. I find that just weird.

All in all I am slowly but surely becoming a giant fan of iOS. The differences between android and apple are becoming more and more blurred with each new update and iteration of each's operating system and I think that's a good thing. Each offers plenty that you cannot get with the other and just the way things operate differentiate what you end up going with and that's okay. I just wish apple products didn't cost 30-75% more than many android equivalents. But hey, this IS a capitalist society and if you can get that price, why not charge it?"
"iPhone 13","Thank you Apple for the 2' cord and no charge plug. $1000 well spent."
"iPhone 13","First I‚Äôll say that I like the MagSafe chargers that are also available on the 12, besides that this phone is worse than the XS. The camera is not good at taking close ups, the battery lasts a day if I have it on low power mode and close apps I‚Äôm not using. 5G is obviously not ready for the public and I‚Äôve never had to restart my phones this often either."
"iPhone 13","The reason you see so many negative reviews is Apple is very difficult to work with when you have a problem with a feature. You can get their hardware fixed, but if you have an issue with anything else it is absolutely terrible to work with Apple. You have to go through all kinds of authentication. Once you give them the info, they will not provide a support ticket. Instead you will get an auto response from a no reply e-mail address. Apple support is a huge black hole."
"iPhone 13","I needed a new phone for a long time. I so pleased with this purchase. It takes good pictures stays charged forever and the face recognition is great."
"iPhone 13","The battery and look of the phone are like new and it works just as good as a new iphone. all the apps, connections, and features work normally"
"iPhone 13","The product stop working within 2 days of purchase"

"iPhone 13","It is a refurbished device, yes. But it's still great!. I've had it for two months now, didn't come with any scratches, hasn't had any weird glitch, and has responded great to all the stuff i download it there ! (getting a 128gb iPhone for less than $900 sounds like a fair deal knowing how over priced iphones are lol). The only thing is that the charger wasn't the original one but hey at least it brought a charger and a phone in perfect condition! It is also unlocked and i will finish it paying in December (I got it with klarna), which I feel it's fair compared to the iPhone 11 i got from at&t in 2019 and finished paying in December 2021 with the monthly payments being $150 lol."
"iPhone 13","It came fast and in great condition, you cant even tell it‚Äôs a renewed phone!"
"iPhone 13","Worth it seems brand new definitely worth it and can‚Äôt beat the price"
"iPhone 13","Phone works beautifully! Shipped fast. (ordered ""new"" condition)"

"iPhone 13","Was nervous to buy iphone online other than from apple or my tmobil store but glad I did! It was 100‚Äôs of dollars cheaper and it didnt make my bill go higher in which I was trying to avoid. I wanted to buy a phone straight out! This phone came in perfect condition and works amazing."
"iPhone 13","Le bas du cellulaire √©tait ¬´ bris√© ¬ª on vois des entailles grise car il a eu des coups.

"iPhone 13","A los 2 d√≠as de uso dejo de cargar. Llego casi nuevo pero evidentemente defectuoso"
"iPhone 13 mini","It arrived a day early, had no scratches and it came with a new screen protector already on it, charger cord and the charging box."
"iPhone 13 mini","Replaces my se 5 which I also loved many years. I am so happy with this Mini 13. The facial recognition is amazing and I do not miss the home button. In the time I‚Äôve had the renewed mini 13 the performance and battery life has been great, like new in fact. Only one or two events where screen hung up however, I‚Äôm attributing that to internet connectivity which can occur in my location. The cosmetics were like new, I did notice a very micro minute scratch on screen which is so unnoticeable that I almost didn‚Äôt want to even mention here, hardly a defect. Overall if you‚Äôre thinking of upgrading with this seller, I would say go for it, jump in and enjoy!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Used/refurbished iPhone 13 mini with very few scratches, only on the back. I'm satisfied."
"iPhone 13 mini","I was a bit weary buying a phone from a seller I haven‚Äôt bought from before, that‚Äôs a lot of trust when spending $600. I‚Äôve waited a few weeks to write this review to make sure all was well. The phone came in great condition with no scratches, nicks or dents. Battery condition said it was still at 100% so that was really nice. All and all very satisfied with the seller.

Now to the review of the phone itself.
This is a fantastic phone in every way. I‚Äôve bought budget phones for 10 years now because I couldn‚Äôt afford the best money could buy. The last iPhone I had was the iPhone 5. This happened to be within my budget and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the phone itself. I was coming from a pixel 4a so a slight downsize from a 5.7 in screen to a 5.4 wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. I truly enjoy a smaller phone as I have small hands and find large heavy phones annoying. To have basically a flagship phone but in smaller packaging has been great. Battery life is actually a lot better than expected and Lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. If your hesitant to get this phone, don‚Äôt be! I will update the review if anything changes but so far I‚Äôm absolutely in love with my new phone."
"iPhone 13 mini","Shipping was very fast I received the product much sooner than anticipated which was a good thing. However I think I would‚Äôve been better off buying a new iPhone mini 13 this one didn‚Äôt even come with the original packaging it was just bubble wrapped with a charger and cable thrown in for looks. The charging block and cable quickly failed after only a couple of uses and I had to go buy a new charging cable and a new charging block the phone is charging fine now. I actually had to reset the phone to factory settings before I used it?!? I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on something that‚Äôs either new or renewed I wouldn‚Äôt buy a $650 iPhone from this vendor again."
"iPhone 13 mini","La bater√≠a no est√° bueno"
"iPhone 13 mini","No vino cargador como dec√≠a que ven√≠a, lo dem√°s todo bien"
"iPhone 13 mini","Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it didn‚Äôt come with the actual iPhone box it just came in a zip lock bag and did not come with the proper charger it states it would come with and for almost paying retail price I would of really liked to have the box and the actual charger it supposed to come with which is the usb c to lighting cable but yeah apple is skimming us by not giving us headphones or a charging brick now days they say it‚Äôs for the environment but that‚Äôs bs only saves them money while the consumer pays extra will update my review if I have to as I continue using the phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","Just know if you buy plug for the wall that this phone comes with the old style cord not the new"
"iPhone 13 mini","Thanks Loreta"
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone In Acceptable condition and hoped for the best and i could not be more satisfied. The phone came with zero scratches, dents or cracks and on top of that i got a free screen protector. Apart from the unoriginal apple box and the minor fact that someone else owned this device, i dont see why anyone would buy a brand new phone for 200 dollars more. The only downside to this purchase was the fact they gave me an iphone 12 mini screen protector instead of the 13 mini one but who cares. Totally Worth My Money!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Unlocked phone works good came with a screen protector."
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone arrived on time and was like a new one. No scratches, no problems. I took the sim from my old phone and put it in the new one and followed along with what popped up. It worked perfectly. So I purchased another one for me. This one was for my wife"
"iPhone 13 mini","Can‚Äôt really rate much yet, as we just received this product a week ago. But of all the refurbished phones we‚Äôve bought through Amazon this is the only that‚Äôs ever come with scratches on the screen. A little disappointed in that."
"iPhone 13 mini","Very surprised of the condition of the phone, battery life was at 100%, no scratches or smudges."
"iPhone 13 mini","Upgraded from iPod touch - which I still have and use. Got this renewed item due to new not being available. Prefer smaller size that mini fulfills. Actually bigger than expected. Just right."
"iPhone 13 mini","It was everything I was hoping for and more, everything is working like I‚Äôd hoped and the battery is at 100% health. My only issue is with a small delay on the buttons but it‚Äôs barely noticeable unless I‚Äôm really focusing on it. 10/10 must buy"
"iPhone 13 mini","I‚Äôve always purchased my phones new so I was a little leary about ordering a preowned phone, but I am so happy I did! I ordered through the seller HQTRONIC LLC on 3/21 and received it on 3/24 which was way earlier than the expected delivery date of 3/29-4/4. Upon opening the shipping box, the phone was wrapped in a foam sleeve and there was a new charging cord and plug included. There was not a single scratch or any knicks on the phone‚Ä¶it looks new! I was a little concerned as the battery was at 2%, but I charged it up and battery health shows 100%! I upgraded to this from a 5 year old iPhone 7 which was having issues with the battery and I had to keep it on a charging cord most of the day and I‚Äôm so happy that I decided to upgrade. I‚Äôm a very happy customer and the savings on this certified renewed iPhone will practically pay for a full year of my Mint Mobile service! Thank you HQTRONIC LLC and Amazon!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Works great! Good solid phone with excellent battery life does what it should no problems. The mini size is nice because I can easily control what I‚Äôm doing with one hand and it fits in my pocket very nicely. Don‚Äôt care for the pink just got a good deal on it and with my Otter Box you can‚Äôt tell."
"iPhone 13 mini","I was hesitant on purchasing a refurbished phone as it was my first time. I am pleasantly surprised on what a great deal it was I love my new phone thanks !"
"iPhone 13 mini","Me lleg√≥ en condiciones excelentes, pr√°cticamente nuevo"
"iPhone 13 mini","package does not come with official apple charger or sim card opener !!
phone is real tho, i just think they should‚Äôve made them bigger"
"iPhone 13 mini","Almost perfect! The body of the phone is in really good condition I don‚Äôt see any scratches or scrapes or dents or cracks the only issue with the body I see is there‚Äôs some discoloration in the top right corner it looks like the blue was worn off a little bit and is now silver in that one spot I‚Äôve added a photo in the spot everything else with the phone seems to be in really good condition I just wish that discoloration in the top corner wasn‚Äôt there"
"iPhone 13 mini","If I didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd bought a used phone, I would have thought this was new. The battery is at 100% health, I can‚Äôt find any blemishes on the screen or backing, and everything booted up like new. The package even came with a new charging cable and a charging brick. I didn‚Äôt need another brick but it‚Äôs nice that it was there I guess."
"iPhone 13 mini","I liked that it could fit in a pocket easily But I needed my glasses to be able to see it and I just need a little extra space I went to the 13 regular but overall I really like the phone it‚Äôs got a lot of features and smooth transitions"
"iPhone 13 mini","The mini was smaller than my old IPhone 6. I thought they were the same size. However I am happy to be able to use all my Apps now! The old phone did not support a lot of Apps. Everything set up great and no glitches in getting it activated! Love it!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered a pre owned iPhone 13 mini. It arrived in 48 hrs after ordering, much quicker than stated by the seller :) This phone was flawless on the exterior. It has always charged to 100% in the 10 days I have been using it. I have been using it. All other features have full functionality. I‚Äôm so glad I made this choice. Kudos to the seller and the top notch quality of this iPhone 13 mini!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I needed a new iPhone and I wanted to see if I could save some cash by buying refurbished. The iPhone 13 mini I received was like new no scratches whatsoever. Very pleased. I ended up saving damn near $100 enough to get me a case and screen protector with left over money."
"iPhone 13 mini","Zero issues, good service and Great phone condition, I loved it."
"iPhone 13 mini","My face recognition is not available, my battery life was at 91% and at first i could not download any apps that didn‚Äôt come with the phone without a credit card. Other than that, the screen and no scratches or cracks and the phone had no dents."
"iPhone 13 mini","Quick delivery, excellent product condition and great pricing!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Like new. It‚Äôs been working perfectly for a few months now. 100% battery and processor health. Great buy so far."
"iPhone 13 mini","This iPhone turned out to be everything I expected it to be."
"iPhone 13 mini","Came without box but the ph is in great condition."
"iPhone 13 mini","Like new no problems even overseas"
"iPhone 13 mini","I love my phone I got the color pink I order my phone and come the next day pacifically a day early.

"iPhone 13 mini","Looks like the iPhone 13 but fails to provide all the bells and whistles of the real phone, I upgraded from an iPhone SE and the face camera picture quality is identical, the phone will sometimes hick up and glitch a little when changing between apps, doesn't come with the iPhone 13 wall papers and settings, did not come with the recent iPhone 12 update.

Walks like a iPhone 13, quacks like one, but just isn't the same. I understand this may be how refurbished phones are but I was expecting it to feel more like the actual iPhone 13."
"iPhone 13 mini","I really like my new phone"

"iPhone 13 mini","Buena compra"
"iPhone 13 mini","The smartphone, taken separately, is in excellent condition. There is no problem.

The only downside is that it is not in the original box. The USB cable is also not original. This is a little bad.
However, the phone itself is in perfect condition."
"iPhone 13 mini","It looks brand new and battery is still at 100% capacity, no scratch except 2 hair line scratch on the screen but only noticeable when close-up. I installed glass screen protector and its not noticeable anymore."

"iPhone 13 mini","Easy set up, no problems, good condition. Worth while purchase!"
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone itself is perfectly fine. But the charging cable it comes with is obviously the cheapest one they could get, but it does work. The power brick on the other hand, feels so cheap and has minimal markings on it indicating its safety, that I immediately threw it in the trash and recommend that everyone else does the same. The listing description also says that it comes with a SIM removal tool, which it did not.

If you're just here for the phone, and don't care about everything else it comes with, then this thing is great."
"iPhone 13 mini","Nice, for a good price!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I'm not an iPhone user but bought this for my future wife and omg..looks brand new! Can't wait to give it to her in 2month oversea. I hope nothing is wrong since I only turn it on to make sure there's no Crack during shipping. A+ so far until she geeks out on it."

"iPhone 13 mini","This phone came in immaculate condition and has 100% battery life. Also cheaper than brand new. What more could you ask for in a renewed phone? This is my first time buying from amazon renewed. Amazing first impression. I will be back for my next."
"iPhone 13 mini","Works like brand new no scratches or visible damage very happy with the cheaper phone"

"iPhone 13 mini","El cable del cargador no sirve. El tel√©fono tiene una raya en la pantalla."
"iPhone 13 mini","Good phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","I had this delivered less than 10 mins ago and it arrived scrapped. The top right portion was scrapped as well as a minor one on the bottom right. The charging port and cable are not Apple brand, they are second hand brands. I have submitted my return request and will be expecting my money back. Overall this phone took about a week to get here and couldn‚Äôt even use it when it finally did get here. I will create an update if my refund is not returned in a timely manner."
"iPhone 13 mini","Perfect and battery life 100% no dents no scratch
Packaging was a lil scruffy but it‚Äôs used ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

Battery life is incredible."
"iPhone 13 mini","Like"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone with great hopes to replace my old Iphone 8 and I thought for a 512gb it was a steal price. After having it for 3 days, it showed signs of defects with the camera and videos (lines on the side of the pictures/videos recorded) I really wanted to keep this phone but I returned it for the reason that it won‚Äôt probably last me longer than 1 year and it would show more defects over time. With this experience I probably won‚Äôt be buying any renewed phone EVER. Just buy the brand new item and add the extra $80 to keep it working for years than the risk of having a problem within a week/year is high with these type of renewed phones."
"iPhone 13 mini","The seller sent the wrong phone - i ordered a 13 mini but the seller delivered a 12 mini. I ordered a red phone - the seller delivered a white one. Most importantly, the phone is borken. It does not recognize any of several valid, working SIM cards that I and my cell provider tried in it. Further, amazon made it difficult to return this item. I've thus had to contest the charge with my credit card company. IMHO Wal-Mart provides a better on-line shopping experience."
"iPhone 13 mini","received phone in good physical condition, however it is carrier locked and the description clearly says UNLOCKED. for the price of the phone renewed, it is better to buy it new. never again!"
"iPhone 13 mini","i purchased this product in June 2022 and gifted to my cuisine who is staying in different county . But last week i came to know that Battery is fully drained and not able switching ON.
They are thinking that i gifted poor quality product."
"iPhone 13 mini","looks so cheap, not impressive"
"iPhone 13 mini","For some reason while I was talking on the phone, the screen just randomly turned green. It never went away and there was nothing on YOUTUBE or google to explain the problem. Took it to a local business that fixes phones but they said that its the screen that is damaged and it stems from the actual manufacturer. They must have used a lower quality screen. It's going to cost me about $200 to fix apparently. It's sad because the phone was great up until two weeks of using it. Very disappointed with my purchase."
"iPhone 13 mini","El tel√©fono es renovado pero deb√≠a verse como nuevo. La pantalla ten√≠a rayones raz√≥n por la cual realic√© la devoluci√≥n."
"iPhone 13 mini","only lasted a few months and now will not turn on. Phone has entered a boot loop and is now an expensive paper weight."
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought an Iphone 13 mini Unlocked right? Well when trying to connect it to my carrier it would not work, kept giving me an error message. Went in and looked‚Ä¶LOCKED with T-Mobile. I had to take the phone to T-Mobile to get it unlocked which was not free. With the money I spent I should have bought a brand new one. The company selling this device was rude and would not listen to the problem I was having. If I could give this company -5 stars I would!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I brought the Apple 13 mini UNLOCKED! When I received my product it wasn‚Äôt unlocked, it was with sprint. I checked my order and it said I purchased unlock. After many phone calls with Sprint they couldn‚Äôt unlock the phone because the previous owner did not have the phone for 40 days active with them. I contacted the seller and all they did was ask me for my IMEI code on the phone. My phone is still LOCKED. Will update soon."
"iPhone 13 mini","Save your money. This phone is awful. It freezes constantly. The keypad is so far off texting is a nightmare. The facial recognition works about fifty percent of the time. It is so slow‚Ä¶ my 8 year old iphone 8 was faster"
"iPhone 13 mini","Phone has many scratches even thought said it was like new and not great battery life"
"iPhone 13 mini","No es bueno"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone unlocked and when I finally got it after order was delayed 3 times it wasn‚Äôt even unlocked like it said"
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","The battery life is really good.But the iPhone was scratched and dirtyIt's not worth buying"
"iPhone 13 mini","Won't connect to my carrier, even though it's supposed to be unlocked. So either it's locked or the sim slot is busted."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","Freezes and cuts off randomly, at least 5 times a day. Will be returning soon if problems persist."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone partly based on the reviews posted here and have to say it met my high expectations. My suspicion is that these are possibly just display models that are sold off as for all intents and purposes the phone shipped to me was new. No scratches or blemishes were on it and it has 100% remaining battery life. It had an out of date software version needing upgrading before use which tells me it had probably never been connected to wifi or a cell provider before and possibly never even turned on which is how it appears. The only little drawback that happened is that I didn‚Äôt receive the Color I ordered, however that is not the fault of the seller as the Color marked on the product box was not what was inside. Based on my experience I wholeheartedly recommend buying from this site."
"iPhone 13 mini","These phones are still priced as if the MSRP is 699$. Apple reduced the brand new price of this phone to 599 2 months ago... making these an awful value at 579$ when you can get it brand new with an apple warranty for 599. I'd not consider a less then excellent condition renewed product at anything more then 450$ at this point."
"iPhone 13 mini","Good price for a nice and non scratched iphone. Even though it came with no adaptor the seller is supportive to accept return.."
"iPhone 13 mini","I purchased this iPhone Mini recently (even if not through Amazon). A critical issue keeps coming up that is making me think I've made a mistake. Apple has failed to update to the newest standard of texting. Why? Tim Cook has said ""buy your mom an iPhone"" if you want texting to work nicely with her.So when I get photos texted in a thread where there is even just a single non-Apple device in the group chat, *all* images comes in as low-res photo in the thread. That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple's actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device. This is madness, and at times I'm now finding myself embarrassed to own an iPhone."
"iPhone 13 mini","The raves are seductive, maybe the colors, too. But once inside, unless you are a pixel-fixated addict, many things may leave you wanting. No home button, No touch ID! Camera fixtures protruding from the back side produce a rather scabby look and feel, so unlike a Steve Jobs design, no? And a technically ‚Äúlarger‚Äù screen than the SE, but as skinny as a tunnel.All of which, up close in hand, made it easy for me to commit to the SE 2022. Feels solid. Feels fine enough. I will forever miss my original SE, how light in weight. Apple had to blow that, too."
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought it in excellent condition. But on the phone itself there were a couple scratches. Gunk in a few spots too. Wouldn‚Äôt say it was excellent condition. Would‚Äôve bought brand new if I knew. The phone internally is okay. But if you want a new phone In excellent condition id honestly just go to Best Buy and spend like a 100 more to get your moneys worth."
"iPhone 13 mini","Me hicieron un cambio de color antes de enviarlo por que me equivoqu√© de color al pedirlo.Todo a funcionado Perfecto.Sin problemas de Env√≠o. Lleg√≥ antes de lo esperado. Feliz!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Ordered iPhone 13 Mini in Midnight 128gb. Product came as described in perfect condition with 100% battery health. Even came with an apple brick and MFI cable. Definitely recommend"
"iPhone 13 mini","Thos os my 6th phone. I have had so m8ch trouble with cell phones. Now I am pleased with the one I chose!!!!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Buyer beware, Amazon guarantee states ""The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.""Mine arrived with multiple small blemishes on the screen that looked like dust/fine hair, but can't be wiped off - invisible from 12 inches away, but who only uses a phone a foot away from their head.Highly recommend the 13 mini -- Great camera, battery life, and performance. I would advise against Amazon renewed though."
"iPhone 13 mini","Great deal good phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone a few weeks ago. It came with a screen protector already on and is in pristine condition. No scratches or dings. Battery at 100% capacity. So happy with the phone!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Arrived in 3 days, even though I was worried about the condition of a used iPhone, I was so surprised by the product.Not even a small scratch, camera, faceID is working properly and the phone itself is so fast. Even more shocking that the battery health is on 100.Came with a third party USB-A to lightning cable which I wouldn‚Äôt use and with a SIM-tool.I can highly recommend renewed products now."
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone came in a good condition, although there were small almost un-noticeable scratches. It also arrived right on time. Even got a free screen protector installed! The small form factor is absolutely amazing and I love how effective and efficient it is. I got it in the midnight colour and I am completely inlove!"
"iPhone 13 mini","13 mini works great showed up in great condition !"
"iPhone 13 mini","Absolutely like new. Was given a power brick and new cable as well. Definitely worth it.Give recycled tech a go, it goes a long way."
"iPhone 13 mini","Muy buen producto"
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 the phone came in with no scratches or dents the Battery health was at a surprising 98% The face id works like a charm. Also this is my first time buying a renewed device."

"iPhone 13 mini","Llego azul enlugar de negro pero funciona 100%. Con Telcel Mexico
Bateria 98%"
"iPhone 13 mini","I was scared in the beginning if renewed would be scratched or dented but luckily it was just like a brand new. Unfortunately, had to return since it was too smal for us but it was like brand new."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","I bought the phone brand new with Apple's great guarantee and care, overnight Fedex shipping and paid less than this phone used on Amazon. If the phone were priced at the right price, I would likely have bought it here."
"iPhone 13 mini","I love this phone it works great it rlly fits me because my hands are super duper small overall good quality everything works i suggest getting a fast charger to charge your phone because my charger works with the case !"
"iPhone 13 mini","Good warranty perfect looked brand new for being refurbished no network issues very small good size"
"iPhone 13 mini","THIS WAS ALMOST A NEW PHONE.Guys. If you are looking for a ""used"" phone that's literally not even used, this is where you get it from. Make sure you select the refurbished in excellent condition one. It is practically a new phone. Only thing is, it did not come in the OEM box. But oh wow..... So cool. A white box that you won't really care about. Yeah. This is basically a new phone. Still an Apple product, but a great one nonetheless."
"iPhone 13 mini","This case feels like much better quality than the otterbox case I previously had installed.Pros: It feels like good quality. Perfect fit. Materials definitely seem better than otter box. The edge has much better grip feeling than other cases I‚Äôve had. You get to show off the color of your phone..?Cons: the raised edge around the cameras doesn‚Äôt seem like it is much higher than the camera lenses."
"iPhone 13 mini","I normally don't go for renewed or refurbished phones since I like to buy them new but decided to give it a try here since it was much cheaper than what's on Apple's website. I wasn't disappointed. Received all the parts and for all purposes, I can't tell that this phone has been used before"
