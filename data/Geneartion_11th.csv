"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was I nervous to buy a $500 iphone on Amazon? Yes! I am glad I did, the phone arrived in excellent condition, with a screen protector already on. I'm very happy its not cracked or majorly scratched, I recommend buying this phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was having a real problem (to me) with the ""Zoom"" feature. I must have been unknowingly touching the screen with three fingers, thus enlarging the font too much for the screen size. After de-selecting that ""Zoom"" feature, I became happy again with the purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really enjoyed battery life,facial recognition is something new for me enjoying my iPhone very much"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Okay Reviewers I ordered this IPhone 11 Pro Max off of my sons prime account.. This is one bad ass phone! And I got a great deal from this amazing company! Shipping was on point! And this phone OMG perfect! Like it came from Apple! If I didn‚Äôt know it was refurbished? I would have thought it was never touched! That‚Äôs how perfect it is! I felt like a child at Christmas! Stoked! So, definitely would and will buy from this company again! Thank you for your loyalty to your customers! Super excited! Placed it in a case as soon as I looked at it .
Okay about the iPhone 11 Pro Max .. outside of it‚Äôs beauty . Wish I could take a picture of it , but i can‚Äôt . I‚Äôm on it..
the 11 is holding its value for great reasons .. it really is a bad ass phone !! And the 12‚Äôs are nice but the 11‚Äôs sit right next to those 12‚Äôs ! But cheaper in price but the quality is all the same!
The pictures are amazing!!! ( FYI My son has the 12 My sister 12 pro and brother in law has 12 pro Max ) so pictures are not so noticeably different.. cause this 11 pro Max takes great photos also and the battery life is awesome ! 24 hrs no charge and still had life left! I have charged it with the cord charging ( it came with a good charging cord not junk) and I also have charged it with the magnetic cordless charging.. about the same.
I have not done the face recognition as of yet.. I use a passcode.. I do miss the finger / thumb recognition button but from what I see with my son ? Face recognition is prob just as fast or faster?
The speakers on this is loud! Love it!
Now yes this is a bigger device it is a 6.5 in screen but it‚Äôs not bulky at all ! The phone is slender not heavy but a case did help tremendously holding it cause it‚Äôs so thin.. haha i dont know how to explain that one but I Dont know to drop it haha so a case helps to grip it .. if that makes sense ? Lol
But with the cheaper price tag ? I was able to get the highest GB and still save a few hundred‚Äô dollars!
I did my research cause I was looking at this phone for a while and then was gearing for the 12 pro Max for it has 3 or 4 better features. But After comparing and deep research? What was being said is true! The 11‚Äôs are amazing phones! And unless your a Photographer? You won‚Äôt see a inkling of a difference with the camera or video.. the processor in the 11‚Äôs are also fast and made right! Apple surly did a great job with the 11‚Äôs !!! So again for what you get and with that price tag ? You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Iphome 11 pro Max! I‚Äôm freaking happy I got one heck of a deal ! I love the look ,the quality, how fast it responds, the pictures, the battery life, the features, and the company that I bought it from! Hope this helps with someone‚Äôs research and decision making!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was in new condition and clean operation when received. Upgraded from 7 Plus. A good jump in speed and quality."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and it‚Äôs been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. I‚Äôve gotten the run around told several different story‚Äôs! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still haven‚Äôt seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! It‚Äôs a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! It‚Äôs very aggravating and a headache it‚Äôs not $20 or something it‚Äôs almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully you‚Äôre experience is better!

I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didn‚Äôt know it was ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù I‚Äôd swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and it‚Äôs now 4:23pm the next day and it‚Äôs still yet to go dead I‚Äôve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but that‚Äôs not a big deal I guess. I‚Äôve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! That‚Äôs a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud. If ever needed I will definitely come back to this seller with no hesitation at all! I‚Äôm just very pleased with everything over all!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente servicio y tel√©fonos en lo personal tuve un peque√±o inconveniente pero inmediatamente me dieron soluci√≥n 100% recomendado entre mi familia y amigos"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good but worth the price !
No issues !
Just need a good charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Deben mejorar el nivel de bater√≠a y el estado de la pantalla"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great customer service!!! First phone the volume was low and they returned with no problems. Second phone is perfect!! Will definitely do business again!! Thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Externally the iPhone I flawless, but the battery is not good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very happy with this purchase. Paid for 256 memory. Received phone with 512 memory. I feel I got a fantastic deal."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy correcto y profesional"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great shape, the only reason for the 4 star is there is nothing on the phone or the packaging with the IMEI number. Made it more difficult to get the device activated because you had to get it hooked up to itunes prior to activating the services with my carrier."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with everything a new phone comes with, I had absolutely NO PROBLEM placing my SIM card in it and downloading my other iPhone profile and works perfectly !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Its like brand new,"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs too old and little scratches everywhere. It doesn‚Äôt look like what I saw on the site."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dislike the glitches"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I recommend this product. I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone worked well overall, until a made a phone call. The main speaker on the top front of the phone that sits on your ear during a call must‚Äôve been busted because it was barely audible. There were about 3 deep scratches on the screen as well, all of those was unexpected as I purchased the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. The battery health was 87%, which was acceptable for a used phone. It was great besides the speaker and scratches which I ultimately returned it because of. Return process was smooth and I got my money back within 3-4 days of shipping my return."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I want to recommend that you choose Sikksound to purchase from! I just ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Max silver Friday, received it the following Monday. When I received the package I was kind of nervous because the packaging was so small, but they had everything packed nice and tidy! I had no problems with my SIM card, it worked immediately, I had a little issue with my Apple ID but I figured it out, nothing to do with the seller. The phone didn‚Äôt have a single scratch, it literally looks brand new, LITERALLY! Face ID, touch screen, camera, speaker, everything works! Batter life is at 97%, which is more then I expected! If I ever need to purchase a phone again, I will be purchasing from them! Thank you! üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent condition! Price is great!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in great condition. No cratches. It even had on a screen protector. Phone is currently being used in Jamaica with no issues connecting to the local network."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looks great and even came with its own screen protector like new. I did check my battery life on it and it‚Äôs 82"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have this 4 stars because although the phone was on very good condition. When unboxing it comes with a very sticky protective sheet on top of the screen. Upon removing the sheet unlike apple
Leaves a sticky film covering the entire screen. Water or little soap alone was not able to remove this film.
My husband had to use an adhesive remover a few time to completely remove the film."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I try to swipe it barely can swipe I try to purchase on Amazon to confirm my purchase I have to swipe, it won‚Äôt allow me to swipe and the letters don‚Äôt work properly on key board"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love everything about this phone. Bought it as a gift and they love it. Great condition and great price. Deffinately recommend this phone and this seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone only lasted 6 months."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone working pretty good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","They liked the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice size"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It seems like a brand new phone to me because I can‚Äôt tell the difference."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone itself is very high quality. The graphics are amazing, the apps load quickly, the camera is very nice. The phone is pretty heavy though. I haven‚Äôt noticed that with newer iPhone models so if the weight of the phone might be an issue for you, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this one. The product isn‚Äôt damaged at all and it came with a SIM card remover tool and a charger and charger box. The shipping for me was difficult though. They kept on pushing forward the delivery date up until I had called and went off on them, then it has gotten to my house on time."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When it eventually arrived I was pleasantly surprised how good it looked. I have had a couple of instances where the touchscreen hasn‚Äôt registered on the first/second touch but other than that it has worked well so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm so happy! At first I was skeptical, because I read some negative reviews! I ended up buying the iphone 11 pro max silver 64gb unlocked and I received what i ordered!! I had an iphone 7 plus, and I bought this with my own money. I'm so happy. I love the camera, good screen with NO scratches, and it's so pretty! Will be recommending to my friends and family! although the phone has 84% battery health, but i honestly don't care. mine old phone was in the 70's lol. :)))))))))))))"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good price and works perfect! The only reason I had purchased an Android over a month ago was I didn‚Äôt want to pay for a bigger iPhone 11. So after a month of working on that droid, I found this iPhone 11 Pro Max at a reasonable price. Always will buy renewed iPhones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","VERY HAPPY FIND OF THIS PHONE!!
was skeptical about buying an used phone because I always buy the refurbished ones directly from apple but now it was not the case because inflation and prices going up.

Had do give my newest ip 13 and go back to this one due to bad battery and that I didnt like the feel of the ip13 and this really gave my hopes back.

Avant Solutions was my seller and it had all original parts, not icloud locked and, the battery health was at 92% !!!! The listing for these phones guarantees at least more than 80% but this was much better.

As any used phone, it should have knicks and dents and mine only had a small scratch on an edge (presumably because previous owner drop it without a case on) and it came with a tempered glass on!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was just as expected! The product even came with a screen protector and was just as described. Great job!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal use. I like everything for now"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dropped out of my pocket when I sat in a chair (2‚Äô off the ground) and the middle of my screen cracked."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone came in 3 days, perfect condition very satisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn't expect it to get stuck every few days during important calls or using apps. The screen freezes and occasionally closed out of an app while in use without saving changes or progress. Hardware was in great condition, but using this phone made it difficult to complete tasks, access docs/drives to share, access photos and at the very least mute or increase volume during calls."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was ok but the screen is faulty. Phone fell with screen protector AND a phone case on. Somehow only the phone screen broke while the screen protector was intact"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought mine from chubbiestech and they did good. The phone had no scratches fully functional and battery health was 87% and it‚Äôs pretty good. Other than that it was perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the 11 pro max ( obvi lol ) , silver , 256 gb . i was a tiny bit nervous due to some of the negative reviews but i jus got this phone and initially it‚Äôs fine to me . it came unlocked , no previous icloud was linked to it . all buttons work fine , camera is fine , face id is fine , volume / speakers are fine . battery capacity is at 87% which is fine cus i currently have an xr , 64 gb , 73% capacity .. so a bit of an upgrade for me . it‚Äôs so new to me ( like an hour old ) so i haven‚Äôt set it up yet but like i said it came unlocked and the imei number ( or whatever lol ) says ‚Äú no sim restrictions ‚Äú so i believe it‚Äôs unlocked and i don‚Äôt believe i‚Äôll have any problems setting it up. like i said i literally jus got the phone but so far i‚Äôm really happy & relieved & inlove .. and it came w a bit of mild scratching only on the sides of the phone but i‚Äôll have a case on it anyways , no screen scratches or scratches on the back or on neither cameras . hopefully it lasts a couple years or so and it also has a 90 day return / replacement warranty ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo mejor es el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is good but a red dot came on my camera."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My only MAJOR complaint is that the speaker is a little damaged. Music sounds staticky and so do phone calls from both ends. But the face recognition, battery life and camera all looks brand new. So you get what you pay for with this one. All in all I definitely don‚Äôt regret buying a renewed phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a hit and Miss. You can either get a good condition Version or a totally scratched up phone that was previously owend by a cat."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is amazing I‚Äôm so happy I ordered from them my phone came so fast and it looked brand new no scratches or anything!! Camera is so clear as well!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like in the title this is an amazing phone that works perfectly except for the speaker i mentioned. To clarify the speakers work but the bottom speaker seems to have some water damage because it makes slight static noises and is muffled a bit. Couldn‚Äôt find a fix for this but it‚Äôs a minor problem compared to everything else. So far, i would recommend paying for the renewed premium option and i‚Äôll update this review if anything major happens."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very satisfied with the purchase got it today phone was spanking new !!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","You would think spending this much for a used product it would at least be functional, but not the case for this guy. Phone has 82% battery and dropped 50% life sitting in my pocket for 2.5 hours meaning I have 5 hours of max life when not using. Have my appointment to get the battery replaced as I would rather pay $69 for a new one than go through the hassle of a return and repurchase. Based on other reviews it looks like you are rolling the dice in batteries period. Would recommend adding $69 out of pocket for anyone using these refurbished phones. Outside of battery, everything else seems top notch so far. Bought my wife a refurbished from another vendor that came with a new battery and will be going with them next time for my own.

Update - seller stated that in the end I purchased a refurbished (so essentially buyer beware in their own words!) and could send it in for a replacement, but cannot guarantee it will be better as it is another refurbish. Still spending the $69 to simply fix the issue with a new battery and would encourage any one purchasing from them to add that to your true total cost. Next time will buy directly from apple with a legit guarantee as my cost to go with this seller is only $100 cheaper in total spent, but now with a clearly lower quality refurbish and customer support team. Not worth the time and hassle and lesson learned."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery health was 100% when i got it. This kicks my 2020 SE‚Äôs ass for sure"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone in very good condition. Minor scratch on screen but nothing to worry about."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So for my birthday I was gifted the iPhone 11 which was really nice at first but 3 days in it started to crack. And the longer the day went on the more the cracks started to spread.
So had to return that phone which made me very skeptical of getting the iPhone 11 Pro Max instead.
I had literally no problems with setting it up or transferring everything, which was such a relief.

Have had this phone for a few months and so far no cracks, no scrapes, camera works beautiful, and I can actually hear people when I‚Äôm on the phone! The iPhone 11 had TERRIBLE audio and I always had to turn on speaker for calls yet could barely hear.

I don‚Äôt normally do reviews but this surprised me with how well it‚Äôs going. üôåüèªü•πü•π"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone has issues with the earpiece unless I use hands free or EarPods I have to use the speaker I like the memory space"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pristine condition with 100% battery health, thanks Amazon for another great iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i gave 4 stars cuz sometimes the phone glitches out and i can‚Äôt touch the screen but other than that everything is good. my battery health was at 85 when i got it (may 24) and it‚Äôs still at 85."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone shipped exactly like the description. Works perfectly and just what I wanted."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My IPhone 11 Pro Max arrived much earlier than the delivery date, the phone looks like new just a tiny scratch in the screen but you don‚Äôt eve notice, it come with a different charger but works fine and charge fast, the battery life was 82%, no that bad for a refurbished phone. so far the phone works very well let's see what happens later. But I will definitely buy again from the seller Refoned!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","If you‚Äôre like me, you don‚Äôt want to get wrapped up in a contract for a brand new phone, but you still want to feel like you‚Äôre not far behind the newest iPhone. Well, this is it. I upgraded from the Xr and it‚Äôs a night and day difference. The iPhone 11 Pro Max should be the go to for anyone looking to stay in the ballpark of $500 for a phone. I feel as though this phone will still still be relevant for a while."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","To be honest I can't really rate the product due to the fact that I haven't had the phone for a month. So far so good ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After looking at my options this phone and Amazon‚Äôs warranty seemed like my best option. It is like new and a breeze to set up. My only complaint was it came with a vinyl screen protector that was poorly installed. It was peeling off when I got it do just removed it. Replaced my failing 8+ and is a nice upgrade!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was totally amazed by this phone. it came with 98% battery health and the phone was spotless. Besides the box and the refurbish notes that come with it, you would think this phone was brand new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I RARELY leave any reviews but I'm DISAPPOINTED because I paid the extra money for the ""excellent condition"" to avoid things like this. (sorry for the pictures. hard to capture the dents on such a shiny surface, tried to include flash and no flash pics and this might be a little long)

Straight out the box, there is not only a scratch on one of the back cameras that shows up through pictures, (I checked) and another one on the surrounding glass of all three cameras on the back but also the front-facing camera has little DENTS/DIVETS. The ENTIRE device has these little dents all throughout the phone. Many of them are scattered over the screen, a cluster of them on the back (that I forgot to take a picture of), HOWEVER, the sides are the worst. It is pretty noticeable, even from a foot or 12 inches away as the description described. I'm not even sure what could cause that because on the sides it mostly looks internal. It is a different color entirely from the color of the phone.

ALSO, as you can see from the pictures it is also like DIRTY? There is some weird white substance in the grooves/seems on all four sides of the ENTIRE phone. The white substance was neither in the amazon box, the box the phone came in, nor in the sleeve that the phone was placed in so that means it was packaged with whatever the white stuff is and sent.

To top it off, the battery capacity is only 84% PERCENT. This is not in ""excellent condition.""

Pretty disappointed because other customers seemed to have a pretty good experience. Going to have to return which annoys me because I rarely do returns as well and try to avoid it. :("
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS AMAZED HOW NEW THIS PHONE LOOKED NOT ONE SCRATCH I WILL SAY THERE IS 1 tiny tiny chip of paint missing by the camera lens but it‚Äôs super tiny it‚Äôs more lik a dot not noticeable at all other than that not one mark I transferred my service over with no problem everything works no glitches or problems AT ALL AND AT FIRST I BOUGHT THIS SAME IPHONE FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER ON HERE FOR ALMOST $200 MORE AND WAS SENT A SUPER SMALL IPHONE SO I SENT IT BCK AND FOUND THIS ONE SO IM GLAD I HAD THAT HAPPEN CUZ THIS ONE WORKS AMAZING AND I PAID $200 LESS AND IVE SEARCHED ON HERE THIS IS THE CHEAPEST IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ON AMAZON SO IF UR LOOKING FOR THIS IPHONE UNLOCKED THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY AND 1 MORE THING I HAVE METRO BY T-MOBILE AND IT HOOKED UP WITH NO PROBLEMS"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","only thing I didn't like was the length it took to get here. but love the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our iPhone 11 Pro Max we received was virtually flawless. The screen had no scratches, but the battery did require more charging. Nonetheless, the transferring of data/files was easy, as we took both phones to an AT&T store. All was done in less than 30 minutes. The part that took the longest was adding the Apple Watch to the new phone. The whole process took another 40 minutes. Overall, the entire experience was very positive. This is our 3rd phone purchase from the Renewed at Amazon, and have not had a bad experience thus far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic quality phone out of the box. Thanks seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","From the point I placed my order, the seller was straight forward with the order. I originally ordered a silver 11 pro max and that color was out of stock so the seller worked with me getting me a space grey model instead! Within hours, the order had been shipped out and I got it 2 days later. Extremely well packaged, the phone was on and ready to go with a full battery. Inserted my SIM card (for Verizon) and there were no issues, started right up on my network, no issues with the ESN (clean, not blacklisted). I‚Äôve had it for roughly a week and a half and it works great! No issues, looks brand new, came with a third party charger and cable (not apple certified cube) and a sim port pin. I‚Äôd highly recommend this seller and would gladly order again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono estaba desbloqueado, bater√≠a 90%. Muy bueno."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is great just it‚Äôs legit and is the exact thing that you pay for I was spectacle at first but once it arrived I was excited that I got what I expected I do suggest reading the description first because a lot of people made me get mixed emotions about buying this phone online. But overall it all worked out in the end and I‚Äôm happy so I definitely recommend buying."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","üßêüßêüßê"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was nervous to buy after seeing so many bad reviews , but the phone is great! Its in Excellent condition. I had a hard time finding any scuffs or marks i dont think i have any. Everything is as promised i just wish my battery health was higher than 82% otherwise it wouldve been a 5 star rating"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was the renewed and not the renewed premium so I figured there may be superficial damage but I did not realize there would be a decent handful of micro scratches directly to the screen. I opened the box and was immediately disappointed. It looked like something I could have bought from a random guy in a mall food court rather than a refurbished phone. The scratches were not huge or deep but where very visible when the light hit them even at an arms length to everyone that looked at it. Requested the return a few minutes after opening the box and shipped it back the very next morning. I did get a quick refund with no real hassle but would have rather had a phone with a decent screen. I then ordered the renewed premium. The last two photos are what I ended up receiving where someone had put on a tape type protector that left a disgusting layer of thick sticky residue completely covering the touch screen. After about a solid two hours of cleaning and I finally had a clean phone but for being renewed premium that‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. No scratches obvious on the screen of the second phone and generally happy with the performance but the arrival appearance probably would have made me ship it back again if I was not stubborn to the core. It‚Äôs like Amazon wanted me to return both and go to Apple and to buy a brand new phone (which was the next step if I couldn‚Äôt get the screen clean on the second one)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se entreg√≥ en muy buenas condiciones, con muy leves se√±ales de uso. Lo √∫nico en contra es que al parecer la pantalla que le cambiaron no es original, ya que en las configuraciones del dispositivo me lanza una alerta dici√©ndome que la pantalla no es original o no est√° bien instalada, por lo dem√°s el dispositivo fue entregado como se anuncia."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 I bought this phone refurbished, but it came in good condition. Maybe one small scratch, but other than that, it was clean and well maintained. However, soon after I booted it up and transferred all my information and such, I got an alert that it couldn't be determined in the screen/display was a ""genuine Apple part."" I didn't think a lot of it, but the next day, my screen started flickering (orange/blue) and glitching. This has been happening for weeks now. There is hardly ever a second where the screen is on where it doesn't flicker orange. The only remedy is turning my brightness way down. Even that doesn't fix it because 1) I can't see the screen hardly and 2) I probably just can't SEE the flickering. Often, it'll get progressively more flicker-y until sometimes I see 'double' on the screen and it freezes. Like, I can't push any buttons or anything so I have I to turn it off and turn it back on. This doesn't actually fix the flickering but at least it un-freezes my phone (sometimes). This type of thing happens a minimum of 8 or so times a day. I suspect this is all to do with the alert about the display I got, but now I'm not sure because I no longer see the alert in settings.

Yes, I've tried restarting my phone. Yes, I've tried deleting apps that might be causing it to glitch. When I looked it up, I found that it may be due to some certain display settings being turned on, but I'm convinced it's not that. I'm pretty tech savvy and I've never seen this before.

Overall, it's a great phone, great camera etc. and worth your money. But, it's probably a better idea to buy new so you don't have to deal with any defective issues."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered the phone in the morning and it showed up at my house at 6pm! I was so surprised and happy.

I was kind of concerned with the reviews but the phone was such a good deal that I went for it anyway. It does have some very small scratches in the top right corner of the display like maybe some keys rubbed on it at some point in a bag - but when the screen is on you can‚Äôt see them at all. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this was a wonderful deal and the rest of the phone looks completely new. My battery is at 97% and has lasted for hours and hours. No issues there.

I guess my suggestion is that if you‚Äôre going to be nit picky about scratches or dents, don‚Äôt buy a used phone. I‚Äôm extremely happy for what I paid."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came earlier than expected, I was excited to get it, didn't want to go out of town without a phone, so when it arrived early, I was happy...until I took the phone to my carrier to put a new sim card in it, that's when the sim card was rejected because the phone was not unlock or fully unlocked.Also, the iPhone did not look like the iPhone 11 Pro Max I bought, it looks smaller and not the size of the actual phone in the picture, the was nothing in the unmarked box the phone was in to even indicate that it was actually an iPhone 11 Pro Max they sent me.Am very disappointed, cause now I still don't have a phone...but I also have to go out of town without a phone, I tried to request a quick replacement since am travelling in one day, but they refuse and stated that I have to return the phone, then they will give me a refund but not another phone...SMFH!! So, I got the phone today and return it today. Now am waiting for my refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect shape. The best experience buying refurbished phones, especially iPhones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered a renewed premium iPhone. Which I inspected in excellent condition as described but, the iPhone had many scratches around the edges.Phone is being returned"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I knew I was getting a renewed phone and couldn't expect a perfect phone but when it got here I noticed various scratches on the glass front screen and was wondering whether to return it or not. Fortunately nothing else was wrong with the phone, the camera lens was clean, the phone wasn't locked, the battery health was at around 95%. I decided to look for a glass screen protector and that solved the scratched screen as the new protector makes the scratches underneath not too noticeable. There have been no other problems since then and I am pleased with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn‚Äôt come in the apple box and no apple sticker but the phone came crispy and it only has one thing wrong with it but it‚Äôs cool"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I loveddddd this product!The price was great and I only found a few scratches on the bottom of the phone. They‚Äôre barely noticeable and can be covered by any case. Even with this, the phone was in almost brand new condition with 80% battery charge and a super clear screen! Super happy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is good, has great battery life and It arrived very fast. The only thing is that it has a few signs of wear. It‚Äôs not a big deal though."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs a pretty good phone. Great quality when it comes to aesthetics. Battery is great too. However I have been facing a couple of problems recently. One problem is that it tends to get hot when browsing the web. The other problem is network connectivity. The Wi-Fi and the cellular data randomly cuts out for a random period of time. Hopeful the last one was just some fluke because I haven‚Äôt experienced it again after the first few times."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything has worked well so far on this I-Phone (after downloading my info from I-cloud) ... except ...! A warning that the phone itself is displaying (I have attached an image) saying that it's unable to determine if the display is a genuine Apple part... ! I am afraid this will give me problems later on ...!Is anybody else having this problem?? Can anybody from this company give me customer support?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cracks on front, speaker doesn‚Äôt work right constantly hangs up and no one can hear you on it. I was surprised to see it didn‚Äôt work as expected I was hoping it would"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had this phone for over 6 months. There‚Äôs never been a problem with the phone. The only thing is that the iCloud storage is not sufficient and you will most likely have to pay for GB every month. It recognizes my face even in the dark. The battery lasts longer than a day if I‚Äôm not on it streaming. It charges really quickly. My phone hasn‚Äôt overheated at all. Although when it‚Äôs charging I don‚Äôt get on my phone. If connecting aux cord, you need adapter cause box doesn't come with one. Camera quality is good especially if you‚Äôre switching from android."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Woudl buy again. Love making payments."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôd recommend buying an Amazon Renewed phone and will buy one again in the future. It‚Äôs like a new phone! It‚Äôs much faster than my iPhone 8 Plus. I just won‚Äôt spend $1,099 on the newest phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max) from Apple and this is a great option to upgrade to a ‚Äúnew‚Äù phone! Plus, I bought the two year insurance on it in case something happens."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my iPhone 11 p r o max I was worried about buying a reconditioned iPhone like new well it is like new I bought it sold and shipped from Amazon very happy with it ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my review of the 512GB iPhone 11 Pro Max from Buyspry. I got this phone exactly 3 days ago.Your mileage may vary since these are refurbished phones however I did do some digging on this company and the seller had a great eBay reputation and no dings on BBB so I decided for this price and the Amazon backed 90 day money back, I had nothing to lose. I personally didn‚Äôt care if this phone came with a few scratches and nicks to the body, it would be going in a case anyway. The phone however arrived in a nice little box and procreated very well. The presentation was very decent. The phone was in immaculate condition and I couldn‚Äôt really find anything wrong aesthetically. The shipping did take a week but I‚Äôll chalk that up to amazons storehouse and the recent icy weather. During my 3 days of use I have noticed no abnormalities and everything functions great. If there is a downside it‚Äôs the battery life. It‚Äôs at 90%. Obviously I would want it to be at 100% but at this price I‚Äôll gladly take it. If you look at amazons refurbishing details it also lets you know that the battery‚Äôs are only guranteed to be over 80% life, so that is something to note, however battery‚Äôs aren‚Äôt too expensive and since this is an upgrade over my iPhone X even at 10% less battery life it still lasts several hours more easily. Overall I‚Äôm extremely pleased with my purchase and am so glad I got this for this price. Hope someone finds this info useful"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good aspect, signs of usage and 87% battery health"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my (like) new iPhone. I did a lot of research looking for the best deal and this was a pretty good. I‚Äôve had this phone for a few months now and haven‚Äôt had any problems. The battery life is great! I recommend this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery wasn‚Äôt replaced in service mode excellent cosmetic,but old battery"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in excellent condition. Would not recognize that it is renewed. No scratches. Nothing. Worth the dollars."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular funciona regularmente bien, el sensor de proximidad no estaba funcionando bien pero no era mayor problema‚Ä¶. La bater√≠a estaba consumida pero definitivamente creo es la mejor bater√≠a que hecho iPhone dura todoooo el d√≠a, no recomiendo celulares usados por ese precio deber√≠an costar menos ya que siempre viene con problemas los cuales result caro solucionarlos al menos en Ecuador"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone arrived quickly and it is as described. It looks to be in excellent condition other than the battery life. üôÇ"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was really excited about receiving this phone as it‚Äôs my first upgrade in 6 years. Everything from the condition of the phone to installation was great, until I checked the battery‚Äôs health and found out that it wasn‚Äôt a genuine Apple battery installed. On top of that, the phone became extremely hot as I was charging it. I‚Äôm giving this 2 stars because at least the phone arrived in pristine condition, which makes this even more disappointing. Minus 3 stars because of the aftermarket battery that was installed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone came earlier than I expected and with excellent working condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was somewhat nervous about buying a used iPhone, but could not justify the price of a new one. The 11 is the last major upgrade -- new chip, pro max, etc. Improvements to the later models are only incremental. So it was the perfect choice for me. I bought mine from Amazon because -- Amazon. And I opted for the renewed premium model. Mine came without a scratch anywhere and 90% on the battery. I am a happy camper."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone thinking it is a dual sim card as I had read to have a special sim card tray to hold two sim cards but what I got is BOT a dual dim mobile!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo el telefono esta exelente desbloqueado y trabaja bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Coming from an 11, my daughter wanted an upgrade and I convinced her to go for this 11 pro max and opt. for the higher storage (256gb). It was worth paying for the expedited shipping, the phone arrived in immaculate condition the battery health was EXCELLENT. Overall between the upgrade and almost new condition of the phone my daughter couldn‚Äôt be happier. She wanted the 13 pro max but at 1.5k at the time, this was a happy medium half the price and 256gb, lovely large screen. Overall EXCELLENT."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far this one is a very good phone. Everything looks good. It updated with no problem, battery health is ok 80% not to bad wont be long and I'll need a new battery. That is one o the down falls in buying a ""renewed"" phone. All and all not a bad deal, the seller is other problem!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this as a gift for my best friend. Her old phone was having major issues, and I was growing frustrated trying to converse with her. She lives in Hawaii, and I live in Oregon, so it is essential that we have a reliable means of communicating. Being an Android user, I had to do a bit of research. This was far and away the better reviewed of the Apple products. When she got the phone (and, according to her, the shock of her life), she was thrilled. The phone has been amazing for her on so many levels. Not only are our conversations FAR less problematic, but she has found the phone's features indispensable for her work during this Covid-19 situation. As a speech pathologist working for the school system, she is having to do much of her client work online. She said the new phone has saved her tons of time and effort lugging a laptop around. Also, she is enthralled with the functionality related to standard private usage. I keep realizing that our phones today are basically more functional computer systems than the first computer I bought back in the mid-eighties. So, all-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase. Plus, my friend owes me for life. So, there's that, too. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone must‚Äôve experienced water damage. Not loud. Can‚Äôt hear on the phone. Trying to get in contact with the seller to fix the issue‚Ä¶ [88% battery life] Still waiting on my refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone ear speaker is super quiet. Everything else works fine. Have tried everything to remedy and still not loud enough to have a conversation. Not happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update with 2nd purchase: 9/6/22These refurbished are more likely miss than hit. The second time around, the battery capacity is even lower, at 83%. The battery lost 1-2% while I was browsing the settings. It's an indicator that this battery is done as it's already in its 500th power cycle. Since these 11s are 3 year old now, I think it will be very hard to get one with more than 90% battery capacity. Unless you go for the premium refurbished. However, if someone goes that route, why not buy straight from Apple? Regular Refurbished (not Premium) here need to be at least $250 lower than Apple in order to be justified buying here. Again, I think the regular 80% battery capacity guaranteed is junk to begin with.1st Purchase:80% guaranteed really mean nothing because when the battery reached 80% capacity, it already toasted. Mine came with 87%. I bough it to replace the 7 Plus I bought brand new almost 6 years ago. The 7 Plus still has 85%. This 11 Pro Max is only 2 year old and only has 87%. Not really an improvement in term of battery life. Plus, at some point last year, it was damaged and the screen(s) got replaced. Yes, it is still within the terms set by Amazon for renewed products. However, if you got something like I did, you would have to spent a bit more to get the battery replaced and hoping that nothing else is wrong with the phone down the line. A couple years ago and before the premium renewed line, Amazon renewed was more of a sure thing. Now, it is a luck of draw. You may get something that was gently used or heavily used like mine. $600 for a heavily used phone, not worth it. May be better to spent a little more and get it straight from Apple (12 Pro Max for $200 more, came with brand new battery and shell, plus 1 year warranty same as brand new)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone says that the parts used to fix what I assume was a bad battery and a broken display screen are not genuine apple parts. It was a bit annoying for the first week or so because the notification wouldn‚Äôt clear and it seemed like every time I unlocked it it would take me to settings. Now it‚Äôs okay I just can‚Äôt see the battery health. I haven‚Äôt looked into how much it is going to be to fix this issue."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular lleg√≥ en buen estado f√≠sico, pero creo con algunos defectos m√≠nimos como el altavoz"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bateria al 94% de vida √∫til, sin uno solo rasgu√±o, parece nuevo, lo √∫nico que no me dej√≥ por completo feliz es el cargador con el que viene, no es original ellos son claros en eso, pero es de muy mala calidad por el precio que se paga y por ser Premium deber√≠an incluir un cargador de mejor calidad. Pero el tel√©fono espec√≠ficamente est√° perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was definitely a good purchase I 10/10 recommended was kind of Effie about it because it‚Äôs from Amazon but the battery life is awesome came charged and in very good condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Amazon you have to do better with verifying and certifying an apple product. You have to be so certain that this product is unlocked because it wasn‚Äôt unlocked when I received it and I had took the phone to verify it wasn‚Äôt going to be back log with anyone information. Turns out they had some information about who had this phone before I did but it was briefly in someone‚Äôs possession for those three days. So I wouldn‚Äôt really cold as a renewal product but more like a refurbish product. The iPhone does not come with its Apple box but with an after marketing box with and without the original iPhone wall charger. I decided not to use that wall charger and use my own wall chargers that have been certified by Apple. I don‚Äôt think the wall charger that comes with my device or with your device may be certified by Apple.

The storage is great to have especially for video creators like myself but the phone does perform very very well and I couldn‚Äôt complain too much about my experience dealing with Amazon and buying an Apple product open Amazon. So this should give you some insight on why you should go directly to the Apple store and buy an apple product from the Apple Store. Also you should take it to the Apple Store, to check for warranty options

Update: March 1st 2022
I have to make a shocking discovery about this device it turns out they replace the screen in the camera with third-party parts that are not certified by Apple. I took it to Apple to get a diagnostic and turns out the screen wasn‚Äôt even an apple screen. The reason why I had very suspicion about the device is how I received it. Also the screen was sometimes black out this is when I became very suspicious while playing a video game on the device. So I continue to ask Apple if they can replace the screen and they told me no. So I took it to a third-party Certified Applerepair shop that fixes iPhones correctly, not only a pay for a new screen but also paid for a new camera that was actually fixed on this device. I pretty much got scammed. I contacted Amazon and spoke to several people about this incident"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It would‚Äôve been a five star review but I got sent a broken charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect for the price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not complaining because I appreciate the phone being available at a decent price. However, I‚Äôm a little annoyed that the battery health is at 85%. I should have done a little more research before I made my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I live in Texas and this phone was in NY when we purchased it. It arrived to us the day after we purchased it. I was amazed at how fast this phone made it to my house! Thank you! The phone itself is in great condition but there‚Äôs ton‚Äôs of scratches on the front glass, so I‚Äôll be replacing the front glass but other than that, I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase! I was so nervous to by refurnished, but we will definitely go this route again. My phone stays charged at 100 percent, and everything was as the Seller said it would be. Thank you!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bout this phone from last year July and since then I‚Äôve had no problems, it‚Äôs just like buying a new phone without the same cost"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition pf the phone is great no deep scratches on the screen only small ones from light use battery came at 95% capacity 4 stars mainly because the charger and block that came with it are on the cheaper end but overall no complaints"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone with no issues. The only way I can even tell it‚Äôs been used is a very slight, about 1cm short scratch on the back. Battery life is excellent, camera is excellent, speakers and sound quality are great, it‚Äôs basically a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs what it says it is but I honestly thought for the price it would be better. The FaceID doesn‚Äôt work. I even updated to the latest os, which apple said should‚Äôve solved the issue, it didn‚Äôt. There are deep scratches in the surface which they hid rather well at first glance with this heavy, bulky screen protector that was also warped. Some minor scratches and dings on the sides/corners. That‚Äôs to be expected with a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù iPhone. Everything else works fine. The charging seems ok even though it was NOT at 80% when it arrived. It was at 30%. To summarize‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a roulette & It‚Äôs better than my shattered 8 plus."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone seemed like it came straight from apple and was new I choice normal Renee‚Äôs and got what seems like a premium renewed phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despite seeing so nasty reviews I decided why not I bought it with very low expectations upon receiving the device it was in surprisingly good condition only imperfection was a small hairline on the screen but its hardly visible storage is as requested and battery health is 91% phone has been working well since only one time the phone shut of unexpectedly but hasn‚Äôt done it since overall im satisfied"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in excellent condition. I‚Äôm so glad I went with the renewed premium and not regular renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone 11 Pro Max arrived one day early. Excellent condition. Set up was a breeze. Would definitely buy from again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really love the phone. No scratches and cracks. Face recognition 10/10. Battery life, not really what I expected (84%) but overall, one of my best cellphone purchases on Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm actually pretty shocked that for a refurbished phone that the quality is so good. Looks brand new besides a few very minor scratches. Giving 4 stars only because one of the speakers on the bottom don‚Äôt work but it‚Äôs not really the end of the world. All in all a pretty decent phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm loving the phone. Takes amazing photos. With 256GB storage I can store all my videos and photos without worrying about space! Love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything seems to be great. The only issue was it wasn't very clean. The upper speaker was filthy. But after a little cleaning all and all just like new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Well I have to say that I was worried about ordering a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone from Amazon. A third party seller nonetheless, I am extremely surprised at the amazing condition the phone came in. It showed up on time, packaged very well, No damage, charger and original box included, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The phone is working flawlessly soFar. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything to complain about. For Amazon shoppers that might as well be a miracle. O-M Wireless really went above and beyond my expectations. It came with a 91% capacity battery, It was sent with a very thick and durable screen protector. (Would recommend buying a thinner one for every day use) sent second day air, they had the color and carrier I wanted and it was a better price than I could find any where else. Not a single noticeable scratch or defect than can been seen with just my eyes. Pairs flawlessly, camera is good, set up with my carrier by simply switching SIM cards from my old phone to new one. Was done in 10 minutes."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I trusted Amazon as that is whom I purchased this iPhone from. It came with a warranty and the support that was needed was great! I am glad I made the choice to buy this way."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect, no scratches or anything. Just what I wanted!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was full of problems and a terrible disappointment initially. I debated returning it, then performed a factory reset and now have a wonderful phone at a greatly reduced price. Since this phone is used extensively in every way possible, I‚Äôm extremely grateful for such a good produce! Others even use my phone to take important pictures because the quality is so enhanced. The battery life is very good giving me at least 21 hours of use before needing a charge. Face recognition, the ability to swish type, and the speed of flipping through apps all contribute toward saving valuable time. In all, this was an excellent purchase at a much more reasonable price than what I‚Äôd have paid for the same phone brand new."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Jealous the price is lower now after spending 667 on this phone but I really needed an upgrade and love this phone so much. Has no dings, scratches, NOTHING!!!! Only thing is I had this phone for a week and already twice this phone will restart over and over again by itself sometimes."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No comment working great my sister love it üòç"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would of been very happy with this purchase if the camera worked. You could hear and feel the camera / microphone / vibration all tweaking. Battery was at 85% which is decent for a refurbished I phone and scree and case were in get shape."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone is the best iPhone that I ever owned, I love the Face ID it‚Äôs very fast and battery life is awesome since that this is my first ever iPhone that I bought from Amazon and it‚Äôs fantastic. I bought the renewed premium that says 90% or higher mine came with 99% battery heath and no scratches on the screen the is like brand new out of the box I would definitely recommend buying a iPhone on Amazon well worth it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased an Renew Premium iPhone 11 Pro Max 256gb, and unfortunately it did not come with the promised 90% battery capacity. I contacted customer service and they made everything right. They gave me two options, one to return the device, and the other to be partially refunded since the device did not meet the requirements for being premium renewed. I kept the device and accepted the refund, and I‚Äôm glad I did. Everything else about the phone is amazing, and I‚Äôm very happy with it! Awesome customer service! This is the 3rd device I‚Äôve ordered, and I would recommend this option to anyone looking to save some money while still getting a great phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery Life Is At 87% So It Dies Faster Than My Family Members Phones. Basically Doesn‚Äôt Last As Long As It Should. Regardless Great Unlocked Phone in Really Good Condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve bought 3 of the midnight green versions and have not been disappointed, especially for the price, i must recommend. If you‚Äôre having services issues just go to your carrier and they will get it straight. I had to take all 3 to my provider, even though they are unlocked, very quick and easy. You won‚Äôt find a better deal than this, and i can confirm they work on overseas carriers once you pop that SIM card in. Pull the trigger on this while you can!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone in excellent condition like new. So far everything works fine and updated. Great purchase for price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect renewed phone came with no stratches or scuffs functions properly and came with a good charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have been using it for about 1 month now and the phone looks and works like a brand new phone. However, i do have this small issue where at random times the wifi doesnt work. Its not a huge issue because its very rear ( maybe once a week) and it only goes down for a few seconds. I have tried on other wifi access points all over the city and my neighborhood and i have experienced this on some of them as well so i know its not my wifi. I have my other phone with me and it never goes down.But other than that, i am happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs always a skeptical decision to buy refurbished anything but this was an amazing product and I could not find a single fault with the cosmetics of the phone.When I got the phone I had to factory reset it as it was not done. Upon turning the phone on I didn‚Äôt even have to go through the setup mode and someone else‚Äôs iCloud was attached to the phone. That was worrisome at first but a simple factory reset solved that problem.I would recommend this phone.Be sure to ship it to the right address because the shipper will not change anything once the package is shipped. They put restrictions on the package where nothing could be changed and honestly if it weren‚Äôt for the FedEx delivered I would‚Äôve had to wait for it to return to the shipper and get a refund. The FedEx driver realized I had moved and left the package at my new address."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It have a small chip but it was really hard to spot in normal conditions and everything else was working perfectly. It was overall a great deal."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got this phone it would not turn it‚Äôll turn back on every second and make phone hot I had to figure it how to turn it off and the battery life it‚Äôs not good but it‚Äôs also not bad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall Phone works well, no 5g like my Samsung A71, Wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt maintain strong connection like my A71 at same distance from router.Cosmetics of the phone- arrived with a screen protector pre-installed, when I removed it I found a deep scratch and permanent scuff on the glass. Back of phone shows wear from previous owners case especially around cameras and the camera rings have some scratches and a couple deep grooved nicks. Overall not exactly ‚Äúlike new‚Äù as promised by Amazon renew physical description‚Ä¶probably will return"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got this phone when my old one crapped out. It is only a couple of generations old and the price is excellent. The phone is like brand new. The battery life is excellent. Face ID works great. Great screen! All in all it is a great phone! I have no regrets whatsoever about buying it! I love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno, Justo por el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelent condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came with a noticeable scratch on the screen but everything else is fine its still beautiful but I probably would recommend getting renewed premium üò¨"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","this phone is open to all carriers which was wonderful. Fully unlocked and easy to set up! I was afraid to order at first but I'm glad I did. Oh and its a real apple phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno sin problemas como nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La bater√≠a es mala, dura muy poco, por lo dem√°s todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When they sell on Amazon renew products they should look into it closely, so I purchased this iPhone from a seller named BUYSPRY and the phone did look good it didn't have scratches or blemishes on the edges or on the back of the phone but there was a tempered glass covering the front screen when I remove the temper glass there were light blemishes and fine hairline scratches on the screen surface it's not noticeable when you put on the tempered glass which I do on my phone to protect it from scratches but when you remove it it is noticeable so the product isn't really renew when there are scratches on the phone screen I would give it a b+. I think Amazon and their resellers need to evaluate and understand when using the term renewed and refurbished because this phone wasn't renewed it felt more like refurbished."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this phone was a good buy. It did have a one inch scratch at the top of the screen and battery capacity was at 94%. In my opinion all ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phones should come with a new battery. How can it be ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù if nothing has been done to it. This phone was basically half price so I am completely satisfied. I would definitely purchase again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a very beautiful iPhone. It looks brand new. Doesn‚Äôt have a single scratch. Came with a charging brick and cord. Fully unlocked. Downloaded information from my other phone perfectly.UPDATE: had to update. I still LOVE this phone. It‚Äôs beautiful and sleek and works perfect. The battery is strong. It never overheats. It never glitches. There was not one single scratch on it when I received it. It feels so beautiful in the hands. The thickness is beautiful and solid. It‚Äôs so much larger than the iPhone 11. It‚Äôs identically as beautiful as the new iPhone 12. This was a good purchase. I‚Äôm very happy with it. I was initially apprehensive about investing in an iPhone through amazon. It‚Äôs my first Amazon Phone purchase. I‚Äôm glad I took the leap. NEW UPDATE: STILL IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE. IT STILL WORKS PERFECT. NEVER GLITCHES OR OVERHEATS. IT‚ÄôS STILL SO BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. GREAT LEAP OF FAITH. I FEEL LIKE I GOT A BRAND NEW PHONE."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It so much thing wrong with this phone I HATE IT LIKE WHY????? Never ordering a phone off Amazon again ! üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I went from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I am absolutely in love with this phone. The camera is awesome and takes great pictures. Face recognition works great; it recognizes my face with my sunglasses on. The battery lasts longer than the iPhone 7 Plus."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","very god, but the screen like a little bad, touchscreen, but its god"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max offers rock solid WiFi performance and reliable cell service in weak signal areas, unlike the reconditioned iPhone XS Max that it replaced. After my other seller's tech support staff exhausted all possible solutions for the older phone's performance issues, I decided to return that phone and upgrade to the 11 Pro Max.Not certain whether my previous phone's problems had been caused by the XS Max itself or by some combination of the apps I had installed, I took a chance and set my new phone up from a back up of the previous phone. The difference was immediately obvious; in an area where the XS Max showed one bar of signal strength on a good day and no signal most of the time, I now have two and sometimes three bars with no dropped calls. WiFi reliability has shown a similar degree of improvement.Returning the XS Max and spending the extra money for this iPhone 11 Pro Max has been one of the best decisions I've made. Even better yet, this reconditioned 11 Pro Max looks like a brand new phone, with no visible scratches, and retains 100% of its battery capacity.In short, I'm a very happy customer!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I even opened the box, it was making noise like something was playing.. it was on an auto voice thing where it would read everything on the screen.. after I get it all set up and everything it is perfect. Almost no signs of wear.. screen protector on it is perfect. Battery life is good and there is nothing wrong with it. I am glad I took the chance to buy this and it even came two days early. Very happy with this phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buena compra e inversi√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone in good condition and everything is working fine, but the price is too much, and when I returned it to Amazon they won't give me my money back until they receive the phone and I sent it 8 day's ago for $14 with ups but still delay, I'm in need for the money but I'm stuck with this stupid return policy Amazon have, iphone 11 pro max 512g for $847 sum change while u can get it for 600 sum change!!?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is perfect ü•∞"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mine had scratches on it and battery wouldn‚Äôt last long then I found out that I couldn‚Äôt talk on the speaker phone for calls. People would complain that they couldn‚Äôt hear me. Only way it worked was if I had it against my ear. Then the face recondition took a while. It says that it should come in a almost new condition but with problems like that and the money I spend it shouldn‚Äôt be like that"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Iphone like brand new. Battery 95%, no scratches or damage's. Charger not original but new and works well. The only sad thing is the key to remove sim card wasn‚Äôt came in the box. But i recomend buy Renewed Premium. It worth the money spent."

I've had it close to a month now and so far so good. I was a little skeptical about ordering after reading the few negative comments concerning issues activating phone with Sprint, however, those comments are prior to T-Mobile merge. I experienced no issues whatsoever activating phone. I upgraded from 6S Plus, so just had to get use to some feature changes (i.e. taking screenshots). Overall, excellent buy!!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works and easy to get connected to my own service. No problems at all with my phone and I have never had a problem buying phones on Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery health is inferior to a normal iPhone 11 Pro Max. This phone 1-2 hours to charge, and has a very low active usage life (4-5 hours screen time). This phone‚Äôs unauthentic apple battery is subpar at best."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is like a brand new phone. No scratches or defects at all. I genuinely appreciate the way they boxed it up. It was like opening a new phone. Battery life is phenomenal. Really guys you would never know this was refurbished."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","However the add stated it would be above 80% they should replace the battery if it‚Äôs in the lower 80s just because these are supposed to be renewed not used heavily"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I prefer my iPhone 6. When I do a search using iPhone 11 Pro Max the results return in small print, many times query doesn‚Äôt return results at all. I am glad I kept my iPhone 6 so that I can use it for back up to search and read pages the iPhone 11 Pro Max doesn‚Äôt seem to respond to. Same search but either wrong results or no response. Also, some pages are blocked so I have to use my iPhone 6 to get results. Setting seem ok but for some reason the iPhone 11 Pro Max performs below par."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received my refurbished iPhone 11 Pro Max and the phone came flawless.. I was nervous about buying a refurbished phone off Amazon but definitely met my expectations and more.. it looks brand new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered 2 phones one for me and one for my son. Neither one of us have had any problems. Phones showed up in perfect shape and we had no problems activating them. We are with straight talk. Would definitely order from this seller again Came with phone , charger and, sd card remover"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I personally was really scared spending this much money on the phone especially after purchasing it and going on here to read comments. Stressed me out for a few days waiting for the phone because a lot of negative reviews but so far so so good. I have had the phone for 2 months now and works perfectly fine do not let the comments fool you i will recommend this to anyone to get if needing a phone the vendor is fine and delivery was smooth got here quick and battery life is perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Yo lo compr√© para cambiar de tel√©fonos y para tener uno mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy a renewed phone due to some reviews here, but I decided to give it a try and I‚Äôm happy I did.The phone is in good condition, no cosmetic damage and battery is just as described: 85%, so it lasts on me a day with low usage (two if I‚Äôm at home), but I need to charge it during the day if I‚Äôm using extensively. Overall I‚Äôm really happy for this."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The delivery was very quick. It looks great and so far works very well. I would order from this supplier any time and recommend him. Many thanks..I. Marlow"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ completo y muy n√≠tido. Volver√≠a a comprar a BuySpry.. compre en otra tienda y no llego completo.. BuySpry lo mejor.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone didn‚Äôt even seem refurbished seems brand new heck I‚Äôm even using it while typing this lol there were no scratches on screen, battery health was at 100 even after it recalibrated from more usage, and it came within a timely matter I think a day early if I‚Äôm not mistaken"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ok good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought this iPhone 11 Pro Max to replace my broken iPhone XS Max. Received the phone in 2 days and was pleased upon opening the package to find the phone in mind condition! Battery was at 82% which was not so great, but was willing to overlook it as the phone was in excellent condition with not a single scratch or dent. However, when I went to my phone carrier to set up my new phone, I was told they could not activate it! Apparently the phone was not a clean IEM and could not be activated. My carrier even made several phone calls but to no avail! Phone could not be activated and basically was a dead paper weight!I was very unhappy because of my wasted time and money! Then it I had to sent it back to Amazon for a refund and it took over 2 weeks to get my money refunded! Do not waste your time and effort on a Amazon renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max. I should have listened to the many bad reviews for this phone but I was willing to take a chance and unfortunately got a bad deal!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is decent for 615 when I got it on sale. Now it went back up to 663. Description says no defects when viewed at arms length. Yeah, if you're Helen Keller. It's a few scratches and at various areas on the screen. However it is superficial and isn't deep grooves and hides well under a screen protector. But the screen protector provided is cheap, the sides doesn't stick as you can see in the pic. I don't want to return it, risk getting another scratched up one for the higher price. Plus the back and camera is pristine, guess the previous owner kept it in a case. Also the battery is at 97% health so for 615 plus 5 bucks for a case and screen protector to hide the superficial srcratches...it's a decent buy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice picture"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery life is why it love it.Also all the updated items.Great phone!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","1st experience with an Amazon renewed product. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Looks and functions as brand new!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Working perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Product was a gift. Recipient is happy with gift"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall good physical condition. Some dirt build up at speakers and earpiece. I was expecting battery to be new or better than 80% of the original capacity. Came with screen protector, not sure if it is to hide scratches on actual screen or just as an extra. Have not taken it out yet."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono est√©ticamente est√° bien solo unos rasgu√±os en la pantalla, el cargador no funcion√≥ por eso es que le doy baja calificaci√≥n pienso que por el precio pudo haber estado mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works great, face recognition works wonderfully, battery life lasts me all day sometimes have to charge it once during the day, storage capacity is perfect I have space for all my pictures and applications with tons of space leftover"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todas las funciones tal cual un equipo nuevo, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 86% teniendo en b cuenta el tipo de equipo est√°s comprando a√∫n le queda una vida √∫til de a√±os !!! No me arrepiento de esta compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came good just that it had scratches on the screen"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This product came with only three small scratches. The battery life was only at 85 percent, so not that great, but still a great product and delivery."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn‚Äôt like some part of my camera front camera photos came out distorted like it wasn‚Äôt 12megapixel in front, had to compare with other peoples phones to know mine had some issue apart from that everything was okay"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the iphone 11 pro max in gold and it is in very good condition. works really well. everything is fine just has a few minor scratches on the screen which is bearable but would receive a 5/5 if they weren‚Äôt there. i also ordered the iphone 11 pro in gold with the same feature (256 gb) and it had no scratches at all. so compared to this phone, the physical condition is better on the 11 pro. other than the small minor scratches, everything works well as if i just bought it at an apple store!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It works as expected, arrived timely. NowI purchased a cover for it, added a finger holder, so it‚Äôs perfectUse it every day for a phone, texting, social media, brain games and learning."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","my first time buying an iPhone from Amazon, at first I felt a little skeptical because what if the phone comes out to be scratchy/ battery condition is bad and etc. but when I got the packaged phone works well, the battery health was at 93% which was fine for me because the description said it will be 80% and above. It came with a charger as well, I've been reading about these reviews here saying the charger is not the original one from apple, hello read caption/ product first before buying. they gave me everything that they stated in the bio. PHONE WORKS WELL AND WORKS AS BRAND NEW FROM APPLE STORE!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS PRICE ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS 256GB.. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. :)) THANK YOU!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve only had it for 3 days so this review might be a little premature, but so far so good. My review is only about the phone itself because the packaging is not the original and the charger is aftermarket, but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was really good for this phone. Face recognition and the actual appearance of the phone are 5 stars, no dents or scratches absolutely nowhere on the screen or bezel, I am using ultra mobile so I went for the Tmobile phone since they‚Äôre the same network and it worked just fine as soon as I introduced the sim card, no icloud issues whatsoever which has happened before on other iphones from other sellers. I‚Äôm gonna give you guys 4.5 stars just for the mere reason of the packaging and the charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product that came as described. Only minor issues: battery life is 87% and there is a small scratch on the screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ bien se ve algo bien ya se ve su uso excesivo con bater√≠a en un 89% creo ya muy usado para que valga m√°s de 700$ pero funciona perfecto hoy lo active a la l√≠nea todo bien lo malo que no haga realidad la cuenta de la Apple store intente hacer una nueva con mi otro correo electr√≥nico de igual forma no agarra el c√≥digo de seguridad.. Si no puedo hacer la cuenta de la tienda de Apple tendr√© que regresarlo y espero que a si como toman el dinero a si sea de vuelto a mi cuenta Gracias üò°"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Incredible deal! Came with 100 percent battery life! This iPhone takes several holes to even drain down from 90% let alone when it‚Äôs still rocking on 1% all night! Got a 30 watt charger to go with it, it seems it draws between 18 and 22 watts? So the 30watts is extra headroom versus the 18watt max from Apple. This refurbished unit came with a third party charger and cables as expected. It is indeed the right color and storage capacity. Flawless, not a single scratch and a clean imei. The size is perfect, about the same, but a little wider than the Galaxy Note9 I upgraded from. Thank you BuySPRY for the perfect iPhone‚Äôs! My device shipped with 13.4.1 and didn‚Äôt force me to upgrade while setting up so I was able to cough cough run some stuff on it if you know what I mean ;)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks and works great"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I felt so ripped off but it‚Äôs is what it‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not the type of person to judge a product of some bad reviews but I should have stuck by it and not purchase the phone cause what is this, should have know better cause the phone came on 1% smh"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No ear volume great testing. Now it‚Äôs call apple we will send another if they ok it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Screen was lifted on edges and would not respond to touch well. Had to tap several times to get it to work."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba algo preocupada x q no sab√≠a en q condiciones llegar√≠a el iPhone 11 Pro Max, pero me siento muy feliz, llego en perfecta condiciones f√≠sica y de funcionamiento, ni un solo rasgu√±o, aparte llego dos d√≠as antes de lo programado, realmente me siento muy satisfecha con el producto y la oportunidad"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was packaged good and with care. I asked for a space grey 64gb, but gave me a 256gb midnight green.Which is way better. Came with a 90 percent battery which meets. Everything works it perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Shipping was exceptionally quick, I bought this phone for my dad‚Äôs birthday at the last minute and it arrived the night before. My dad upgraded from a 6 Plus to this phone and he loves it. Works just like a brand new phone and all of his information transferred over seamlessly."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got the Amazon Premium refurb, but hopefully I won‚Äôt need to use it, and it may seem like I won‚Äôt need to"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The negative comments almost put me off but this phone is literally amazing so if you‚Äôre thinking of doing it please do it. Could be a hit or miss but you might hit so do it. Literally NO scratches or cracks. Nothing"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was pretty nervous to spend this much for a phone that was refurbished (technically) but I am so glad I did! It came in on time, all packed up nice and neat. It was charged and only had one little scratch on the top left camera frame (the silver ring around the actual lens, therefore doesn‚Äôt affect camera at all). Everything works great, speakers sound amazing, camera is the absolute best quality, and the battery can last me all day if I forgot to put it on charge the night before. It came in exactly as described and I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I also bought a glass screen protector and spiegen case for the best protection."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased this certified renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max 256GB to replace my old iPhone 7 because I didn't want to buy iPhone 12 Pro with 5G technology that is still developing yet. Received this phone with a few minor scratches around the rim and the scratch on the screen is not noticeable after putting screen protector. Battery capacity is 100%!! I have been testing a lot of functions (playing video game, watching YouTube video, FaceTime with families overseas, virtual office meeting via zoom and MS team, pairing with Apple Watch etc.), no freeze or any issues so far. The battery lost only 4% yesterday morning when pairing with Apple Watch (with bluetooth on) and joining virtual office meeting via zoom. It is amazing! OVERALL, IT IS A GREAT RENEWED PHONE with the price paid!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The hook of Amazon Renewal was to buy a used product that looks and functions like new. At a lower price and save the planet at the same time. Nice marketing I fell for it. Twice! I bought a iPhone 11 ProMax from BuySpry. The first phone had a single deep scratch on the bottom left. It also had metal damage on the bottom left from it being dropped by previous owner. There were also numerous very visible scratches all over the screen. How very disappointing for a phone that was marketed as ‚Äòrenewed‚Äô and called Grade A refurb. Okay. Chalk it up to lemon. I returned it. And ordered another. Bad omen. The second phone box was used. The seal was broken and clearly I just got someone‚Äôs return. WTH. The second one was slightly less bad but not acceptable. . It had a actual chip in the LCD screen along with several noticeable scratches. Wow. This was not renewed to like new and not grade A as pitched. I returned this one as well. The bad I already told you. The good. The first phone had 100% battery health so clearly it was replaced. Don‚Äôt know about the second phone. Seeing a chip in the lcd. I didn‚Äôt even bother to power it up. I returned it the same day in disappointment. Both phones had screen protectors. I think to hide the scratches more than as protection for the second user if I may be cynical. Perhaps I got two bad phones and I am the exception. Perhaps it‚Äôs the seller BuySpry. And other companies do a better job? I do not know but I don‚Äôt think I will be going to fall for Amazon used marketing for a long while."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got what would seem to be a brand new phone. 11max pro. Full battery. Perfect all the way around. Sweet."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","What I loved about this phone ultimately is that it came in as if I purchased it brand new. This phone had no problems with scratches, bumps, or any problems with lagging.However, the one downside to this phone was the battery. The battery dies starts to drain within hours, and I need to charge it in the middle of the day. It just does not last long for the day.But overall, great quality of the camera, lots of storage, and I enjoy it overall."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was meant to be a Christmas present. First phone didn‚Äôt arrive, second was wrapped as a present. Receiver spent time loading the older phone backup just to realize the phone speaker wasn‚Äôt working. The sound was almost inaudible and very fainted (even when increasing the volume all the way up). Useless if you want to hear the phone ringing, or map directions in the car. I had to return it and order another one directly from Apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Every thing perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone a couple of months ago and it came with the screen protector and I was like that's cool. Recently, while replacing the screen guard I peel off the old one and saw that my phone screen is full of scratches and those are deep scratches and not just normal scratches. It's like somebody has must have been rigged the phone on concrete, but the smart a** seller has already put on a new screen guard to fool the customers like me. This is really a huge disappointment. It's been a more than 3 months now so I can't return it and these phones are expensive, so we are under the impression that it must be a nice product."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this is a good phone for the price they want buttt the phone did come with some scratches on it but i‚Äôm in IT tech and fixed it already but beware when ordering!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Kiss electronics NYC sent an iphone 11 pro max with a busted top speaker. Not satisfied at all. I see that they are permanently closed now so im assuming they have also sent bad products to plenty of others.üëéüëé"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers are messed up,otherwise good phone,I need someone to contact me on this"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was is great condition but for some reason it will not pair with any car radio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente celular! Muy recomendable! No tiene da√±os ni rayas! Funciona todo correctamente y vino con 93% de bater√≠a! Excelente como nuevo!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I can count the amount of reviews that I‚Äôve done. But this deserves the best review that I can post. First of all, the phone came a day early, that‚Äôs a plus up 100 for me, second, the phone came in perfect condition, no scratches, or dents whatsoever and that‚Äôs a plus 1,000. Third, the phone is compatible with my SIM card. If you‚Äôre reluctant about buying from this seller, I‚Äôll tell you that you can trust them. And the price for the condition of the phone that I received is heaven sent. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and I‚Äôm not disappointed at ALL. Thank you very much ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is fine, it's an iPhone 11 pro max as described. No noticeable defects. Curious why the refurb market is flooded with this model in this color?DOES NOT WORK ON SPRINT AS IS CLEARLY CLAIMED IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE DESCRIPTION."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is great except I can only use the speaker phone to be able to hear the other person on the call."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo OK pero la bater√≠a tiene 83% es muy poco para que lo vendan al precio que no compre"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Capacity not right"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a great deal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this for my father and he loved it. No issues at all and it has very tiny cosmetic scratch on top right of the screen. The reason why I purchased for size and storage capacity and considering to get myself one too"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I upgraded from a Iphone 8 plus to the 11 pro max and I can't not stress enough how great this phone is the battery life is so great feels like you can use the phone all day and it won't die. The display is so awesome you can really tell the difference with the oled display on the 11 compared to the 8 plus all the dark blacks look amazing. The camera quality is out of this world with the three cameras it feels like you can record movie quality videos and take stunning pictures as well. 10/10 would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy it. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition is pristine. Works well and came with 100% battery life. Very satisfied customer."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life good, face recognition good, camera lenses did fall off 3 days after I got it, connected with metro they think it was a fake iPhone with different screen and camera and flash. Did not come in original box."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs a B+ Rated phone but extremely clean! I‚Äôm impressed. Battery health is 92%."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came in great condition, the screen nor cameras have any scratches visible, but there are minor scratches along the corners and such. The phone is fast and has given me no problems so far, but I will update if need be. I would recommend to buy it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I saw that it was a refurbished phone I was a little hesitant. I have bought refurbished items before but this one is really great. The battery has a 91 percent and the unit itself looks really brand new. No scratches, no broken screen or anything else. It was refurbished by Verizon so I guess they know what they are doing. If you are thinking about a refurbished item then I recommend that you go ahead and buy it. I did and it worked out GREAT!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cuando me lleg√≥ el tel√©fono hace un mes ten√≠a un 96% en la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a , ahora tengo 92%, no s√© si es normal que haya disminuido tanto en ese lapso de tiempo. Algo que he notado es que no me llegan las notificaciones siempre, a veces si, a veces no."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase 2 of these and weeks later was on sale for over $100.00 less. Have many dents and cracks. functions ok. have many scratches and sometimes the screen freezes, I wish I can return and purchase a different one. I will not recommend it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came in a day early, was not scratched, and works great!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal and business"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price phone quality is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","everything was perfect came with a new charger ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had hella issues upon buying this phone. For one, the people who sell it are not certified to have Apple screens so I had MAJOR screen issues. My screen was even coming out by the second week of having the phone. I contacted them and they were willing to fix it but since they did not have Apple products. I decided not to send it back.. I would‚Äôve sent it back but that would‚Äôve cost me too much time. So I got it fixed at my job and now it works fine."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS SUPER SCARED OF BUYING MY IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS GOING OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR A WHILE, RIGHT AFTER BUYING IT AND JUST INCASE IT HAD AN ISSUE, I WOULD BE SCREWED. I WAS ALSO SCARED THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE TRULY UNLOCKED... HOW WRONG WAS I!!!THE PHONE IS AMAZING!! TOTALLY UNLOCKED!! LOOKS AS GOOD AS NEW! NO SCRATCHES... NO MARKS! TOTALLY BRAND NEW! NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL... I MEAN, AT ALL!! BATTERY LEVELS... ALSO PERFECT!WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE. CAN'T WAIT TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE FROM THEM."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic phone despite it has a minor imperfection on the screen. But the phone itself is fully functional. I give 4.5 out of 5 to the seller due to seller not disclosing the imperfection on the screen.This iphone 11's camera is by far worse than Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. The color is indeed not as good as Samsung. If you plan to take professional photos and videos, this iPhone is not a right choice. I am not advertising for any company, but as a professional studio, I give a fair judgement and honest opinion about Apple and Samsung."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price! Excellent condition!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! I was a bit skeptical to buy a phone online, but this Amazon refurbished iPhone is amazing. Not only is it in mint condition, but the battery life was still 96%!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the size and face recognition. I miss having the control button on the front and the battery life percentage shown, I don‚Äôt like that."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had ordered another 11 pro max from a different supplier but I had to return it cuz it wasn't working right but this one is great so far."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","love it! it‚Äôs in perfect condition for me, battery could be a little better but 95% battery health is better than less than that. I was able to set it up the same day and absolutely no issue. the condition is immaculate despite the small scuffs around the border of the device that cannot be visible with a case. everything so far is perfect- lets just hope that this one doesn‚Äôt break so fast :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this seller. I have purchased 4 phones from this seller in the last two years for me and my children. The phones come brand new to be renewed. The battery is like new with 100% battery life and the phones are packaged like brand new. hey quality is as if you walked into the apple store and bought them. Worth every penny. They also operate as if they are brand new and work like butter. I love this seller. will remain a lifetime customer."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Device was pretty much new other than a few scratches on the sides of the frame. Other than that, no scratches on the screen and everything works perfectly!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Typing is difficult and frustrating as nearby characters are engaged instead of the ones needed. Care is needed to avoid sending incomplete text when typing close to the right hand side of the screen! I still like my phone and I will buy again or recommend to others."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This vendor was very prompt with responding to enquiries. The product is also outstanding. I will buy it again for sure. thanks!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our daughter bought this phone and had it less then a month. She purchased screen protectors and a case for it. She is a single parent and needed a new phone. During these times of unrest, in every way imaginable, people tend to do things they normally wouldn't do. In this case, she spent almost a thousand dollars on this IPhone 11 ProMax!! And she didn't purchase the $199 warranty figuring with the price she paid, the phone's endurance would be great. Now the saying goes-""you get what you pay for."" Well, she was entertaining her young child outside. This very expensive phone fell a short way to the ground and landed on a smaller then pea sized rock!! The bottom right side now has a small shattered hole and that part does not work. I contacted this company asking if there was any way they would help her get it fixed-pay for the screen replacement repair, send a replacement screen etc.. They were unsympathetic. Advised her to find a repair shop and have it fixed. Well, I understand there is no warranty under the circumstances, but to get a small amount of help??? We normally buy Samsung phones. We have purchased LGs. Both these brands are more durable and less money then the IPhone. I have accidentally dropped mine-LG-a few times and have had no damage done.All in all-you don't always get what you pay for. This IPhone is heavy and fragile. The customer service is unsympathetic.IPhones are nothing more then a status symbol and my daughter now regrets her purchase.Like I said, during these times of unrest, a little sympathy and help would have been appreciated."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had it for a couple of days, but its been really good. It came in really good condition, no noticeable scratches on screen or back or edges. So far happy with the phone."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had two choices, renewed or premium renewed. Went with the premium renewed for a little extra cost for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and was surprised the phone looked almost brand new. Not disappointed in the purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is great, my wife loves it and wud not trade it for nothing."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Usually people buying these products are kind of skeptical about them and they don‚Äôt know if they will receive the full product, let alone the product being in great shape. I recently ordered this product but at first I thought it was a scam seeing the reviews so I tried to cancel my order but it was already shipped so I went with it. It arrived a few days early and it was more than I expected! Phone is in perfect condition and it came with a charger and a cable though not the original products but it still came with the phone and the phone had a screen protector added which is nice on top of 90day warranty only case anything goes wrong. Great service! (Fully unlocked, tried my current SIM card and it works!)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had my phone now for a little over 2 weeks. Cosmetically, it looked brand new. I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","For those who don't know what unlocked means, it doesn't mean it is for the verizon network. Very frustrating. I thought unlocked meant it was a legit, not stolen, phone. I guess it means that, but then it doesn't mean you can go to verizon. So the phone itself was fine and the seller was great because he took it right back, but I just don't know where you can connect it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything on this product. It works fast, and speedy. Connected to my old phone easily, and can‚Äôt wait to start using it. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to buy it. It comes with screen protector in the package and charger, with a booklet in case you wants to return the product. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíùüòãüòá‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üíù"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall the phone is good, the speak isn‚Äôt that good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I read some reviews before buying this iPhone saying that some screens were broken and scratched. My iPhone Pro Max came in a box wrapped in a bubble mailer. There was instructions for phone replacement if needed amd came with a generic cord and outlet adapter box. The phone itself was is great condition and was completely unlocked. It worked and so did the charging cord. The IPhone charged quite fast and has a reliable battery. It's not very thick, but is quite heavier than the phone I was previously using. I am personally not bothered by the weight. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is quick to respond and easy to use!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my fourth Amazon Renewed product I've purchased, and my second phone. As with the other items, this iPhone 11 Pro Max looks and works like new. The battery shows 98% health, and was shipped with a new (non original) 2.4A charger, and 3ft lightning cord. A glass screen protector came pre installed as well. My phone arrived 2 days early which was very much appreciated. I have checked all features of the phone, and everything seems to be in good working order. I feel confident ordering with Amazon's 90 day satisfaction guarantee."

Just wish the battery was at 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great deal and phone was great. Get it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenia un peque√±o rayon en la camara trasera y residuos de pegamento a los lados. El cargador era tipo USB . Al momento funcionando bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got my phone I loved it. It worked perfectly. Now, 3 months later, my apps keep closing randomly. I‚Äôm not saying that is because of the phone, it could be something else but I have no way of knowing. All in all, I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase and would buy again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything about it at first THE SPEAKER IS KINDA BROKEN it words but it sounds harsh and it was difficult cause for some reason it said the phone wasn‚Äôt unlocked but I took it to my carrier store and it was all better it‚Äôs a good value for you money"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm always leery of making large purchases of goods that are sight unseen, but took a chance on this phone. It arrived in nearly pristine condition. Very clean, with a minute scratch on the screen (the screen protector I put on makes it invisible). Battery life at 95%. Completely unlocked, so no issues with activating and setting it up. I purchased it from the refurbished Verizon seller. Delivery requires a signature (to avoid potential loss or theft), so make sure someone is home to receive it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","excellent service and excellent product. like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen has some sort of distortion on it and the camera has some deformities, it is jumping and it is making a weird sound when I try to use the rear camera"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly I thought it was going to come I‚Äôm broke but no everything was perfect the only thing wrong is that it came with a scratch but that‚Äôs it only one scrath"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After not being able to remove the SIM card tray and getting approved to return it, my son in law was able to remove it. He placed my SIM card in it, charged it and it charged quickly with the battery running at 87%. I have gone a whole day without having to put it on the charger. I am extremely happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent phone so far o issues. I wish for the high tag price a manual of basic features would have been included, I had to learn te hard way but I Did!
Only one issue a black tab bar like appears on the bottom and middle f the phone some times mostly when navigating the web. But that‚Äôs a programming flaw. The phone was in new like condition no scratches or defective. I am satisfied with the purchase, was expensive but worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far so good. Just not the color I ordered. I ordered green, but got white. But whatever there‚Äôs a case on it anyway."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy satisfecho por la compra, lleg√≥ en buen estado con una vida √∫til de bater√≠a de 92%, lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is heavy. It‚Äôs thick. I like it. Only thing I have a problem with is the back camera and flash light. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work and they knew it before sending it to me. Now I have to pay to get it fixed. Great phone just get it from Apple"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo est√° muy bien hasta ahorita no
he tenido ning√∫n problema"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works great and only had a few scratches around the camera."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone esta perfecto, tiene pocos detalles pero para su precio yo creo que vali√≥ la pena, estoy muy contento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has held up great. Forgot how big iPhones are better for me. Have a case and screen protector and alls good in the hood. Micro scratches on screen, but it‚Äôs used, only notice them when I HUNT for them."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had to dig lint/dirt out of the charging port with a paperclip so the cable would fit properly, but otherwise seems fine so far. Got the phone with 90% battery health. Amazon needs to check the cleanliness of that port before shipping phones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week Friday and I received it today the 2nd of December which was extra fast. The battery life is 100% which is amazing and the phone came in a really good condition. I love love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buyspry has excellent customer service and quality phones you‚Äôd swear my iPhone pro max was new! They ship with a screen protector already on . When I look for a refurbished phone again I‚Äôm going to make sure it‚Äôs buyspry as the vendor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm so glad I chose this for my upgrade! My old phone was a 6s plus and the battery on that was pretty much nonexistent. I was constantly charging but now I just charge once and I‚Äôm good to go literally all day! At first I was VERY hesitant to spend this much money, but I‚Äôm so glad I did! Great battery life, lots of storage space and it‚Äôs just an all around great phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase this one because it looks like an iPhone 13 pro but costs less."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love the pictures"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice iPhone, works good and has a nice amount of battery life. Very impressed, highly recommended. Face ID works very good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max works like new! The screen is fantastic (and even came with a complimentary screen protector!). My only qualm is that there are several (I believe I counted close to 7-8) nicks in the casing around the edges of the phone. Not terrible... and, certainly not enough for me to send back! It's used, so it's definitely to be expected... I'll hopefully get 2-3 more years out of this model!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is so perfect, it feels like a brand new one."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone I received Looks Brand New.
And came with 92% battery life‚Ä¶
Was incredibly worried because some of the comments"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 11 Pro Max has been working perfectly so far. The max. battery life is indeed 100%, and it lasts for about 2-3 days, depending on usage. The camera system is fantastic, and I love that there is a specific camera lens responsible for zooming in and out. The phone is fast, as it opens all of my apps and the web browser very quickly. Above all else, I love that the phone has plenty of storage capacity, probably more so than I will ever need. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is in need of one."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Solid choice for a new phone. It arrived quickly in mint condition. If you don‚Äôt want to be saddled with a contract, it‚Äôs very easy to set up as a prepaid att line. The only issue I‚Äôve had is with the charging cable. It‚Äôs not good. But I didn‚Äôt buy the phone for the cable, so that‚Äôs not really relevant to my thoughts on the product itself. Solid bargain all around."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my phone, but when I received it I didn‚Äôt check it thoroughly. If I use speaker phone, nobody can hear me. I just went to get it fixed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a very expensive iPhone refurbished and did not come with the straight talk SIM card, so cannot use the phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I replaced a iPhone 6S with 16BGB with this 11 Pro iPhone. What a step forward. Faster processor, better camera, better display, etc. I'm totally satisfied with this iPhone and would recommend to whomever is looking for a new iPhone to purchase. No scratches or defects with this phone and the charged battery last 2+ days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So I wasn‚Äôt even able to set up facial recognition it doesn‚Äôt even work at all and when I try to put in my password it will start typing in random numbers without me even touching it and then disable my phone for one minute I went to the Apple store see if I can get it fixed and they said it was gonna cost $600 because there‚Äôs no warranty on this phone from other reviews I‚Äôve read you are probably going to get a 50-50 chance of getting a phone that actually works properly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly, I originally was skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone but based on its physical appearence and performance, Im not too sure if its just renewed or brand new. Very pleased with this purchase. I still don't believe its NOT brand new, no scratches was on it or any type of marks. Zero flaws. Only thing that was missing which is stated when purchasing was not in original package and original apple charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 8 Plus completely cracked on vacation and I needed something to be home by the time I got back so I ordered this phone and it looks brand new and it works awesome, if you‚Äôre ordering expecting apple packaging or a brand new phone you clearly bought something without reading the description.... the battery health was at 98% and I‚Äôve had it for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs been an amazing upgrade!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far it‚Äôs working perfectly- looks great- battery lasts 24 hours (87% Battery Health) - really works well. I‚Äôm glad I bought it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone! Like new, no marks at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The extra storage is amazing! The phone came almost brand new, a big upgrade from my last, even if the battery life is 94% . I was hesitant to buy a phone online let alone at the price, but this was worth it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is great it has great battery life which is a plus good camera picture more. When I got the phone I didn‚Äôt have a case for it for a week and I‚Äôve dropped it many times and it did not scratch or break this phone is a beast buy the way it‚Äôs in an outer box now. Lol I love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came nice and no scratches or nothing everything worked well but it was lagging when I was trying to set it up but I didn't think much of it and continued to use it but I've had it for 3 days now and I'm going to return it because it has been nonstop lagging and glitching, I've restarted it, deleted stuff, reset it, cleared everything and it hasn't done a thing to help, I was listening to music and it was changing the song that was on, I had a friend next to me and had the phone laying down and neither of us was touching it and it was going through apps and I was on Spotify and it went to Instagram and started playing reels, I will be returning this item and I also believe it is hacked so I don't recommend this item to anyone. DO NOT BUY."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first I was skeptical about ordering a phone off of Amazon. But then when the phone came in and I took it out the box, it was gorgeous. It had a few scratches on a camera lenses but he didn‚Äôt stop the camera from working. The battery life is amazing. I literally charge this phone once a day. This is the best phone I ever had."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came in 2 days earlier that posted. It looks and works like new! Very happy with this phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice phone. I received the original charger as well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve submitted this review already but can‚Äôt find it‚Ä¶ it had a video that clearly showed the screen scratches but that was deleted from my phone after I submitted the review‚Ä¶ not sure what‚Äôs going on. It was not grade A renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I did order the MIDNIGHT GREEN version but was sent the space grey version. Minor detail as my dad doesn‚Äôt care, I just wanted him to have a matching green phone with a green case. Battery is about the same as mine, still is great shape. Was a breeze to setup but, it did have a hell of a time updating. It refused to update via iTunes. I restarted my pc, restarted iPhone, didn‚Äôt help. Updated OTA, almost didn‚Äôt work. Spent 6 or 7 hours downloading the update (McDonald‚Äôs WiFi is slow). Dad is slowly adjusting to an iPhone instead of an android."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It's definitely a change from the iphone 8. I've had it for about a week now and it seems to work really well. Getting used to not having the ""home"" button was easier than I thought. The phone is in great condition with a 94% battery capacity, no scratches, and an included screen protector already on the phone. I'll update if anything changes but it seems like a great buy so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Almost like new and included a few months of AppleCare left. No scratches or any flaws. Battery was at 91% as promised. I feel I really lucked out."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came perfectly but it was NOT fully unlocked which is the whole point in purchasing the phone so this was very unacceptable. Tried to connect to boost mobile carrier and was told still locked to sprint very disappointing when I spent my hard worked money, I did receive full refund but I wanted my item I paid."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mine was a ‚ÄúRenewed premium‚Äù The phone came in pristine physical condition: no scratches anywhere. Battery life is great. I would by a renewed premium without hesitation again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did have a minor scratch like half an inch on the screen but that‚Äôs about it. Everything else working fine, battery in perfect conditions, top and back of the phone in mint conditions. Unlocked so it was just inserting my sim card, putting my iCloud account and ready to go. Face ID flawless like a brand new phone, really no complaints, I‚Äôd take that little scratch on the screen for the massive discount I got it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very pleased with the product and customer service"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una belleza, no me hice falsas expectativas porque es muy clara el estatus de renovado, en mi caso recib√≠ la unidad con un peque√±o rasp√≥n casi imperceptible en la pantalla y con 93% de capacidad de bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I ordered this phone here I was worried it would go wrong. But now that I have it in my hands right now I can safely say that it is perfect! Some minor tiny scratches on screen, but barely noticeable. It‚Äôs still perfect nonetheless, it‚Äôs like if I actually bought it from an Apple Store. So I can safely say this was worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôve had the phone for a few days now, and all seems well. Great camera quality and responsiveness. Product was packaged as described, with the accessories described in the listing, and it arrived early. Cosmetic damage is as described for refurbished phones (very minimal, no noticeable damage when held at arm‚Äôs length.) at this time I am very satisfied with my purchase. However, as I said, I‚Äôve only been using the product for a few days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I do not usually order Apple ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù iPhones. I thought I‚Äôd take a chance & order it & hope it‚Äôs not a piece of scratched up junk.
Much to my surprise, I was amazed how ‚Äúalmost new‚Äù shape it was in! It had no scratches at all anywhere on it! I set it up and it works Great!
The price was perfect!
So, I purchased 2 more, one for my son & daughter!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","2 months in... so far so good. Battery capacity was at 100% when I received it. It came with a protective screen on it. Upon taking it off for a more durable screen protector I noticed there were scratches. HMMM... wasn‚Äôt too happy about that. But I did save $$$ of dollars buying this renewed. I‚Äôll take what I can get. Scratched are completely unnoticeable when protection screen is on. Woohoo!! Camera game has totally upgraded. 4K videos are poppin! I was able to send high quality interview videos and create great group project videos."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like a new phone so far , so good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Description said it worked and looked as new. It arrived with a light and a deep scratch on the screen. Disapointed"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it from WBB . Pristine condition. 100% battery Health. Just a tiny bit scratch on the upper right corner not visible though when the screen is on. Works flawlessly. Getting one and half day battery life with consistent usage. Honestly satisfied specially with this price"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love This IPhone! I haven‚Äôt owned an iPhone Max since an iPhone XS Max; and I wasn‚Äôt impressed with it all!
This iPhone 11ProMax might be heavier then the regular iPhone 11 but it has tons of features a regular iPhone 11doesn‚Äôt! It might be a refurb but it has no scratches on it at all! Love the storage of 512gb! It is lightning fast too!
Definitely worth every penny!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i keep my phone well protected with a nice solid case and screen protector. never abuse or over heat it. it is a company phone so it is used just for calls and txt. after 3 month of use the phone is now useless and is sad because i spent so much money on it."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it for my wife and so far so good, it hasn't given her any problem so i haven't had any problem with it.... Its overpriced as all IPhones are ...the face recognition is just as effective as any other in the market. They did do away with the finger print scanner. thats the only draw back"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The Phone Wasn't Supposed To Come On Until Friday...But It Came Today Instead üòÅ The Phone Is Bigger Than I Expected It To Be. The Only Thing I Don't Like Is There's A Scratch On The Screen And Then There's Beat Up Marks Around The Edge Of The Phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the cellphone it self looked pretty good at first with a very few scratches at the corners , it came with a screen protector applied and i didn't want to listen to other reviews who said that there are scratches on the screen but not visible until you remove the screen protector but in the first day a very weird issue was happening in which the screen become unresponsive after the battery drops below 50% , charge it and it becomes good again ,now this issue had me remove the screen protector to see if its causing the issue which reveled the scratches and a pretty ugly scuff , had to return ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it came in reasonably time. I loved the fact that it was unlocked. It was easy to activate it with my number in minutes. I‚Äôm just upset about loosing the finger ID,but what do you expect upgrading from a 6s+ to this now 11 pro max."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy bien lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 11 Pro Max arrived in less than 3 days and it was in perfect condition! I love this phone. It was packaged very well and immaculately clean with no scratched or marks.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Convinient. Excellent condition. Fast shipping."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don‚Äôt buy refurbished iPhone people are reporting phone stolen and selling them back"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. I just received the phone today, and I couldn‚Äôt even tell that it was refurbished (even though it is). My package contained the phone itself and what I think is the original charger. Some people complained about receiving cheap chargers with their orders, but that was not the case with my order. It looks brand new and works as it should. The phone was also shipped very quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I am satisfied with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am absolutely in love with my new phone. Have had it for about 3 wks now and my only complaint was not reading the Apple iOS 14 update before..so camera settings changed. I couldn‚Äôt revert. A complete nightmare for 3 days. However, proud of my purchase..worth the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù. Money wel spent. Face recognition works even in the dark lol forgive me I love it! Battery life was 100% healthy and works great. I would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone received in perfect condition. Absolutely no issues with phone or switching SIM cards. My cell carrier is AT&T. Previously had an iPhone 6, so this was a bit of an adjustment getting used to this bigger phone. It‚Äôs quite a bit thicker than my old phone, but not an issue. I can still fit it in my back pocket, lol."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life was at 94% capacity when I got it but considering how good the battery life is ! it was not a problem"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone and set it up and then the keyboard didn‚Äôt work after that. Can I return it and get another one in its place?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works perfectly,use it in UAE and works perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone works very well just like brand new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like it 96% battery but there's no original charger and earphone"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was pretty good but it came with the screen cracked, so I returned it and I bought it again and now I‚Äôm waiting for it, but if it wasn‚Äôt for that the phone was in pretty good conditions!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i received my device (midnight green 64gb iphone 11 pro max) today and am very pleased with the purchase so far. the phone arrived in flawless condition, no dents, chips, cracks, screen issues, nothing. on top of beautiful physical condition, it has a 99% battery health! it had a screen protector on it right out of the box, i didn‚Äôt have to get my own to put on. i received my package a day early, and overall am very very happy with the purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone 11 max pro did meet my expectations. Item was in a great condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vida √∫til de bateria 98%, est√©ticamente algunas rayas en las barras laterales y en la parte trasera del equipo lo dem√°s en perfectas condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Well recommended. Still a good phone at a good price. Battery always 95% no scratches. Very pleased with purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect condition, very happy that I saved money by buying this refurbished phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything looked and worked flawlessly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Las c√°maras muy claritas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was extremely nervous to order phone from here. I am writing this review to help any ones worries like I had. The refurbished phone I received had a TINY little scratch on top left corner. However the amount of money I saved and stress saved from going into store and purchasing is SO worth it. Highly recommended!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ill start off by saying when this arrived the box was ROUGH, i had no hope anything inside was in any working condition. If you handed me this phone without context I would believe it was brand new from Apple. It is spotless, battery lasts nearly two days without charging for me and my screen times is about 16 hours total. The facial recognition is great, albeit wearing a mask nowadays you will have to use the pin to unlock the screen. This is my first iPhone and I have no complaints."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the features.
Face recognition is the best thing since cane sugar was found. Has good battery life.
Good valve for cost."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great battery life and everything works as expected."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone I still actually have it my only gripe is that my speakers are not as loud as they should be for the money I spent but everything else works just fine"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am never buying Amazon renewed ever again. I swear as a someone who refurbishes and repairs phones myself I am appalled at the absolute GARBAGE that passes for quality in this industry. AMAZON should be BETTER than this, to sell something as REFURBISHED that has huge scratches on it like this.

but this is not ""Amazon renewed"" this is sold by a 3rd party seller who likely refurbed the device themselves. If I was refurbishing this and selling it for $1030 I would put a new LCD on there if it has a scratch!!!!!!!! They cost like $200. You will still make mad profit off of whoever you bought it from. You can deduct.

And Amazon if you censor my review I am turning my dissatisfaction to YOU! I WILL call Amazon corporate if this review is censored like some of mine have been in the past for warning customers about problems.

The other problem I had was that I was unable to cancel the order literally 15-20 after making it, and it did not ship for another 24 hours! This is not a ""it already shipped"" problem.

So basically I am $2000 in the hole right now and I am going to order this straight from Apple so I know I get a quality product. So $3500 in the hole until I get refunded for the first which should have been refunded and this one with the huge gauge on the screen.

Absolutely ridiculous. Stop selling things as ""Amazon renewed"" when they're refurbed by a third party."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Item was just as described, perfect!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in a box with charger, mine had a minor scratch on the top corner on the front and battery health is 87%. Had to call the phone company to set it up. Works well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works perfect was able to activate it with boost mobile easily. The value for the money is great. And the face recognition works perfect. All around a great phone and came with 94% battery life on its battery. So I‚Äôm happy with this purchase. And I would recommend this company to purchase from. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the phone but all the previous info from the person before wasn't erased."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy such an expensive phone brand new, but took the risk. I usually sign a finance agreement with T-Mobile for a new phone every 2 years but lately they have not had great deals and financing from them is a 3 year agreement. So, I decided to buy the phone renewed. Surprisingly, the phone arrived a couple days sooner than the expected delivery date. It had not scratches on it. I was able to swap my sim and start using it in a matter of seconds."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se actualizo el tel√©fono pensando que de esa forma se solucionaba, socio igual. Se reviso los par√°metros de teclado y sigui√≥ igual. El cristal posterior ten√≠a mancha por debajo del mismo indicando qu√© tal vez se sumergi√≥ el dispositivo. Es una pena, no recomiendo a este vendedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing much just what I stated"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Really good!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","After 3 renewed and refurbished phones I finally got this one and it was just like new!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like with everything on it , a battery heath is 100% brand new. App moving smooth and camera too. Nothing to dislike."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works perfectly. No scratches.

The seller is really good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first, I was quite skeptical because I had seen reviews saying the iPhones were locked or that they were cracked. But NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE!! Truly a professional seller with care and the utmost quality for their customers. It even had a screen protector pre-installed and its such a small thing, but its things like that make this shopping experience even better. I'll definitely go back to get my next iPhone from them in the future!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have owned and used extensively for 2 months and 10 days. Have no issues with any aspects. It did come with a glass screen protector installed properly which was nice. Cord and charger were not apple branded which was unfortunate. I""m sure the cord is inferior, but I have other cords around so its not a problem. No earbuds were included. Would accept the aftermarket auxiliary equipment again to save the money given that the phone seems to be pristine."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo excelente, funciona a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy f√°cil de usar pero muy malos de la bocina del o√≠do"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I purchased phone options were return and refund eligible now they‚Äôve changed it. I wanted to exchange for a phone with a higher battery life (apple recommends new battery at 80% and below) this phone is at 81%. I‚Äôve been emailing seller and they only responded ONCE! Tried to do refund and now I‚Äôm asked to pay shipping. I‚Äôll be contacting Amazon this is false advertisement!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It really really in great condition I thought it was new and it was a mistake but good for me that was not the case it was just a great certified great iPhone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Awesome phone love it everything‚Äôs perfect as described 100% satisfaction Highly recommend"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like new. Works like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got my iPhone 11 pro max a few days ago and I'm very happy. My iPhone came perfect, just a couple small marks of use but it looks super new. The battery life is 95% which is amazing. They sent me a device with screen protector!! I totally recomend you guys to buy from this company."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","ESTA MUY CARO PARA LAS CONDICIONES GENERALES DE IPHONE. MUY PELADO EN LOS BORDES."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No regrets"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","In a nutshell, refurbished is a bit of an overstatement. This phone dies pretty quick for it to be the Pro Max as I can‚Äôt make it an entire day without charging at least once by the later afternoon. Nevertheless, get what you pay for when it‚Äôs an used item. Can‚Äôt wait till the next phone release so I can get rid of this."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was skeptical about buying the iPhone 11 Pro Max after reading some of the reviews. But my phone came in perfect condition and there‚Äôs no scratches the only thing that I didn‚Äôt like was that it didn‚Äôt come with the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù apple charger but beside that I haven‚Äôt had any problems with the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone has never gave me problems I‚Äôve owned it for almost a year now. It‚Äôs still brand new. Everything works, I‚Äôm very happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought two phones a gold 11pro max and a silver 11pro max. My only problem is I activated my sliver 11pro max and didn‚Äôt realize the GB is wrong. When I purchased this phone it was suppose to have 256GB however, when you go to the settings it only has 64GB. I am PISSED like I already went through the trouble of activating the phone. Now I have to send it back ASAP because I don‚Äôt have nearly enough storage that‚Äôs the main reason why I made sure it had 256GB at purchase. I will never use them again.
Update: Got in touched with them they said they‚Äôll give me a full refund once I send the phone back. I‚Äôll update again once I do so."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Thank you the phone is very good health battery"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","it looks all great"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just got it this morning. Pretty happy so far. Still have a lot to learn about the phone. Many new features like it a lot"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Can't believe how immaculate the condition of this phone is. Not a single visible scratch, bump or imperfection. All components and functions work perfectly. It came with a black generic silicone case and generic charger. Fully unlocked and the best is battery 100% which to me seems they put a new one. 100% would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in perfect condition, a big upgrade from my iPhoneX. The front and back cameras are great with a much wider shot! The weight is around the same as the X despite the bigger size. I am using it with Xfinity Mobile with no issues"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm currently living abroad, but I ordered my phone and had it shipped to my parents. My sister unboxed it for me while we facetimed, and she approved the quality! She said the last owner took great care of it, and now she wants to swap phones!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone I received looks brand new. I'm shocked it's a used device. No issues with carrier or anything I was with sprint they just gave me t-mobile chip now that they are the same company. Got to keep my awesome plan and use the new phone best of both worlds. Thank you so much buySPRY for a great deal and a awesome phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works as expected"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was perfect accept one scratch on the top of the phone that wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the description but everything else was 5 stars"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","IPhone. Gift"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am very very happy with this refurbished iPhone 11 Max Pro!!! It‚Äôs so much faster than my 16 GB iPhone 6 that I had. Use the little paper clip looking object to easily swap out the SIM card. No need to go to a store to activate it for me! Love this!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular esta en excelentes condiciones, la vida del celular se encuentra en 89%. Est√©ticamente se encuentra muy bien, no he encontrado desperfectos y me ha dejado muy satisfecho. Eso s√≠, tener en cuenta que no llega en caja original ni con accesorios originales, de igual forma, pra mi fue una buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received a new phone with 100% battery capacity and a 1-year warranty by Apple. It works and looks like new, no scratches. It also has an original cord and charger (no earphones and original packaging). I was worrying regarding the purchase but I am happy with it now because I got the iPhone I wanted but 300 dollars cheaper.Great deal!Update: 3 month after the purchase phone works great."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono tiene grandes se√±as de desgaste en la pantalla, se nota que se ray√≥ una parte en exceso al pasar el dedo, tiene picada la parte superior y raspado uno de los bordes del lente, el vidrio trasero tiene como manchas, realmente no lo recomiendo ya que est√©ticamente est√° como un 6/10 en cuanto a la bater√≠a probablemente en 6 meses toque cambiarla porque ven√≠a con el 83%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had this phone for 6 weeks now and have had no problems. It works and looks great."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything appeared great when I first got this but about a week ago was the first time I ever needed to zoom with my camera and it shakes! Even when I steady it on the table. Pictures come out blurry and everything. I tried to contact the seller but I‚Äôm past my 90 days they said so I‚Äôm out of luck with a very expensive purchase. I wish I knew somewhere I could take it to get it repaired."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","All around great phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it ... good phone arrived with no scratches dents or marks and the charger that came with it is amazing it charges my phone completely in 30 mine very happy with my purchase don‚Äôt be scared order one from them u won‚Äôt be disappointed"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ABSOLUTELY love my new phone. It came in only two days it was charged so I didn‚Äôt need to charge it. There was zero cosmetic damage it was in perfect condition. I have Metro and it hooked right up no problem. I strongly recommend this company I couldn‚Äôt be happier."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","1) So far everything is working perfectly, not a scratch, 100% battery life, came with a screen protector on.2) 2 months later and I am still glad I bought this phone. The amazon refurbished has been no different than if I got it brand new.3) 1 month later, replaced the screen, it costs $329 everywhere right now.. just putting that out there, still paid it, still 5 stars."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm so glad I decided to do this instead of signing another contract. The phone works great and came in perfect condition. Great price, too. Didn‚Äôt want to go into debt.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was what I expected, there are a few scratches but for the price I paid, ehhh not whining much."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ muy bien, con 89% de bater√≠a, todo lo dem√°s en excelente estado, enviaron cargador y cable gen√©rico, no enviaron cargador r√°pido como viene de f√°brica."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","hice una compra del iphone renovado y lo cambie porque tenia 90% de bateria con vida util, y opte por comprar el iphone renovado premium, pensando que tendria mucha mas vida util de bateria y llego con una pila de vida util del 91%, es verdad que en la descripcion dice mas de 90% pero 1% no es nada para la diferencia del monto.en temas de estetica el iphone esta impecable, pero en temas de bateria me esperaba mucho mas, ya que es lo que mas importa en un celular"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought thinking it would be like new as stated and turns out it is a buggy, glitchy nightmare and will not be purchasing refurbished next time."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","My battery life is 87%, however the phone was in perfect condition. No scratches, cracks, nothing. I was scared to buy from here because of the reviews but ended up having a good phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone arrived a day earlier and without original cable and accessories buy that what you get when ordering renewed phones, External appearance is pristine and battery health 100%. the phone looks like new. Also I cannot buy AppleCare+ with no apparent reason. Looking into the IMEI everything seems legit and not refurbished or locked phone. Great product and great service from BuySPRY"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers sound like phone has water damage and very distorted. Everything else is ok. When you renew or refurbish a phone make wouldnt you make sure all features are working properly?"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Una decepci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came as requested and no problems whatsoever. I‚Äôve been using it the past few months since I got it and works amazing. No scam. Trustworthy seller. Battery lasts me almost 2 days of usage which I can‚Äôt complain about."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has scratches and battery health is 87% which means it dies FAST. $750 for a phone that‚Äôs not in tip top condition, kinda frustrating and disappointing. I would appreciate if I could have a replacement sent to me because this is now the only phone I have so I couldn‚Äôt just send it back until I get a replacement but disappointed to say the least."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it works perfectly other than me not being able to use the facetime app :-( but I‚Äôm sure it can be fixed some sort of way.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was perfect but it was listed as fully unlocked and it was not which is false advertising. It was policy blocked by consumer cellular. I don't recommend purchasing from this company. It took a whole lot of headache to figure out what company it was locked with and now my daughter has to use this company and not the original company she wanted."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with a cracked screen, sound was muffled with calling and music ect, the camera wasn't cracked but still bad white/circles when I would take a picture with the flash. Battery died way to quick, good picture quality without flash, fast phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","We purchased Iphone 11 from this seller 1.5 years ago and it pretty much started to have problems less than a year later. Now it's stopped working completely. The seller would not provide any type of help or assistance. Basically over one thousand dollars down the drain. Be aware."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs good!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is the fact that I bought it refurbished and the silent button on the side is stuck on the side. I could never get it fixed but can use assistive touch to mute or unmute but for what I paid I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta muy bien funciona al m√°ximo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far phone is been working good üëç"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen condition was WELL BELOW expectations. Think keys in the pocket and no screen shield kind of scratches. The aftermarket screen shield hides some of the damage. This was not at all what I was expecting for the money. I would have just bought new if I had to do it again... no point in trying to save money."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","In great condition, had two small scratches on the touch screen but everything else seems perfect. Battery health at 100% of maximum capacity. Came with a non-apple charging adapter and cable as well as a screen protector pre-installed."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reached out to company and Amazon (since they put their seal of approval on it being refurbished) about the volume on callers end being sketchy at best. Often have to put the phone on speaker bc the caller can‚Äôt hear me when phone is up to my ear. (No I‚Äôm not muting the phone) This is a known iPhone problem. I can only assume it‚Äôs why the phone needed to be refurbished in the first place. Anyway, I asked if a replacement could be sent (less than a month after purchasing phone) and then I send my phone back (or rightfully be charged for replacement). Told no. They said I can buy another one of their phones then send back the broken one. Sure, cause I have an extra $800 laying around to spend on another iPhone to replace the BROKEN one you sent to me?! No I can‚Äôt afford to do that. I am disappointed about getting a still broken ‚Äúrefurbished phone‚Äù. Save yourself the headache and buy a new phone"

Talked to numerous verizon employees who all guaranteed me that it is not compatible with their network. The description specifically says the phone is compatible with verzon. Returning. A very frustrating experience overall."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came as expected. Works as expected and loving the camera on this phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I‚Äôm In Love With My New Phone This Is One Of The Best Phones I‚Äôve Ever Had Thanks So Much For My Product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone come in excellent conditions, good battery life (96%), without scratches, but don't have original ac charger and cable, but the price is excellent."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone arrived in 24 hours, perfect as new not a single scratch, display protection already on and still in Apple warranty for another 7 months.
Thanks!!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is beautiful, as expected. However, it is glitchy, slow, and the facial recognition does not WORK. My only option is to go to the Apple store which is 2 hours away from my home. I'm seriously considering going back to my iphone 7...SO DISAPPOINTING!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent product. Very pleased with the quality of the phone. Will buy from this seller again."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal cell phone, the sound is really low and wont turn up"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Even it's a preown iphone 11 pro max, but still in good condition. The only negative thing is too heavy."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was near perfect, some imperfections on the screen but it was operational with great battery life."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing wrong with my device so far! I love it!! Came with a screen saver and charger.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had to return the phone due to the feel of a cheap screen replacement, felt like plastic and the touch response was delayed. Terrible phone to say the least. I am reluctant to buy another one. I am sure they are not all like this, but how many would you have to buy and return before you get a good phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Folks please remember that this is being advertised as a ‚ÄúRENEWED UNIT‚Äù. The amount of refurbishment efforts and QA-QC checks that was supposedly performed on the unit was clearly lacking on this one. After paying nearly $950, any buyer would be expecting, at the very least none of these visible imperfections (photos). Instead, I found a healthy amount of scratches around the entire phone perimeter, even in the area of the camera lenses! Now, what does it say about the overall phone condition, especially if you are planning to keep it for at least a year or two?

Not very pleased with this purchase.

BTW - This is my second attempt buying from this vendor. I initially bought a 256GB IPhone 11 Pro Max Gol (Renewed and Fully-Unlocked) from them. I had to return that one too since it won‚Äôt activate or accept a working SIM from T-Mobile. Perhaps, I was just being unlucky as other reviewers posted better results? Oh well."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received it in May and so far so great!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it and pasted it with a film, thinking how so good it is. It turned out that the surface was spent before I pasted it with a film. If I didn't put it on, I didn't know it. I didn't feel very good until I put it on. How can businesses do business like this?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I've had the phone for a week couldn't be happier works excellent no issues , thank you !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came in great condition. Battery 99% . I‚Äôm so love in love with this phone . Came a day early .."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen on this phone did not work. When I contacted this seller for support I was informed that I needed to pay and ship this phone back and then they would send me a new one out. I do not trust them to send a new one or one that was not also defective. I have had other sellers send a new item immediately and then I could return the defective device. Very unsatisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone came to me like new not a thing wrong with it just love this phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Been using it all day since it arrived. Love it so far. And it‚Äôs camera is incredible. Fastest phone I‚Äôve owned so far. Definitely worth 5 stars."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It‚Äôs just great and like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it! Great condition! Tiny scratch in the screen but nothing major and nothing anywhere else."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got the phone everything appeared fine. Until I decided to make a call. The speaker of the phone DOES NOT WORK. I messaged the seller about this and he was fully aware that the items had not been refurbished properly. He was aware of the problem and suggested I ‚Äúgo get it fixed for 50 bucks‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I bought two iPhones from them and it appears that they have the same issue. You can only hear the person on the other line if they are on speaker or if your earphones are connected. I would not recommend them at all. I asked for a partial refund and he said I was ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and ‚Äúnah he won‚Äôt do that‚Äù‚Ä¶ This has been an incredibly inconvenient and awful purchase. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came quick and in amazing condition. Also came with a glass ant-crack screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very efficient and fast ordering system and reliable delivery backed by Amazon brand, got this order in less than a week and the phone was just as described."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The speaker doesn‚Äôt work, so I can‚Äôt use the iPhone as an telephone, to have a normal phone call I have to use either headphones or the speakerphone. Unfortunately I will have to return the iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the iPhone 11 it is easy to use and has great features"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Front speaker doesn‚Äôt work. Hopefully can do a full replacement."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","A few minor surface scratches, but not distracting. Great care in shipping and included all standard accessories. Would buy from seller in the future."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am using the phone to take photos & videos and post them to social media. I like it a lot!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received this phone yesterday it‚Äôs very happy with the way it looked very easy to transfer from my other phone this morning I saw something funny on the TV went to record and it started humming it does the same thing when I go to take a picture I did notify the company but have not heard back yet so it‚Äôs risky business when you buy anything used especially when it comes from across the üåä"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first we were nervous buying a refurbished phone. However we purchased two of them. The phones were easy to swap over. The phones worked and looked like new. I would recommend buying from them."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything is going great with this new phone, works perfectly, and looks brand new, it came in a generic box, with generic charger and cable and no headset, but the phone its immaculate. I'm already using it."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great for the price and the fact that you can‚Äôt find the 11pro Max anywhere."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is very slow I‚Äôm so sorry I purchased this phone from this company.
It‚Äôs been a few months later and I‚Äôm still sorry I purchased this phone from this company ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Initially, the phone (iPhone 11 Pro Max) looked fine when I took it out of the box. The outer stainless steel band did have some minor scuffs, but nothing that bothered me. What was peculiar was that the phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, albeit misaligned. I decided to take it off and put my own. And immediately I could notice so many scratches on the screen. It was horrible and well hidden by the screen protector. More than anything, I just want to give this warning: these ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù/refurbished phones are not at the same standard like the ones at the Apple Store. They will be scuffed up. In addition, the battery health was at 98% capacity. From personal experience with my XS Max, it took an entire year for it to drop to that point from 100%. I can‚Äôt say how all these phones they sell will turn it, since YMMV, but a word of warning"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Value for money
I like it very much because it‚Äôs meet my expectations"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it for my wife as an anniversary gift and she won‚Äôt put it down. Absolutely loves it !!!"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° tan perfecto! Me encanta todo est√° muy bien"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Decided to switch to Apple after my Samsung screen cracked and bit was it a mistake. The refurbished phone was fine. The last time I owned an iPhone was the 3G... and I loved that. But since then there have been little improvements and changes. Compared to Android OS... and value in phone tech for the same price... there is no comparison. I tried hard... but IOS is so limiting, so antiquated, so slow, so many more strokes and presses to do simple tasks that is was painful. I really don't get why Apple fanatics done at least try Android before claiming it is far better like most do. They are ignorant at best."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone with the understanding I would be able to get AppleCare but when I try to sign up the apple website says ""We‚Äôre sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced."" After this I was thinking about returning the phone within the 3 month return window. Before doing so I dropped the phone and the back glass cracked. I wrote the seller asking if I could return it (even if for a refund for less/just a partial refund) and they said no. Basically once you buy this phone you are on your own so better hope you get a good one!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with audio issues: I know when phones are renewed they‚Äôre not the same as new anymore but come on, having to pay $600 for a phone that has audio problems is not worth it.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El telefono llego fisicamente bien, la bateria en 98% pero la 1 estrella es por que me vino con el earspeaker da√±ado, se escucha increiblemente mal, no entiendo como una compa√±ia tan grande como ustedes no se percatan del estado real del dispositivo, yo pague $100 dolares para reritarlo del currier ya que vivo fuera de estados unidos, ahora tengo que pagar otros $100 dolares mas para enviarselos, estoy demasiado decepcionado de ustedes, tremendo dolor de cabeza que me acaban de dar"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone for work purposes, the package does not come in original Apple packaging which was something I did not have a problem with but the first thing I noticed was some scratches on the camera lenses which I was able to ignore until the phone started crashing and lagging after only 1 week of use. I had to take it to a local repair shop and pay $300 to get it fixed which was a real bummer for me. Overall not worth the full price paid (almost $1000)."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was nice and all and it worked but when I was trying to get activated with my cellular company they told me the phone was stolen or has been missing. So I beg of you do not get this phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone arrived in perfect condition. I noticed that the camera 1.0 was not focusing correctly . I am not sure if it is a software or hardware problem. I decided to return it. If you buy it, make sure to check everything on it. Don‚Äôt simply trust just because it is being purchased at Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would not recommend purchasing a refurbished device from Amazon. Shortly after my 90 day warranty expired my Apple Pay has quit working and is not able to be fixed. Amazon is not able to help me since the warranty has expired. It's not worth saving a couple of dollars ordering it from Amazon, but it from someone that will stand behind device defects longer than 90 days."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I don‚Äôt like the fact I bought two of the same items and they had identical scratches on them which were very very visible and deep poor on your side to sell this at such a high price point‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased my iphone 11 pro max in August 2020 and now the front camera isn't working properly. It has 2 horizonal lines and purple tint. I contact the seller and he informed me that I had to contact Apple. I went to the Apple store and was informed that this is an hardware issue and it will cost approximately $400 to repair. I'm very disappointed that I trusted this seller.

Disappointed Customer,

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","it's good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","At the beginning when I got the phone, every thing looks new and perfect. I was so excited. But then I started noticing the phone restarts on its own randomly during the day. I may not be doing anything at the moment. But it still restarts on its own. The frequency of restarting began to raise a concern to me. I reached out to the seller Buyspry, they asked me to restore and restart the phone but it did not help. I reached out the apple to find a solution and they said the battery was fine. There were panic logs on my phone as well. Scheduling an appointment with the Geniusbar took forever due to the pandemic. I bought another phone from the same seller but the issue is still the same. The phone also restarted even without me installing anything to it so I returned it. But now I‚Äôm stuck with a phone that restarts all the time and they say they won‚Äôt accept the return anymore. It‚Äôs frustrating. I recommend either try another seller or make sure you get additional insurance."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had an iPhone basically since they have first started making them. I like iPhones.
But the iPhone 11 is the worst phone I have had in the last 15 years. I hate this phone so much. Just get the iPhone 8 if you want a decent iPhone.
I regret that I did not do further research on this piece of junk.
Ever aspect sucks. It has issues pairing with Bluetooth devices. It has issues with syncing to files, connecting to WiFi. The finger print scanner is gone and sometimes the phone will open up quickly and other times it takes 30 seconds just to get the screen to light up, even when poking it with a finger over and over (no case or anything to prevent it from having issues here).
Trust me, I like iPhones. Never had any of these issues before. Save yourself the overpriced amount that this phone is and even more so, save the frustration that comes with it."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought the phone from apple, it was more expensive, but it came with warranty. I would recommend to upgrade if you have the money to spare, but if you have the iPhone x or newer is not worth it as you will not feel much difference."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the iPhone came ! It works perfectly fine I was scared to order because of the negative reviews but it came in perfect condition.
Update : couple weeks later it‚Äôs still working perfectly fine"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love every thing about this phone the emojis when you face time to"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Best thing I ever bought."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not worth 1 star. DO NOT ORDER!!!
I reture the phone since June 29. They got the package since july 1 but they dont refund the money back. I calling them everyday nothing updates. Only thing i want is the money back so i can order another phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it. Worth every penny and picture quality is amazing. Thank you."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It arrived in excellent condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen suddenly magnifies to a point you are not able to even turn it off for a reset. The screen freezes and will not allow any movement to clear the screen and return to the usable screen one to open another app. This requires that you try and turn the phone off to hopefully re-set itself but the screen is magnified so large that turn the turn off slide is barely visible by one of it's edges.
FRUSTRATING !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it brand new and the phone died after 4 months (we're talking about a phone thats worth more than a $1,000). Lost all the info and images. Took it to Apple, they ""fixed"" it and returned after several days. The fixed phone lasted only 2 months and started restarting non-stop. Will never buy an Apple product again. Read on the internet, there millions of people complaining about Apple products."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is the best thing ever I need a nother one for free please."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Suck"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worst Amazon Experience till date with a third party seller. BuySRY is the name i think. JUST DON'T BUY THIS. You'll regret it. The item is defective and the seller will promise you resolutions after proof only to deny you everything. Horrible experience and i hope no one has to go through the same thing again. Poor communication by the seller and Amazon reps also led to more hassle. Had to get a resolution from the executive team who were very helpful."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Absolute garbage. These aren‚Äôt renewed, they are just old used phones. Both of my iPhones came with marked/scratches up screens. The bottom of the phones also have a void sticker."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Why the hell would you spend that much!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did not meet my needs"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don't waste your money the phone is a hunck of junk you can't download very easily and no power supply and no manual for phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone arrived without a SIM tray. I cant determine if its locked or unlocked . had some wear and scratch. Will update review ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","you might as well pay for a brand new phone on the apple website. why pay this price for a refurbished discontinued iphone... come on guys"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Scean broken."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","High price and low specs as compared to Huawei P40 pro."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is a USED Phon Not a brand new one!
Be aware people!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It glithes a lot I would not buy it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone!! Make sure you order the upgraded refurbished from Amazon. Do NOT buy from a third party. Both my past two phones were from buyspry and Jem jem. Horrible phones. Visible scratches and degraded batteries. I made certain that this time is was actually refurbished by Amazon and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Absolutely NO scratches. 99 percent battery health. Looks brand new and works brand new as well. I love the larger screen. Perfect for gaming, reading, watching movies etc. The camera is phenomenal! Sound is nice and sharp. Synced up beautifully with my Apple watch, iPods, blink cameras and beats headphones. Will update if anything changes or goes wrong. However, so far, after a week it‚Äôs still performing wonderfully."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all, look at the trade in value at the top of the listing. They currently give UP TO $491 for an 11 Pro Max. That would be for a 512GB in perfect condition. For the 256GB I ordered in ""fair"" condition for $742, they probably gave the previous owner $300-$400. After receiving the phone, they dust out the holes, give you $10 worth of a cheap short charger cable and transformer brick I already have tons of. Then jack up the price $300-400 for 15 minutes of work and $30 in shipping / charger cable.

I paid $742 and $750 for the first and second phones I ordered respectively. The first phone came with a chinese aftermarket screen. Newer iphones can detect when an aftermarket screen is used and AFTER transferring all my data it appeared with the message. About 1 in 10-20 keystrokes would misregister and the key next to it, even sometimes across the keyboard it would hit backspace. The 3D touch would not work properly either and the color shade was off from a genuine screen. Another issue when replacing screen is the waterproof seal is broken. While this is replaceable when replacing the screen, who knows if it was done at all, much less properly. This phone arrived totally dead, which is TERRIBLE for lithium batteries. The battery was at 90% of new capacity, which is the bare minimum for what I would consider acceptable on a $750 phone.

With that POS on the way back to the seller, I decided to take a chance on a second one, this time for a few more dollars. It arrived about 50% charged, which is best for long term lithium battery storage. However, the battery was already down to 84% of new capacity. With 6 months of use it would likely be down another 5-10% capacity. At 75-80% the phone actually slows down to reduce power consumption. I don't consider this to be acceptable for how much they want for these used phones. I purchased this hoping to get 2-3 years of use from it, but the factory battery will be absolutely pathetic if used for that time already starting from 84%.
I have swapped many iphone screens and batteries, each generation Apple makes it more challenging. This phone would be my most difficult yet. Also the chinese batteries sold on this site are always sketchy and iffy on quality vs a new genuine one that you can't purchase from apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got the iPhone 11 Pro Max with ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù. Phone is perfect cosmetically. Worked out of the box and activated seamlessly. Recommend this seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is the second iphone I buy refurbished from Amazon (1st time from this seller). Everything works great on this phone! I tested face recognition, touch screen, phone calls and camera. Functions as intended. Battery percentage is good at 87% (same as my last phone) and it came in completely unlocked and ready to go. No visible scratches on screen, back glass or frame, I‚Äôd rate this products appearance a 9.5/10 looks almost brand new. This specific one is the rose gold with 256gb storage. The packaging was a little lacking in interior padding but the phone arrived undamaged. Also came with an original charger and cable which is a plus!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this to replace my iphone 8 plus. Apple and my cel carrier had the 12 and 13 on back order but I dont need the latest model. I got the 11 refurbished and unlocked and saved hundreds of dollars but got a much better phone with waaaay more storage. So now I can download all the apps without worrying about my phone not having storage. It was pretty easy to transfer all my contacts etc to the new phone too. I am thrilled with this purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First, I think I should mention that there‚Äôs no damage to the screen but there‚Äôs a considerable amount of scratches to the body. There‚Äôs no earbuds in the box and you receive cheap 3rd party accessories. Since this is a renewed product, I would be okay with this. However, I‚Äôve come to discover that I received a 256 GB instead of the 512 GB option I ordered. This is either a mistake from the seller or an outright scam and misinformation on the listing. PLEASE check your device‚Äôs about section to check the storage capacity. I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôll never buy Amazon renewed products again and will buy from my carrier or from Apple themselves. I encourage you to do the same."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all this Seller on Amazon is great to work with ! I was having an issue with the phone that I couldn‚Äôt figure out and this seller went out of their way to help. I didn‚Äôt want to return the phone as it is great. So you can buy with confidence from them. I was also worried about ordering a refurb phone from some of the experiences of others But all has been just fine here. The phone is pristine condition and seems to be working great ! I guess time will tell but right now I am happy and I would definitely buy from this company again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","$570 por esto!, estoy realmente sorprendido, es un buen tel√©fono y me parece su punto m√°s fuerte el 94% de vida √∫til de la bater√≠a, llego el mismo d√≠a que lo ped√≠ gracias a Prime, su caja tra√≠a un cargador gen√©rico y un protector de pantalla de vidrio, algo normal en los tel√©fonos de segunda mano es los rayones, este ven√≠a con dos rayones bastante grandes en la pantalla, (No interfieren con la visi√≥n de la pantalla y no se perciben a una distancia considerable), cuando puse el protector de pantalla desaparecieron por completo as√≠ que es un buen punto, un case y todo esta perfecto, espero siga as√≠ estos meses, todo parece bien, la tarjeta sim la tomo sin problemas y tomo solo unos minutos en llevar la informaci√≥n de mi viejo Iphone a este.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just couldn‚Äôt get my self to pay what AT&T wanted so I started looking around for alternatives. Found this phone on Amazon and ordered it based on their return policies if not satisfied.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","For a refurbished phone, this device is in excellent condition. It‚Äôs super clean, not a single scratch or dent. It‚Äôs really immaculate and I‚Äôm super happy to purchase from Buyspry. Battery life was 88% really low but it could pass.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good deal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone is not in the iPhone original box and the adapter the charger is not Apple brand"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone quality was perfect, seemed brand new. No scratches or nicks"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have to start this review off by saying there is absolutely no reason why you should be buying a brand new iPhone if the renewed version is available for hundreds of dollars less. The phone I received had one VERY minor imperfection, but it was something that was easily hidden by a case. In my experience, very few used phones come with zero scratches, so you have consider the ones with an imperfection on the side or on the back as a perfect used phone. Remember that it isn't new, but you can make it look new by putting it in a case. That's what I did and none can tell. Buy renewed from Amazon!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn‚Äôt even last a week. The screen came off within the same week I received the phone & I had a screen protector and a hard back case & never even dropped it . Now I‚Äôm back using my old phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","i like the camera...how fast it is when I look thru my apps..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buena calidad del empaque, producto en excelentes condiciones y funciona a la perfeccion"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looked great and worked great, but the parts they Renewed in the phone made it not able to connect to a network. It had two sims that wouldn't work. And one of them was a internal sim which the 11s don't have. So they put a part for say a 12 or 13 into the 11 making it not usable as a cellular device. Glad I can return to get my money back but wish I could trust amazon to have a device I could use."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worth it all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is renewed but when it arrived it looked almost brand new! I almost couldn‚Äôt tell it wasn‚Äôt brand new, wonderful job!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is in good condition just cameras on back are scratched."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought refurbished from Amazon, had reservations but all is working. Read MANY reviews and came to conclusion that this was the best choice for me. Many reviews said that buying up to the 12 or 13 model was overspending and not gaining much.This phone works great, enjoy the speed and all the other features not on previous phone.
I did buy the extra 1 year guaranteed, I think is was an extra $60. but made me much more comfortable."

Pictures of dog have blazing yellow I with no easy way to prevent it. They want want me to edit it after the fact.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono tard√≥ una semana en llegar, un d√≠a antes del previsto, la verdad lleg√≥ de muy muy buena calidad, hasta ahorita que llevo 2 horas us√°ndolo funciona perfectamente, lo uso con red Telcel y agarr√≥ perfectamente la se√±al, de igual manera est√©ticamente se ve casi en perfecto estado, solo un peque√±o golpe en una esquina pero lo √∫nico, en la pantalla todo perfecto, sin ning√∫n detalle y era mi mayor miedo porque vi muchos comentarios donde estaba rayada y este lleg√≥ todo perfecto, bocinas, Face ID, llamadas, c√°maras, todo en perfecto estado, como si fuera todo nuevo. El √∫nico detalle es que lleg√≥ con 84% de bater√≠a, yo creo que un poco m√°s y ya todo hubiese sido perfecto para mi, lleg√≥ en una carga custom y el cargador y el cable no son originales, para que tengan en cuenta eso. Por el precio me parece una compra excelente y yo si recomiendo ampliamente comprarlo."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me parece una excelente compra por el costo y el modelo del telefono, aun cuando ya tiene sus a√±itos funciona muy bien y aun le quedan otros a√±os de actualizaci√≥n.El unico detalle que yo le encontr√©, es que le cambiaron la pantalla, no es la original de Apple, aun as√≠ es una buena pantalla, tambi√©n es oled, pero si la comparas con otro iphone con pantalla original si se ve la diferencia, pero es algo que realmente en el dia dia ni se nota, funciona muy bien.Est√©ticamente lleg√≥ bien sin detalles y con pila al 89%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Parese nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","compre este articulo hace ya a√±o y medio masomenos sigue en buen estado, excelente la camara, lo unico que he tenido problemas es que no se escucha cuando me llaman y tampoco vibra cuando me llaman pero todo lo dem√°s todo esta excelente.cuando me llego venia con dos marcas de chupones al frente dando a entender que ya lo hab√≠an abierto, as√≠ que nuevo nuevo pues no es.lo revise y si dec√≠a que ya hab√≠a sido abierto.pero bueno de todo lo dem√°s estoy muy contenta con el telefono."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","He aprendido a no dudar de la calidad de los productos reacondicionados. No me ha fallado para nada este celular y lleg√≥ con buen porcentaje de bater√≠a. Cuando puedas, aprovecha."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, est√©tica de 9.5/10, le doy esta calificaci√≥n por el echo de que yo esperaba mejor volumen en el altavoz, tambi√©n yo esperaba mejor condici√≥n en la bater√≠a, me llego con un 84% que no est√° tan mal pero si muy pronto tendr√© que cambiarle la bater√≠a al dispositivo, que ah√≠ si ya le sumar√≠a otro gasto, fuera de eso todo sali√≥ bien, me agrado que llegara pronto hasta antes de lo esperado, que llegara con garant√≠a tambi√©n y todo bien empacado, solo por el detalle de la bater√≠a y del altavoz le doy 4 estrellas, le dar√≠a 4.5 pero Amazon no me permite poner .5, tambi√©n esperaba un cable original pero el gen√©rico est√° bien y tambi√©n esperaba que llegara con un cubo de 20w pero llego con un cubo bueno y me agrado la compra, recomiendo al vendedor al 100"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","me lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones y si es original"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba en excelente condici√≥n"

Es que pr√°cticamente parece nuevo en verdad, el √∫nico detalle que podr√≠a tener es que la pila tiene una condici√≥n del 85% pero hasta ahora no me ha resultado en un problema, ha aguantado perfectamente todo el d√≠a. Excelente compra hasta ahora."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funcionalmente bien, aunque encontr√© detalles en las condiciones f√≠sicas del iphone como unos rayoncitos alrededor de las c√°maras, y en los botones. A primera vista s√≠ se nota que tuvo un buen tiempo de uso, pero no hay una falla o golpe mayor que sean muy notables"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Como nuevo. Todo fant√°stico."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusta √©l tama√±o, y sobre todo siempre he usado Apple, a√∫n no lo estren√≥‚Ä¶estoy segura que me dar√° excelente servicio!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en muy buenas condiciones el celular üëåüëå si lo recomiendo y aparte el soporte de atenci√≥n a cliente muy buena !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo pr√°cticamente nuevo, con 100 % de est√©tica, bater√≠a al 90%, hasta ahora funcionando a la perfecci√≥n, llevo 3 semanas con el ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Casi un a√±o con el y mi compa√±ero de viaje no me ha dejado tirado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo con mi celular 6 meses, la pila muy bien, no tengo que cargarlo a cada rato, excelente calidad, pantalla intacta, si recomiendo mucho si deseas comprar algo a un buen costo, volver√© a comprar pronto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","el dispositivo esta en perfectas condiciones, veo que trae soporte t√©cnico applecare si es valida esta garantia ?"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a. La verdad us√°ndolo bien bien te dura la bater√≠a un d√≠a.En cuanto a estado del equipo, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ sin un solo ray√≥n, ni parece usado, la condici√≥n es excelente.Obvio, llega en una caja diferente a la original, bien sellada eso si, tambi√©n trae un cargador y cable s√∫per gen√©ricos, pero funcionan.Por el precio, est√° bien. Es un excelente producto, muy recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encanto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despues de 2 meses de uso no me ha dado ningun problema, me llego con 100% de bateria"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo ya con el 1 mes y todo Perfecto llego con el 90 de bater√≠a y sin ning√∫n golpe anteriormente hab√≠a comprado otro iPhone pero con distribuidor de Amazon y lo tuve que regresar al mes por que se calentaba y se perd√≠a la se√±al con este hasta ahora todo bien!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, lo recomiendo pero mucho ojo con la condicion de la bateria"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great condition, battery life is phenomenal, priced less than purchase of a new one, so saving money is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","bueno en relaci√≥n calidad/precio, si lo volver√≠a a comprar.El unico detalle es la bater√≠a no esta al 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy impresionado con la est√©tica del equipo celular, sin ning√∫n ray√≥n, el equipo es totalmente nuevoVolver√≠a a comprar otro celular sin problema, 100% recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","pues esta apenas todo va bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si venia muy maltratado m√°s de los dem√°s que he comprado como reacondicionado pero su funcionamiento es bueno pero no se siente como otros enviados directo de Amazon. Desde el embalaje y caja en una caja sencilla que hasta da miedo pensar que lo enviaron en paqueter√≠a y fue por ah√≠ brincando.Y este toc√≥ que estuviera como manchado de la pantalla pero s√≥lo del cristal y solo se ve si lo ves a contraluz y un poco rayado del cromado del arco pero con el case ya no se ve."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","LLEG√ì CON EL 100% DE BATER√çA, HA FUNCIONADO MUY BIEN, SIN PROBLEMAS, Y F√çSICAMENTE PERFECTO."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a, tiene un peque√±o ray√≥n perceptible en la parte de las bocinas inferiores. Salvo por eso la est√©tica es casi perfecta, estoy contento con mi compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de casi un a√±o de uso, el iPhone funciona perfectamente bien. La verdad ten√≠a el pendiente de comprar un celular reacondicionado pero hasta ahora absolutamente todo sirve EXCEPTO por las bocinas; no est√°n reventadas pero tampoco est√°n funcionando al 100% (si utilizo el altavoz en una llamada a veces puede ser dif√≠cil de escuchar). De cualquier forma como utilizo aud√≠fonos y la bocina superior para llamadas no me representa ning√∫n problema. Cuando me lleg√≥, me lleg√≥ en caja gen√©rica y sin cargador. NO me lleg√≥ con abolladuras o pantalla rayada o cualquier detalle visible. Se ve√≠a pr√°cticamente nuevo. La verdad si lo recomiendo porque los precios del Iphone Pro Max en M√©xico en esas fechas estaban por 20-30 mil pesos en diferentes tiendas y me ahorre un mont√≥n de pejedolares."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hice mis compras con diferentes vendedores pero el mismo producto Amazon me lo marca en el mismo lugar.En la primera compra el celular ven√≠a perfecto, bater√≠a al 100% sin ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, original y pr√°cticamente nuevo, lo √∫nico fue que no ven√≠a liberado, no me pudieron ayudar y tuve que devolverlo, ese vendedor ya no ten√≠a m√°s dispositivos, tuve que buscar otro.La segunda compra, el celular funcionaba ""bien"", me lleg√≥ con 85% de bater√≠a y muy manchado del cristal de la parte trasera, as√≠ que eso no me agrad√≥ y decid√≠ darle la oportunidad unos d√≠as, pero revisando con otros iphone de conocidos,!la c√°mara ven√≠a de muy mala calidad!, se ve√≠a muy borrosa a comparaci√≥n de los otros celulares, eso fue lo que me hizo decidir regresarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto me llego con un d√≠a de retraso, llego en una caja gen√©rica. El cargador tambi√©n gen√©rico.La est√©tica le pongo un 10, la pantalla vino con mica de cristal templado.No le he notado ning√∫n ray√≥n en la pantalla ni nada. Llevo poco mas de una semana con el, y hasta ahora funciona bien. En cuanto a la degradaci√≥n de la bater√≠a llego con el 93%.El producto lo compre en $11,999 a 1 a√±o, a meses sin intereses.Lo negativo:Al momento de actualizar a IOS15.5 la bater√≠a se degrado al 88% (ver imagen) pregunto:Esto es normal?Ya me comunique con BuySPRY y me respondieron, les mande la captura de pantalla de la salud de la bater√≠a, as√≠ como el IMEIConclusi√≥n: En general estoy contento con la compra, el √∫nico defecto, es que la salud de la bater√≠a se deterioro, al actualizar el sistema operativo. por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ con el 85% de la bater√≠a y las bocinas no se escuchan bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El proceso de adquirir mi dispositivo fue muy particular ya que encontre la publicaci√≥n y 20 minutos despues decidi comprarlo, obviamente por ser una compra por internet de un celular ‚Äúcaro‚Äù, ‚Äúdiscontinuado‚Äù y re acondicionado no me sentia del todo seguro, ya que pense que iba a ser un tipo de estafa o no iba a llegar en las condiciones que yo esperaba, afortunadamente todo lo que pensaba termino siendo falso ya que llevo aproximadamente 2 semanas usandolo dia y noche y no me ha presentado falla alguna hasta el momento, cabe destacar que lo recibi sin da√±o alguno y con la condicion de mi bateria al 94%, me apoye mucho de los comentarios de la publicaci√≥n y estuve consciente de que era confiar y tener un poco de suerte en que no llegara da√±ado, repito, hasta ahorita todo ha ido bien y lo seguire usando dia noche, afortunadamente igual el celular cuenta con garantia con amazon y es original, igual desconfie un poco por el precio ya que en otros lugares val√≠a m√°s y por menos capacidad en la memoria, pero un consejo que les puedo dar es que lo intenten, comprenlo, pruebenlo, chequen como aplica la garantia y en caso de que les falle lo devuelven sin ningun tipo de problema."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es reconstruido como dicen, lo malo es que no utilizan partes originales por lo tanto el tel√©fono tiene la caracter√≠stica de detectar el componente que no es original. A pesar de todo esto el tel√©fono funciona correctamente, hasta el momento no he encontrado ning√∫n problema para su correcto funcionamiento. en cuanto a la est√©tica es pr√°cticamente nuevo no cuenta con ninguna ray√≥n. Porcentaje de la bater√≠a es del 100%."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought a beautiful iPhone 11 Pro Max for $575. Phone is in about excellent 9.5/10 physical condition. Came with a aftermarket charger and cable. 86% battery capacity. Took about 1 week to come from Kansas to Ontario. Factory reset and unlocked.The only thing is‚Ä¶ the ear speaker was very crackly and distorted at any volume. It sounded like a blown speaker and made it quite hard to understand people when using the phone as a‚Ä¶ phone or watching videos.Seller offered a full refund and sent a shipping label. It turns out (after talking to a phone repair company) the speaker mesh was caked in fine dirt and grime, duct tape pulled the dirt from the ear piece. Works like new now but I guess it wasn‚Äôt fully ‚Äúclean‚Äù as advertised."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno dispositivo si lo encuentras en oferta aprovecha lleg√≥ con 94% de bateria funciona con Telcel en M√©xico y con Redi Coppel sin problemas con Altan redes"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio tenia dudas por algunos comentarios negativos que llegue a encontrar, decid√≠ arriesgarme y realic√© la compra. El paquete lleg√≥ 2 d√≠as antes de lo estimado por lo cual fue bastante r√°pido. En cuanto a la est√©tica es bastante buena, ligeros rayones en los cromos laterales y un peque√±o ray√≥n en pantalla, que se disimula bastante bien con un protector de pantalla, en cuanto a la parte trasera, la est√©tica es impecable, en cuanto a bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 86%.Llevo poco tiempo us√°ndolo y hasta el momento no ha presentado ning√∫n problema. El √∫nico detalle negativo que encontr√©, fue el cargador y cable que traen, se sienten de muy poca calidad y la carga es bastante lenta. Recomiendo comprar uno original para evitar problemas posteriores con la carga o bater√≠a del equipo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was a great purchase, my old phone broke and needed a new one ASAP without wanting to spend too much. Shipping was fast and when I got the phone in hand I couldn't even tell it was used. Literally no scratches, scuffs, marks, dents, dirt or anything along the lines, the phone looked perfect. When I turned it on to use, setup was easy and without any problems even though I am in Canada and the phone is from the US. The battery is at 100% capacity and lasts me the whole day + some without charging. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and it has been great.There was only one problem I ran into which was my connection dropping frequently but after taking out my sim card and cleaning it and putting it back in the problem seemed to have went away, so I will update if this problem comes back, but so far it's good."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 10 d√≠as con el tel√©fono, lleg√≥ en muy buenas condiciones, en una caja gen√©rica con cargador y cable gen√©rico como lo menciona en la descripci√≥n, no tra√≠a ning√∫n ray√≥n en los bordes o en la parte de atr√°s, le quit√© la mica protectora de la pantalla y solo trae dos peque√±as rayitas como si lo hubiesen metido a la bolsa y se hubiese rayado con monedas o llaves, pero no afecta el funcionamiento, le volv√≠ a colocar la mica y todo parece nuevo, ya no ten√≠a garant√≠a apple care, trae una condici√≥n de vida del 91% y me indica que sigue calibrando la bater√≠a, al t√©rmino de la calibraci√≥n baj√≥ a 89%, me hubiese gustado que viniera con m√°s condici√≥n de vida como le√≠ en la mayor√≠a de comentarios que tra√≠an arriba del 95%, pero bueno, el face id funciona muy bien, el volumen, micr√≥fono y bocina funcionan muy bien, la c√°mara es una belleza, y creo que fue una buena compra, es recomendable comprar el cable y cargador original para mantener la bater√≠a en buenas condiciones, seg√∫n Apple tener hasta un 80% de bater√≠a es √≥ptimo, aunque repito, me hubiese gustado que trajera mejor condici√≥n que 89%‚Ä¶aun as√≠ es una buena compra. Espero siga funcionando de manera adecuada."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el tel√©fono llego impecable con un 92% de bater√≠a, con el color que ped√≠ incluso ya ven√≠a con un cristal de protecci√≥n.Lo que no me gusto es que viene con un cargador gen√©rico que no es el original y se calienta mucho cuando lo pongo a cargar y en solo 2 d√≠as bajo de 92% al 90% la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a. Considero que por el precio de $15,500 pesos debi√≥ incluir un cargador original para que esta parte no se afecte ya que al ser un producto re acondicionado esto si le afecta al tel√©fono y es costo cambiar una bater√≠a nueva. (PD m√°ndenme un cargador original üôèüèº)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de 3 meses de uso, el celular funciona sin problemas. Vale la pena adquirir estos productos. Me llego con 86% de bater√≠a y algunos rayones en la pantalla. Con el protector de pantalla no se nota ning√∫n ray√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","LO COMPRE POR QUE ME ABURRI DE LIDIAR CON EL ALMACENAMIENTO CON OTROS IPHONES, ME DEDICO A LA CREACION DE CONTENIDO ASI QUE EL ALMACENAMIENTO ME ES INDISPENSABLE, PARA MI FUE UNA INVERSION MAS QUE UN LUJO. Y ESTOY SATISFECHO, SIN EMBARGO HAY QUE SUPER CUIDARLO POR QUE ES ALGO PESADO Y UNA CAIDA DUELE."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despu√©s de una p√©sima experiencia con achemex con una primera compra donde me llego una pila en vez del iphone, escog√≠ a buyspry por sus buenos comentarios, me llego un equipo con bater√≠a al 83%, todo original excepto el display, la aplicaci√≥n 3utool me indico que fue cambiado y si se nota porque tiene algo de pegamento a los costados, el display esta un tanto rayado por el uso y todo lo dem√°s esta impecable, debido a la urgencia que tengo decid√≠ qued√°rmelo, pero estar√° al pendiente del funcionamiento,"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vamos, el tel√©fono en s√≠ es de muy buena calidad y por el precio, vale la pena comprarlo.Apenas lo recib√≠ hace unos d√≠as y estoy probando su funcionamiento, rendimiento y funciones para decidir si es un equipo que vale la pena quedarme o hacer efectiva la garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as que se ofrece al adquirirlo.Hasta el momento los detalles que he encontrado, a pesar de saber que es un equipo usado, tiene bastantes rayones en la pantalla frontal que no afectan el funcionamiento y suelen pasar desapercibidos con una mica protectora, algunos detalles en los biseles de las c√°maras y dos o tres golpes y raspaduras en los bordes del tel√©fono, no parece nada grave pero la est√©tica deja que desear y ""se nota"" que es un equipo usado.Otro detalle, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 87%, comprensible al ser usado, pero ser√≠a un plus que tuviera por lo menos un 90%.En general con la compra, bien, nada extraordinario pero con miras a hacer uso de la garant√≠a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ en condiciones perfectas, pr√°cticamente nuevo. Recomiendo comprar"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente, en primer lugar el dispositivo venia sin ningun da√±o fisico, lo revis√© a detalle y no encontr√© ni un solo ray√≥n, vino sin problemas de software y la condici√≥n me llego en un 85%, pens√© que ser√≠a un problema eso de la bater√≠a pero la pila me dura todo el d√≠a, llevo usandolo dos meses y no he tenido ning√∫n tipo de problema, las rese√±as que le√≠a antes de animarme a comprar el iphone me desanimaban un poco, pero decid√≠ arriesgarme y estoy muy contento y satisfecho con la compra, 100% recomendado!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo, al principio dude mucho en comprar usado ya que he le√≠do algunas rese√±as malas y otras buenas, en mi caso el equipo que me lleg√≥ no ha presentado problemas (3 meses de uso).Llego bastante bien empacando, sin rayaduras, sin golpes, el tel√©fono estaba bastante bueno.Claro que se paga un poco m√°s por Amazon pero est√°s pagando SEGURIDAD y CALIDAD, cada tel√©fono viene con una tarjeta de inspecci√≥n llenada a mano sobre alguien que inspeccion√≥ y limpio el tel√©fono.Llego con el 90% de la capacidad de bater√≠a que promete la publicaci√≥n y no he tenido temas que laPila no dure o que se caliente el tel√©fono.Si est√°s dudando en si confiar o no en Amazon Renewed usa esta rese√±a como una evidencia que cumple con lo que promete y tienes la ventaja de regresarlo si no cumple con tus expectativas o con la descripci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in pretty much 2 days! seller shipped the phone immediately and it got to me with no issues. Phone was wrapped very well inside the box.So far everything in the phone works perfectly fine.I'm slightly disappointed in the battery health, was anticipating a minimum of 85% but this one was 84%. My other iphone 11 I've had for over a year (I bought renewed as well), is currently at 86%. But that's my only let down. I belive the listing says between 80-100..I can't remember.I'll update if the phone gives issues, but so far everything works perfectly fine. And for the price I paid, I thought it was way to good to be true. As of 2022, I paid 750 (no tax either) for a 256gb iphone 11 PRO MAX! If you're unsure about buying with this seller, I say you take a chance! I'm satisfied with my purchase (so far)Thank you!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en perfecto estado de todo en excepci√≥n de que la bocina de el audio donde contestas las llamadas estaba un poco sucia pero la lleve a que le hicieran limpieza general a todo el dispositivo y quedo en perfecto estado, me llego con un 94% de bater√≠a es el 3 aparato que compro renovado y no he tenido problema alguno con ninguno de ellos"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno pues el producto me llego en buenas condiciones pero en la parte dela bocina , se ve un poco rallado pero con una funda no se nota , del prosesador esta muy bien me llego con el 87% de pila y llevo ya 3 dias usandolo y esta bien. lo bueno que se tiene 90 dias de garantia"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El costo- beneficio del producto es bueno siempre y cuando funcione"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente equip√≥, el √∫nico pero es la vida de la Bater√≠a, lleg√≥ en un 84% de ah√≠ ning√∫n detalle."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Sabemos que un tel√©fono reacondicionado puede traer algunos detalles, pero igual esperamos que sean menores y que valga la pena lo que estamos pagando. No se si en las fotos se alcanzar√° a apreciar pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con un golpe importante en una esquina y varios rallones profundos en la pantalla, por lo que decid√≠ que lo voy a regresar."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono es bueno cumple con todas las funciones y la bater√≠a al 90% como lo menciona en la descripci√≥n solo que Tengo dos meses con el y el cargador ya no funciona ninguno de los doscable ni el cuadrito de la corriente, en el producto si especifica que el producto como es refurbished no contiene accesorios originales pero que Amazon revisa que los accesorios Sean de calidad, lamentablemente el cargador del tel√©fono que compr√© no funcion√≥ y lo peor es que la compra no me da opci√≥n de reportarlo. Siento que para este tipo de productos Amazon deber√≠a de verificar mejor la calidad de los accesorios que mandan"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular excelente en mi caso la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 100%, muy peque√±os detalles en la parte superior pero casi imperceptible lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ten√≠a mis dudas al momento de comprarlo el equipo est√° en un 99 de est√©tica lo √∫nico malo fue que la bater√≠a llego al 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto lleg√≥ sin problema alguno. Al abrirlo me di cuenta que est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo. El cargador no es original (que te lo avisan desde la compra) pero el problema es que no es compatible el voltaje y no logra cargarlo de forma correcta, incluso podr√≠a da√±arlo ya que se calent√≥.Si tienes un cargador nuevo de alg√∫n iPhone anterior es mejor que lo uses.Fuera de eso, es una gran compra y me quedo satisfecho."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cable cargador no funciona"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Happy with it"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! Gave it thought for a couple months was a toss-up between Walmart Amazon and Best-Buy. Best-Buy apparently is a rip off and Walmart warranty wasn't as good! Bought and as stated was like new battery life is at 90% no scratches or dents and came with a new screen protector. Thought i would wait a couple months before posting a review and i,m impressed! Sure a lot cheaper at 949.00 than having bought it new a year ago! Well worth the purchase and would recommend to a friend!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al inicio estaba algo cr√©dulo, muchos otros usuarios comentan el que les han llegado equipos con el 90% al 99% de bater√≠a en mi caso no fue as√≠, si no que ah llegado con un 100% pero, toda la pantalla esta con micro rayas, al igual que los lentes de la c√°mara, es decir de lejos si se logra apreciar que esta muy rayad mas cuando la luz le da directamente, espero poder solucionar lo aplicando una mica, pero de lo dem√°s me estoy muy conforme hasta ahora las fotograf√≠as no eh tenido problema pensando que tambi√©n los lentes est√°n demasiado rayados, no culpo a su anterior due√±o el hecho de no ponerle alg√∫n protector al final es el gusto de cada persona y por eso baja el precio del equipo.Al final de todo, esto es como una ruleta que la suerte nos tocara un buen equipo como uno malo.Si tienen la oportunidad c√≥mprenlo la garant√≠a de Amazon responde muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes de la fecha estimada. Fue una sorpresa completamente. No pod√≠a con las ansias. Lleg√≥ con 90% de capacidad, algo menor de lo que hab√≠a esperado. Trae incluido un cargador gen√©rico, pero que funciona bien y un pincito para sacar el chip, nada m√°s. Mica incluida, pero que tiene dos marcas circulares que no tengo idea de d√≥nde salieron, aunque s√≥lo se ven a contra luz.El equipo funciona bien, una funda es extremadamente necesaria porque es muy resbaloso sin una, a veces como que se tarda en agarrar la conexi√≥n celular, pero s√≥lo es cuesti√≥n de esperar. Lentes en buenas condiciones, c√°mara funcional, flash funciona bien, bocinas funcionan bien, botones funcionan bien. Ya lo dem√°s son quejas que tengo del sistema y del tama√±o de pantalla, pero nada que ver con el servicio de amazon. En resumen, lo compr√© porque hab√≠a una promoci√≥n bancaria, y estuve busc√°ndolo varios d√≠as porque a veces costaba casi 1000 pesos menos, no s√© qu√© factores hay para que ocurran estos cambios de precio, lo √∫nico que s√© es que 18K es demasiado. La bater√≠a s√≠ le dura, aunque no es extraordinaria, no esperar√≠a menos del ‚ÄúiPhone con mejor bater√≠a‚Äù, c√°mara muy buena y la experiencia Apple en todo su esplendor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones, hay un inconveniente tengo inconsistencias en la red y desafortunadamente es solo compatible con la red de AT&T si fuera compatible con todas las compa√±√≠as en M√©xico estar√≠a perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","llego muy rapido el equipo estaba impecable solo el auricular o bocina se escuchaba muy mal tuve que regresarlo, al igual llegando mi devolucion lo volvere a pedir espero que ahora si venga todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Charger is not an authentic Apple version.Was not in the original Apple box."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le doy 4 estrellas por que la pantalla vino muy muy rayada, solo de d√≠a de vez en cuando interfiere la visibilidad, de resto el celular funciona muy bien y cumple, por necesidad no lo regrese, pero si puedes no aceptes uno con rayaduras, es mejor cambiarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llego bien, la pantalla un poco rallada la verdad es que no est√° mal a√∫n que si esperaba un tel√©fono con una condici√≥n de bater√≠a mayor ya que el precio de 12 mil pues si es algo elevado, me llego con 87% de todo lo dem√°s bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buena est√©tica."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Salvo por un peque√±isimo ray√≥n en el lado derecho el tel√©fono es espectacular! Ten√≠a un iphone 6 s y ya no aguantaba jaja, el upgrade fue buen√≠simo, ven√≠a con cargador gen√©rico pero carga en 2 horas y le puedo dar f√°cilmente 12 horas de uso continuo. La pila llegando estaba al 90%, me esper√© meses para escribir esta rese√±a y ¬°la pila sigue estando en 90%! Eso si, no lo utilizo cuando esta cargando para nada. Ven√≠a ya con protector para la parte de enfrente y de atr√°s, as√≠ que lo pude comenzar a utilizar sin miedo de que se rayara (solo tiene una mica delgada, pero hace el trabajo), en general muy buen producto!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En buenas condiciones generales, pila al 90% un ligero rasp√≥n en la pantalla, fuera de eso bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update: the seller of this phone is truly dismal as far as warranty goes. They refused all contact, did not offer any customer support or anything to help fix my phone, not even a new screen protector! The return date has passed and I regret not returning it. It was a desperate purchase and I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. The warranty is non-existent, customer support also, non-existent. Changing to 1 starThe phone works and I REALLY needed a phone, so I kept it. It seems like the prices keep going up! But, I was under the impression that the phone was completely refurbished and ‚Äòlike new‚Äô condition.It came with two noticeable cracks at the top of the screen, fortunately they don‚Äôt effect most of the screen and they don‚Äôt go across the camera.The battery doesn‚Äôt charge past 54% even when I use it plugged in, it just doesn‚Äôt work.It worries me a lot for how long my phone will work for the future and it‚Äôs extremely disappointing.If I had any choice I would not have kept it but my old iPhone had died and I was desperate. It had a few problems connecting but it worked and once it connected, all my pics and vids, contacts etc came back (yay!).I contacted the company, they asked for pics of all the sides of the phone (which was kind of weird) but then they never replied back.It was very disappointing and a real lapse of customer service. They definitely don‚Äôt offer any assistance with warranty or advice about what to do with product problems.It was quite the dropped ball and if you have an option for another phone, go for that one. I don‚Äôt have any confidence in how long this one will last and zero confidence in their ability to refurbish or honor their warranties."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was hesitant to buy a refurbished iphone but except for the box and some new offbrand charging cords/ear phones, it is in perfect working order and looks/operates like it is fresh out of the store.4 out of 5 for the value because phones are too expensive across all brands.. my god.This was a solid purchase though."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una buena compra, me lleg√≥ con 94% de bater√≠a en excelentes condiciones, sin ralladuras, ni defectos. Llevo 4 meses con √©l y funciona correctamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo √∫nico ‚Äúmalo‚Äù ser√≠a el cargador gen√©rico con el que viene ya que carga demasiado lento. Pero bueno, es reacondicionado, ni Apple te lo da con cargador jaja. Fuera de eso, est√©ticamente y funcionalmente lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y con una condici√≥n de bater√≠a en 91%. Todo excelente y sin ning√∫n inconveniente, incluso hasta lleg√≥ 3 d√≠as despu√©s de realizar mi compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone me lleg√≥ sin ning√∫n problema cosm√©tico aparente y con bater√≠a del 93%, cargador gen√©rico de buena calidad. Satisfecha con mi compra!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si tuviera un poco m√°s la vida de la bater√≠a de lo mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, nunca hab√≠a tenido un Iphone, tenia mi desconfianza si comprarlo, pero ya despu√©s de un mes vi√©ndolo llego en perfectas condiciones, claro trae cargador gen√©rico no iba a llegar con el original, aunque puedes comprar el original por separado despu√©s, la pantalla est√° muy bien y el tel√©fono no tiene ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, solo tengan cuidado es muy ligero y resbaladizo recomiendo comprar alguna funda y mica para mayor protecci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ped√≠ el celular a la tiende de IVECSA STORE con algo de miedo por leer que mando productos que no eran lo que ped√≠an y en todos el problema era de paqueter√≠a de Amazon me arriesgu√© y lo ped√≠ mi sorpresa fue que mi celular jam√°s a sido abierto esta como de f√°brica √≥sea NO ES REACONDICIONADO, el √∫nico detalle que tiene es unos m√≠nimos rayones en la pantalla que con la mica no se ven, estoy muy contento con mi compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene muy bien empacando, ven√≠a con cristal templado al quit√°rselo ten√≠a unos raspones en la pantalla de la parte superior derecha no afecta en nada, todo lo dem√°s est√° muy bien cuidado el celular, bateria un 88%, lo he estado usando casi 14 d√≠as y va muy bien, hasta ahora nada de fallos y si busca un iPhone este es el indicador calidad precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno el equipo, no tengo problemas con el, llevo una semana us√°ndolo y parece estar en √≥ptimas condiciones. Trae detalles est√©ticos como rayones en la pantalla y en una de las c√°maras. Bater√≠a viene al 88% y creo que de ah√≠ en fuera est√° bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio por un iPhone en buenas condiciones.Detalladamente agregar√© lo siguiente: el tel√©fono fue recibido en buenas condiciones de embalaje , al abrir la caja te encuentras una caja gen√©rica sellada , dentro el iPhone, cargador y cable , est√©ticamente el tel√©fono estaba en excelentes condiciones casi inmaculado dir√≠a yo , con algunos peque√±os rayoncitos en el marco del tel√©fono sin embargo me lleve la sorpresa qu√© al retirar el cristal templado qu√© ya viene instalado al llegar el iPhone , con rayones muy notorios y profundos en toda la pantalla, que llegan a restar mucho a la est√©tica general del equipo , hab√≠a le√≠do qu√© estos iPhone ya tra√≠an ese cristal templado instalado para precisamente cubrir esos rayones y que pasen desapercibidos, y puedo confirmar que es cierto .Bater√≠a llego en 92 % , bocinas, micr√≥fonos y c√°maras funcionando perfectamente, viene liberado , si embargo no funciona con redes Altan .Sin embargo pasados unos d√≠as, comenc√© a notar qu√© en la parte inferior trasera del tel√©fono apreci√≥ una peque√±a abertura qu√© me hacia dudar si el tel√©fono estaba bien sellado y ante la incertidumbre de pensar que pudiera hacerse m√°s grande decid√≠ regresar el tel√©fono.En general recomendar√≠a este tel√©fono si quieres un iPhone a bajo costo, sin embargo tendr√°s que conformarte con los peque√±os detalles que pudieran aparecer con el paso del tiempo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve duda de comprarlo pero al final llego con est√©tica de 10 y con bater√≠a de 84"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bater√≠a al 80%Al leer otras rese√±as ten√≠a expectativas muy altasPens√© que en verdad est√©ticamente se ver√≠a divinoPero en la parte frontal de la pantalla arriba de la cara est√° como raspado o como si fuera defecto al poner de nuevo la pantallaLigeros tallones que no se ven en la orden dorada del marco por el cargadorHasta ahora me funciona bien tengo poco con el actualizo despu√©sSiento que me cost√≥ un poco m√°s que si comprara uno de uso del mismo modelo por otro ladoEs mi primer iPhone desde el iPhone 4 siempre hab√≠a usado Samsung, pens√© que me decpcionariaPero la verdad es que est√° muy bien en cuanto funciones el dual sim jam√°s funciono no entra el chip as√≠ que lo uso como uni sim"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cargador con el que lo enviaron dej√≥ de funcionar dos semanas despu√©s. Pero en si, el tel√©fono funciona muy bien y no ten√≠a ning√∫n detalle est√©tico."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La pantalla lleg√≥ rayada y con golpes"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente calidad y precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 3 d√≠as con el est√° funcionando al 100% nomas que llego con unos pocos rayones en la pantalla, no afectan y con la bater√≠a al 87%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Quede muy satisfecho con el producto, pr√°cticamente pareciera que es nuevo, solo tiene un muy ligero rasp√≥n en la parte superior pero causado por el case de ah√≠ en fuera la pantalla impecable y el funcionamiento muy bueno. Ten√≠a mis dudas de comprar por algunos comentarios, pero al final fue una buena decisi√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es Original, al principio pens√© que la antena estaba da√±ada, despu√©s me di cuenta que estaba poniendo al rev√©s el SIM, las condiciones del equipo son muy buenas, la bater√≠a tiene 100% de retenci√≥n de carga, aunque la pantalla viene demasiado rayada y algunas muy profundas y muy notorias"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad tenia algo de miedo leyendo algunos de los comentarios menos favorables. Pero me anime ya que vi que se podr√≠an hacer devoluciones y que se tenia buena comunicaci√≥n con el vendedor. El producto me llego en una caja x, y con un adaptador de corriente x como bien lo dicen en la publicaci√≥n. El iPhone llego nuevecito y al prenderlo llego casi al 100% de bater√≠a y con la nueva actualizaci√≥n no me lleve ninguna sorpresa para mal.Dure adem√°s varios d√≠as esperando ya que manejan meses sin intereses pero creo debe uno estar atento para cuando los ponen ya que solo duran unos d√≠as y luego sin meses y luego vuelven."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto ven√≠a como nuevo con 95% de bater√≠a, solo algunos raspones en el area de alrededor de las c√°maras pero nada que afecte en su funcionamiento, el celular funciono con mi compa√±√≠a celular y en general no tengo ning√∫n pero, como si lo hubiera comprado nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone lleg√≥ en una excelente condici√≥n , est√©tica 9/10, ligeras marcas de uso en los marcos que solamente se aprecian si observas muy de cerca.La pantalla muy bien, inclu√≠a una mica, al removerla se observan ligeras marcas de uso en la pantalla que √∫nicamente son apreciables sin la mica y solo si observas muy de cerca y con una luz fuerte.La parte trasera y la c√°mara est√°n impecables, ni un solo ray√≥n ni una sola marca de uso.La bater√≠a llego al 96%C√≥mo es de esperarse llego en una caja gen√©rica con cable y cargadores gen√©ricos pero no es problema por que f√°cilmente puedes comprar los oficiales de Apple.En general muy satisfecho, es buena opci√≥n para conseguir un dispositivo de este tipo y ahorra un poco de dinero"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone que me lleg√≥ viene en excelentes condiciones lo he probado varios d√≠as y no tengo queja la bater√≠a estaba al 100% y muy bien cuidado!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","la verdad el equipo llego en excelentes condiciones, sin ning√∫n tipo de detalles y funcionando perfectamente.no teman a comprar productos reacondicionados, la verdad est√°n muy bien y a un excelente precio."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compr√© mi iPhone 11 pro max de 256 gb con un poco de temor. Evidentemente el producto es un equipo ¬´seminuevo¬ª o como dice el vendedor ¬´renewed¬ª. Sin embargo, mi sorpresa fue que me lleg√≥ un tel√©fono en muy buenas condiciones. La bater√≠a al 93% y con una est√©tica my buena. La pantalla vino con un cristal templado pre-instalado, que al cambiarlo por otro, me pude percatar que la pantalla tiene algunos peque√±os rayones, pero nada que impida disfrutar del tel√©fono. Lo que si hay que decir, el cargador (cubo) es una burla, de muy mala calidad, lo √∫nico rescatable fue el cable lightning. No tuve mucho problema, por que lo cargo con el cargador de mi iPad (20w) lo que hace que funcione la carga r√°pida.Estoy por cumplir un mes con el equipo, si tuviera un comentario adicional, actualizo mi rese√±a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues with the phone, battery life is as expected more high engery applications used drain the battery. On everyday things like telephone and text messages it will last all day. I'd certainly buy another phone from Amazon"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buen producto me llego como nuevo y tiene muy buen funcionamiento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bater√≠a 84%Est√©tica solo ten√≠a un rasgu√±o en el marcoTodo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was a bit nervous to order a refurbished phone for all the obvious reasons but a 90 day return policy gave me confidence to try. The phone arrived in a plain box, well packaged. It was immaculate, no marks and battery life was good. I would consider buying another refurbished phone in the future."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es un buen telefono, sin da√±os, la bocina se escucha muy bien, pero al recibirlo no traia cargador y menciona que si venia incluido, necesito investigar como reportarlo al proveedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice budget iPhone 11 pro max and that too with 92% battery capacity left."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto en general viene muy bien, no da√±ado ni maltratado, no rasgu√±os la capacidad de la bater√≠a es de 92% lo √∫nico malo es que la pantalla no es la original de apple; se nota en la calidad de los colores"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tiene muchas funcionalidades y se pueden aprovechar al maximo. El dise√±o y colir increinle"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El env√≠o fue rapid√≠simo, mas que en otras compras que eh realizado, el producto la verdad supero mis expectativas por mucho, muy buena compra realmente, no tenia o al menos no le note ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, la vida de la bater√≠a llego al 85% pero me rinde mejor que otro que tenia con vida de 90%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el color el servicio lo importante es funcional y te ahorras muchos pesos la est√©tica me sali√≥ 9/10 que es genial por el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ en perfecto estado, bater√≠a al 100% ning√∫n ray√≥n o golpe es como si fuera nuevo, recomiendo totalmente al vendedor ivecsa store ; anteriormente hab√≠a comprado uno de buyspry en color plata pero llego rayado del marco y con una abolladura cerca de la c√°mara que le dej√≥ una marca como ‚Äúburbuja‚Äù en el cristal , ese mismo d√≠a ped√≠ la devoluci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular me llego con una calidad impecable, pr√°cticamente como nuevo ning√∫n da√±o f√≠sico ni raspadura en pantalla.Bater√≠a al 90Lo he usado casi el mes y sin problemasEstoy muy satisfecho con la compraCargador y cable de buena calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve mis dudas antes de comprarlo, pero estoy mas que satisfecho con el estado del tel√©fono. Pr√°cticamente es un equipo nuevo. Y lo que me animo al final fue el respaldo de Amazon. No ser√° el √∫ltimo que compre en Renewed. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüéâ"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ con 87 de bater√≠a pero la verdad es que ni se nota , la bater√≠a me dura todo el d√≠a.Ven√≠a con cargador gen√©rico pero no se ha calentado ni nada extra√±o."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pues la verdad quede muy contenta con mi compra. Llego al otro d√≠a de mi pago, ven√≠a en una caja sencilla pero bien protegido, tra√≠a una mica de cristal y un proyector de pl√°stico, tra√≠a la herramientita para abrir el porta chip, el cargador si se ve medio chafa jaja pero pues ah√≠ dec√≠a que gen√©rico y cumple su funci√≥n, ven√≠a con la bater√≠a al 97%, si viene liberado, le puse chip Telcel en Mexico y esta todo en orden, Llevo us√°ndolo 3 d√≠as y estoy s√∫per contenta, me lo regale de cumplea√±os. La verdad quer√≠a comprarlo por otro lado pero pues si era mucho dinero y pues tem√≠a que me robaran, entonces me decid√≠ por Amazon ya que promete garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as y devuelven todo el dinero, entonces por eso confi√©, ojal√° no falle el celular, pero la verdad viene casi como nuevo, solo tiene 2 mini rasgu√±itos casi imperceptibles en una orilla de la pantalla, as√≠ que no creo que le pase nada."

I was suprised the phone was perfect :) now i can see why those people are thinking the 5 star reviews are fake and in my experience the phone is mint, nonproblems and I popped in my bell sim card and worked perfect.. I did a full exam on the phone and everything works like new, only regret is not getting 512 gb version because it was only $10 more but I don't think I'll need all those gigs anyway"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Este producto vino muy bien a la excepcion de de un detalle. Al momento de usar la camara del telefono este empieza a hacer ruido y la camara vibra. Esto no permite tomar fotos ni videos adecuadamente."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono me lleg√≥ con el 86% de vida √∫til de la bater√≠a, est√©ticamente esta perfecto excepto una esquina de la pantalla que tiene rayado como cuando traes el tel√©fono y tambi√©n las llaves y se va rayando con el movimiento, eso no me gusto porque he tenido iPhone por a√±os y nunca se me han rayado as√≠, no afecta en su funcionamiento y todo internamente funciona bien"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En general esta en buen estado, 85% de bater√≠a al llegar, funciona bien pero al poco tiempo comenz√≥ a trabarse, a tener peque√±as fallas que se presentaron cada vez de forma m√°s frecuente.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pondr√≠a 5 estrellas pero la pantalla tra√≠a unas ligeras rayas. Lo bueno es que ya con la mica de hidrogel mate no se notan. Estuve a punto de devolverlo pero finalmente me lo qued√© y funciona bien. Solo eso, las rayas en la pantalla."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es mi primera compra en Amazon Renewed, BuySpry sigan vendiendo iphones en este estado y volver√© a comprar con ustedes. Mi iphone 11 pro m√°x lleg√≥ en excelente estado f√≠sico y operativo pila al 91% llevo un d√≠a con el y al momento no ha fallado, espero siga as√≠. Productos con excelente est√©tica y funcionamiento correcto no tienen porque ser devueltos. El vendedor resuelve muy r√°pido los cuestionamientos."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm very happy with this phone so far, mine came with no scratches, battery at 97%, a screen and lens film protectors already installed. The charger was not Apple, but I'm using one I had from an older iPhone. From all the sellers, I picked one here in Canada with overnight shipping -- this one came from ""Westend Enterprises Inc"", and fullfilled by Amazon. I didn't want to take any chances with those shipped from the States."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tel√©fono de muy baja calidad, b√°sicamente dir√© que es una porquer√≠a, para lo que cuesta hay mejor opci√≥n! Esta s√∫per reacondicionado y tiene piezas gen√©ricas (piratas)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en excelentes condiciones, tenia dudas sobre todo con la pila porque habia comentarios buenos y algunos malos, pero esta muy bonito traia una estetica de 9.9 la pila estaba al 100, llego en caja que generica con cargador igual, pero lo uso con otro que ya tenia y esta muy bien la carga le dura mucho mas que al SE 2020 definitivamente lo volveria a comprar solo hay que revisar el vendedor, se anuncian muchos pero no todos tienen buenos comentarios algunos ni siquiera los envian."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo est√° como nuevo, su est√©tica podr√≠a decirse perfecta; bater√≠a al 96% y hasta el momento funciona muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Three months ago, I bought this white iPhone 11 Pro Max, when I got it, I felt so excited, it was like brand new, no scratch, battery life was 97%, so great! I love it so much! But after 3 months later, now the battery life is only 88%, it dropped down so fast, not usual. I asked my friend, she bought iPhone 12 last year, Black Friday, until now, still 100% battery life, so jealous of her. Anyway, I love iPhone, but this made me disappointed. Maybe I was bad luck. :("
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ten√≠a mis dudas por ser un equipo reacondicionado, lleg√≥ justo a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones.
Como nuevo ya con mica en la pantalla, cargador y cable.
Recomiendo mucho comprar en BUYSPRY"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lo compre hace un par de d√≠as por que me anime a cambiarme a iPhone y quer√≠a algo ""nuevo"" el tel√©fono venia con una mica cristal impecable al igual que la pantalla y la parte trasera del tel√©fono pero la parte de los lados parec√≠a que se la hab√≠an metido por el culo al anterior due√±o estaba muy rayado hasta al punto en que pens√© que le hab√≠an pasado una lija y seamos honestos obvio que por el precio vale la versi√≥n del tel√©fono pero no creo que valga la pena pagar 17k o 15k para que este tan rayado y parezca que lo arrastraron por el piso, se que me dir√°n que mientras el dispositivo sirva no importa lo dem√°s pero si en alg√∫n momento lo quieres vender eso le bajara valor al producto por que ya esta rayado al igual que la bater√≠a no venia tan mal contaba con 89% de uso :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta rese√±a la escribo despues de un tiempo de uso, el equipo lleg√≥ bien sin rayones aparentes con mica, retire la mica y ten√≠a rayones de uso, esto personalmente no me molest√≥ lo que si no me gusto y termin√≥ en devoluci√≥n fue la degradaci√≥n r√°pida de la bater√≠a, me llego con un 98% y en menos de un mes se fue a 96, luego 94 y en dos meses y medio ten√≠a 90% hice la calibraci√≥n y quedo en el mismo porcentaje adem√°s de ser notorio al uso, nunca lo us√© mientras se cargaba y usaba un cargador apple que yo tengo que no es carga r√°pida (he tenido y tengo productos apple) asi que no le di mal usl que el normal sin jugar juegos pesados (jam√°s se calent√≥) supongo sali√≥ mal la pila... No creo que sea asi en todos los renovados as√≠ que si los recomiendo pero chequenlos muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week because my old iPhone 6S was on its way out. It arrived on Sunday, and I was worried that it wasn‚Äôt going to be as advertised. When I opened the box and saw the phone, I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs in nearly perfect condition, with very few unnoticeable scratches at the top. The battery health is at 100% and it lasts a long time without needing a charge. I cannot express how thrilled I am with this purchase, and I am very happy that I decided to buy it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got mine today, product is brand new, was wrapped, came with charger etc... Did not come in original box, but who cares. The only issue is that when I insert the SIM card the carrier is detected but not active, try resetting network settings, SIM port looks very clean and tried with 2 SIM cards with 2 different Canadian carriers. I think the phone is still locked with the previous carrier (my opinion) I have sent an email to the seller and awaiting an answer. This is my reason for 2 stars cause product is not working as expected. But will change depending on resolutions."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre este tel√©fono para mi uso diario y quede muy contento, ya era la segunda vez que compro as√≠ un dispositivo y realmente me a encantado como llega el dispositivo, sin rayones, la pantalla en perfecta condici√≥n, su bater√≠a con una alto porcentaje de vida a√∫n, muy contento la verdad. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No llevo los 3 meses y se prende y se apaga, me podr√≠an apoyar en c√≥mo podr√≠a hacer el cambio o reembolso? Por favor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo en bater√≠a tiene una integridad del 100%, la carcasa est√° en perfectas condiciones sin el m√≠nimo ray√≥n o golpe, pero la pantalla s√≠ se encontraba con muchos rayones ocasionados por llaves o herramientas, inclusive uno de ellos est√° profundo justo en la posici√≥n del lente en la c√°mara frontal. En ciertos √°ngulos la luz se ve un m√≠nimo reflejada por el ray√≥n. No afecta su funcionamiento y con una mica de cristal o hidrogel se cubren los rayones. El cargador y cable son gen√©ricos y la caja a su vez es gen√©rica de buena calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, el Face ID fall√≥ como a los 2 meses pero todo en orden"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo un mes con el equipo llego bien una buena est√©tica , bater√≠a del 86% hasta el momento sin fallas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en s√∫per buenas condiciones, sin ning√∫n detalle y la bater√≠a arriba del 90%. S√∫per satisfecho con mi compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me la rif√© leyendo varios comentarios que unos equipos no jalaban bien o despues de unos dias no tenia se√±al pero la verdad el que me mandaron esta casi nuevo. Y tiene 100% de vida la pila. Tengo casi 2 semanas de usarlo y asta ahorita jala bien. Solo un dia que sali si tenia se√±al pero no entravan ni salian llamadas ni datos. Pero solo me meti ala pagina d mitelcel(tengo telcel) y lo registre como decia un papelito que venia con el cell. Nose si fue por eso o de plano se callo la red por un momento. t√≠pico Telcel siemple que se batala cuando llueve o esta bien nublado. Ensi no se si pueda recomendarlo tomando encuenta los otros compradores y no todos los ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù estan identicos. Aveses asta los nuevos salen fallando de la fabrica pero lo bueno que ai siempre te daran otro nuevo. Aqui te ariesgas ala condicion que lo maden. üòÖ
Lo bueno que tienen un mes si no vale la pena"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llego en caja gen√©rica y cargador gen√©rico funcional, la capacidad de bater√≠a llego en 86% , detalles est√©ticos casi nulos, la bocina se escucha un poco mal, distorsionada en volumen algo, si sale otro detalle me plantear√© el devolverlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo en perfecto estado, me encanto.
Cargador de buena vista, cable de 3 pies, buenos acabados.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo regrese porque no cumpl√≠a con los est√°ndares que comenta la publicaci√≥n. Mala calidad, no parece nuevo y el estado de la bater√≠a estaba en 79%. Realice la devoluci√≥n y el comprador muy buena atenci√≥n me hicieron el reembolso cuando revieron mi art√≠culo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fue mi primera experiencia comprando renewed y mi iPhone lleg√≥ impecable! Obvio no lleg√≥ en su caja original ni accesorios originales pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con el 100% de bater√≠a y hasta con mica para la pantalla. Lo √∫nico que me qued√≥ ligeramente insatisfecho es que el cable que ven√≠a no tiene informaci√≥n que corrobore que es MFI pero fuera de eso, llega empaquetado super bien. Si le vuelvo a comprar a Buyspry!
Cabe resaltar que lo compr√© por Abril y para Octubre sigue totalmente funcional."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compr√© este celular el 23 de Junio del 2021
Hago este comentario el 19 de Septiembre casi 3 meses de usarlo, hasta el momento todo muy bien, sin ning√∫n detalle grave de uso o da√±o, solo trae dos ralloncitos en la pantalla, nada que disguste.
Defin√≠ no viene con cargador, ni caja original pero la verdad que no pasa nada, el cargador funciona mucho m√°s r√°pido que el de mi iPad. As√≠ que te evitas gastarte m√°s dinero por un original.
Hasta el momento pienso que fue una muy buena compra.
Saludos!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ bien, tal cual dice la publicaci√≥n, equipo seminuevo, vida de la bater√≠a 82%, equipo con Mica en la pantalla, cargador y usb gen√©rico, y todo funcionando a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estetica de 10, pero al probarlo unos dias, no tarda nada , tiene 82% de batera, ya tiene 12 dias que lo devolv√≠ y no me dan mi reembolso, pesimo servicio."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone would constantly cut internet and phone calls. Brought it in and was told that antenna was probably damaged. I returned it with no issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo funciona y opera correctamente conforme a especificaciones del fabricante. Sin embargo, aunque se especifica claramente su condici√≥n de reacondicionado, el equipo lleg√≥ con una mica de cristal pegada a la pantalla, con lo cual se minimiza unas muy leves ralladuras. A lo mejor valdr√≠a la pena publicar im√°genes de los productos reales para los casos de reacondicionados, en vez de im√°genes de cat√°logo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo he usado ya por un mes, esta en excelentes condiciones, llego con 91% de bateria, es suerte, pedi otros dos y llegaron con 86 y 81, los devolvi y al tercero llego otro del 90%, es cuestion de arriesgarse pero todo excelente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relaci√≥n CALIDAD PRECIO es aceptable , la bater√≠a est√° al 90% ( lleg√≥ con el 91 hace un mes ) , pero siendo un iPhone ya es conocido que as√≠ es la cosa , tengo que mencionar que me lleve un susto cuando quise al empezar a respaldar el celular a este nuevo ME APAREC√çA EL ANTERIOR DUE√ëO DEL APARATO , yo cre√≠ que estaba totalmente borrado , o su no se si sea parte del funcionamiento , la cosa es que hoy mi celular est√° funcionando AL 100% en todas sus cosas sin nada raro , ( que bueno todos los iPhones que he tenido siempre tienen repentinamente alg√∫n completamiento extra√±o por alg√∫n momento ) que le atribuyo al IOS de Apple ... LO RECOMIENDO , por cierto todo en tiempo y forma .üëçüèº"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 mes con el desde septiembre , Lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones, como nuevo est√©ticamente solo la bater√≠a lleg√≥ en 89% y en 1 mes baj√≥ a 86% pero creo que es por el cargador se tiene que comprar el original, todo lo dem√°s va bien, todas las piezas que tiene son originales"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me lleg√≥ un iPhone original en muy buen estado el √∫nico detalle fue la pantalla que estaba muy rayada pero con la mica ya no se le ven las marcas hasta ahora todo bien y la bater√≠a llego al 88 porciento"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre el equipo y todo iba perfecto hasta que me di cuenta que se calentaba, a veces lo hac√≠a cuando ve√≠a Facebook o instagram, pasaba en momentos completamente aleatorios. A veces se calentaba demasiado y solo se enfr√≠aba hasta que lo apagaba, sin duda tuve que devolverlo por miedo a que la bater√≠a empeorar√° muy r√°pido por esto mismo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° como nuevo y funciona perfecto, sin golpes ni rayones. El √∫nico detalle que yo mencionar√≠a es que la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° al 85%, yo esperaba al menos arriba de 90%, pero bueno la descripci√≥n del producto lo advierte."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego a tiempo, todo bien hasta ahorita y la bater√≠a me llego a 86 para el precio eso no me agrada tanto:/"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ con est√©tica de 10 y 97 en la bater√≠a.
Apenas llevo 4 d√≠as de uso y todo perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En realidad, m√°s que venderte un producto renovado por alg√∫n detalle, lo que te venden es un producto de segunda mano. En mi caso, el equipo incluso viene con una mica protectora y en los bordes se nota algo de suciedad, es decir, ni siquiera lo limpiaron. Por otro lado, la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a es de un 85% (vida √∫til promedio de los equipos que amigos o conocidos tienen actualmente y que adquirieron cuando el producto sali√≥ al mercado)."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encant√≥ todo, parece nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n detalle, la bater√≠a al 100% solo por el cargador y la caja que no son originales, pero el equipo sin duda una maravilla, la mejor compra que pude haber hecho, gracias al vendedor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","First week i was super happy with my phone. But now its been two months or so, and i have realized a bunch of flaws which you guys should be aware of

Firstly, my phones actual screen isn‚Äôt authentic. Its very obviously third party. Has a weird feel, doesnt operate as smoothly as an original would

Second of all, the battery is third party as well. Iphones are advertised as fast charge, up to 50% charge within first 30 mins. I spent 50-100$ on a fast charge cable and charging block from Anker. The phone charges superrrr slow. Takes well over an hour to even reach 50% charge.

And i have to constantly turn phone on airplane mode, and turn it back off. Because the phones internet/services stop working multiple times per day. Ive had 5+ iphones in my life, never ever encountered this before.

There are other things too but i dont wana make this review an essay. I highly do not recommend buying from this supplier. Truly disappointed with the product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenia mis dudas de comprar un producto usado, mas al hablar de algo como un iPhone, pero el celular me llego en tres d√≠as, pr√°cticamente esta nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n defecto , la bater√≠a al 100%.
Creo que realize una excelente compra puesto que al compara el precio de uno nuevo con este usado hay mucha diferencia y en lo que respecta a calidad y est√©tica en el usado, pr√°cticamente ninguna. Volver√≠a a comprar."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cel est√° es buenas condiciones est√©ticas, funciona muy bien, viene con cargador gen√©rico, la bater√≠a tiene muy buen estado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, solo que no mencionaron que ten√≠a una falla en el Face ID, sab√≠a que no compraba un celular nuevo, pero una herramienta as√≠ ese esencial en el tel√©fono hay que mencionarlas, por lo dem√°s quedo satisfecho."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular es de lo mejor que he tenido, la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a es una bestialidad 10/10"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tallado en la esquina Con ligeros detalles exteriores calificaci√≥n 8 de 10"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es lo que esperaba segun la descripcion del producto, tenia una caja generica, bien empacado, cargador (5W) y cable genericos, no incluye audifonos, tegngo usandolo dos semanas y todo bien hasta ahora, ya actualice a 14.5, la pantalla y la parte de atras bien, unas rayas y golpes en las esquinas. Bocina, entradas y camara bien, la maxima capacidad de la bateria estaba en 94%, ahora es 93, solo me decepciono la bateria (por eso las 4 estrellas), en general lo recomendaria."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono llega en condiciones buenas, la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 92% lo √∫nico malo es el cargador dice que es el que debe de llevar pero se ve de muy mala c√°lida al igual que el cable."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","bateria al 88% todo lo demas perfecto como nuevo, si problemas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es la 2da vez que lo pido, la primera venia con 83%de bater√≠a y lo devolv√≠, este vino como nuevo,.y 90% de bater√≠a, lo recomiendo de verdad excelente opci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","muy bueno solo raspones en lo laterales y el cargador es de muy mala calidad, deber√≠a integra uno certificado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto ! Me llego con un 97% de vida de bater√≠a ahora tengo 94 dos meses despu√©s. Pero en lo funcional 10/10 muy bonito como nuevo! Si buscas un tel√©fono por un precio razonable es tu opci√≥n. :)"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La calidad es premium como lo dice el anuncio, solo el pago de env√≠o si es m√°s costoso en esta aplicaci√≥n que en otras"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","93% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Ninguna falla."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","I must say that in the beginning I was worried to buy it, once I received it everything was working like if it‚Äôs brand new and I must say WOW. I highly recommend it if you need a new phone!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le t√©l√©phone est super, j'h√©sitait un peu avant de le prendre ,mais quand je l'ai re√ßu , j'ai vu qu'il est compl√®tement neuf.La couleur est magnifique . Qualit√©-prix parfait,le produits en vaut vraiment la peine ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 d√≠a us√°ndolo, hasta el momento lleg√≥ bien, no tiene ning√∫n detalle, m√°s que unos cuantos rayones en la pantalla, si eres muy exigente, no te lo recomiendo, pero si puedes pasar de unos rayoncitos, es perfecto, 100% recomendado
La bater√≠a llego con el 88%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo pero no viene 3n su empaque original y no tiene el cargador original."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien buen servicio del cliente quien atendi√≥ amablemente una solicitud"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente 91% de bater√≠a sin rayones En pantalla ni en ninguna parte, estoy esperando √∫nicamente la factura y fuera de que el cargador no es original estoy totalmente encantado con que el dispositivo llegara en tan buenas condiciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, con peque√±as marcas de uso, pero nada exagerado..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono ven√≠a con 87% de bater√≠a y est√©tica de 10 no ten√≠a rayones solo que lo env√≠an en caja gen√©rica y cargadores gen√©ricos mi compra fue con clevermex recomendado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","99% de bater√≠a, componentes originales, totalmente impecable, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo compre hace poco pero hasta hoy todo perfectos, se calienta un poco al cargar pero supongo es normal, est√©tica 10, c√°maras 10, todo va muy bien me gusta mucho . Espero siga as√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Porque no se aseguran del correcto funcionamiento de estos equipos renewed? es el segundo que recibo con la misma falla, el primero de plano no se escuchaba y en este caso se escucha muy bajito, obligando a abrir el altavoz para sostener una llamada telefonica, evidentemente esto no siempre es posible.
Necesito que me lo cambien por uno que funcione correctamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se encuentra como si fuera nuevo, no unico es que a mi llego con 86% de pila y el cable y el cubo es gen√©rico, pero en lo demas aspectos lo Recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had some problems with the phone,
First off; the screen protector was cracked when received - I was shocked and thought the screen itself was broken
but I think its only the protector thats cracked.
Second off; the phone did not register to the service provider for a bit
I had to call them to ""activate"" the phone to get it to turn on LTE and stuff otherwise its ok."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno como nuevo solo que enviaron cargador viejo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto me lleg√≥ en menos de 2 dias, estetica 9.8 ya que la bateria contaba con 87%, peque√±os rayones pero nada de que preocuparse. La verdad es muy recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reci√©n tengo una semana con equipo, hasta ahora todo bien. Me hab√≠a quedado bastante atr√°s, ten√≠a un Iphone 6s plus y un 8 Plus, as√≠ que estoy contenta con el cambio. Considerando que s√≥lo me interesan funciones b√°sicas de redes sociales y fotos, estoy satisfecha con la compra. La bater√≠a lleg√≥ con una capacidad m√°xima al 96% lo cual est√° muy razonable por el precio. Actualizo comentarios en un par de meses."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relaci√≥n entre calidad y precio es muy buena, pero debo admitir que el cargador con el que viene el tel√©fono, es gen√©rico y no tiene aud√≠fonos, entonces si hacemos la suma de esos dos art√≠culos es de aproximadamente 3 mil pesos que tienes que agregar al valor final del equipo. Just for your information."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not a single scratch or blemish on the device, product took about 4-5 days coming from Texas to Ontario. Battery life was 87%. Love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","the phone is like new, no scratches, the battery condition is 94%, the camera works great, no bugs and takes great photos, the picture quality is good, the sound is good , the storage capacity is 256 GB as I had chosen and the iPhone is official I am happy with my purchase, the only disappointment is to pay $ 1100 and receive a 5W charger and not an 18W charger for fast charging. I recommend this product"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El precio sigue siendo alto para ser un equipo que se le han cambiado piezas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo esta super bien, funciona perfectamente sin problemas, sin estrellados todo muy bien. Lo unico que deberian tener en cuenta es la pila a mi me vino con el 88% pero me ha estado durando la pila y dia completo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lleg√≥ en caja gen√©rica con un cargador de otra marca pero con el plus que es de carga r√°pida, (cargador que Apple no te d√° cuando compras el tel√©fono por cierto). El tel√©fono est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo con la vida de bater√≠a al 100%. Supongo que es suerte porque √©ste celular lleg√≥ impecable pero tambi√©n compr√© un iPhone xs plata y ese celular lleg√≥ desgastado de los costados, rayas m√≠nimas en la pantalla y bater√≠a al 81%. No s√© de que dependa..."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo excelente me llego con un 89% de bater√≠a sin ning√∫n ray√≥n le quite la mica que trae puesta para ver si trae ara√±azos la pantalla tra√≠a una pero no se ve al ponerle el cristal templado y sin el cristal tienes que buscarla bien al reflejo de la Luz para que se note lo recomiendo totalmente llego con cargador y caja gen√©rica que al final del d√≠a eso no me preocupa debido a que lo cargo con su cargador original"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","will definitely buy again from your guys! 1100 cad plus tax for iPhone 11 Pro Max 512gb! That‚Äôs amazing! And the battery life is 100%! Not sure how but that‚Äôs so great!

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√° perfecto, funciona como nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El √∫nico detalle es que la vida de la pila es muy bajo 85% quedo decepcionado, intente devolver el producto pero no me dej√≥. Primera y √∫ltima vez que compro equipo reacondicionado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es la mejor compra que pude haber hecho, me lleg√≥ con 95 de bater√≠a, impecable, est√©tica de 10, DEFINITIVAMENTE LO VOLVER√çA A COMPRAR"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° perfecto, aunque la primera vez que lo ped√≠ me enviaron unas toallitas h√∫medas y tuve que pedir mi reembolso, la atenci√≥n al cliente por parte de Amazon es perfecta. Lo volv√≠ a comprar y por fin lleg√≥ el producto que ped√≠. El tel√©fono ven√≠a con 93 de bater√≠a pero espero que con las semanas de uso se calibre y aumente. La est√©tica es impecable en mi caso y todo funcionando en orden. S√∫per recomendado, pero para que hagas la compra rastrea el precio m√°s bajo y se paciente!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad me daba desconfianza los equipos refurbished, pero llevo ya un par de semanas con mi equipo y en verdad se siente como nuevo. Lleg√≥ bien, r√°pido, sin conflicto, con muy buena est√©tica. Super recomendado."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En la mica que trae tapa mucho de los rayones que trae la pantalla, lo cambiaria pero ser√°n muchos problemas para la informaci√≥n que ya le met√≠ al tel√©fono, hay que cuidar m√°s la est√©tica de las pantallas de estos tel√©fonos, por qu√© si bien son usados deben de manejar calidad en los mismos."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Apenas llevo una semana de uso, pero el tel√©fono como nuevo totalmente, tanto f√≠sica como funcionalmente. Lo recomiendo mucho, lleg√≥ con 100% de pila, sin ning√∫n detalle f√≠sico y liberado para cualquier compa√±√≠a (yo uso Telcel) tiene Apple care vigente de un mes a partir de la entrega (al menos as√≠ fue en mi caso)."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se entiende que sea un producto reacondicionado y no es totalmente nuevo, pero al menos en mi caso, me lleg√≥ con una pantalla con bastantes rayones peque√±os (el anterior due√±o seguro lo dejaba con la pantalla en el suelo) y en la descripci√≥n dice que no deber√≠an ser pr√°cticamente nulos o nulos. Lo que no me gust√≥ es que tratan de ocultarlo poni√©ndole una mica protectora para que parezca que no tiene rayones, y es algo enga√±oso.No es mal producto pero en mi opini√≥n les recomiendo que si lo compran, le quiten esa mica para ver las condiciones reales en las que lo env√≠an."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Me encant√≥ de principio a fin!!! No puedo creer que aunque sea renovado tenga la bater√≠a al 100% y con ning√∫n detalle est√©tico, incluso viene con una mica y nunca se ha abierto porque todav√≠a tiene el sello contra el agua (verificado con el barometro) y todas sus piezas obviamente son originales (verificado con un programa, la bater√≠a solo tenka 30 ciclos) por much√≠simo menos dinero de lo que cuesta, es de verdad incre√≠ble"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","POR LA RELACION PRECIO CALIDAD LE DOY UN 10, LLEVO MAS DE 4 MESES USANDOLO Y FUNCIONA A LA PERFECCION Y SIN DETALLES.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Por lo menos a m√≠, mi dispositivo lleg√≥ con un rall√≥n profundo y porcentaje de bateria en 88%.

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo uso para todo, lo mejor es que pude acomodar una l√≠nea de att en forma de chip virtual, y otra de telcel en el chip f√≠sico, y ya no requiero dos aparatos. Realmente estoy muy contento con el equipo, excelentes fotos y videos tambi√©n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Est√©tica al 100, buena calidad precio. Sin quejas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno, pero ven√≠a algo raspado"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al ser un producto re manufacturado estaba consiente de que tendr√≠a algunos desgastes o defectos.

Desgraciadamente al destaparlo me lleve la desagradable sorpresa de que estaba bastante rayada de la pantalla y tra√≠a varios golpes en las orillas del marco met√°lico as√≠ como en las c√°maras.

Los rayones estaban demasiado profundos.

Desgraciadamente estuve fuera de mi domicilio por trabajo bastante tiempo.
Por lo que al regresar y revisar el
Producto perd√≠ el tiempo de devoluci√≥n.

Termine gastando m√°s en cambiar el Glass da√±ado del tel√©fono.

La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 87% y a la fecha se ha mantenido.

Personalmente no vuelvo a comprar renovado."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo perfecto unas ligeras marcas de uso en la zona de c√°maras pero est√©tica de 9.5 dir√≠a, me llego con 100% de vida de bater√≠a, tendr√© que devolverlo porque mi banco no me respeto la promoci√≥n de reembolso en estado de cuenta :( es una l√°stima pero si lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","F√≠sicamente lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones, sin un s√≥lo ray√≥n. Funcionamiento perfecto. Est√° c√≥mo nuevo."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con rayones es normal por que es renewed y pues es obvio que alguien m√°s lo uso, pero al mes justamente ayer ya no jalo el Face ID y le sali√≥ una raya verde a la pantalla y se apaga y se prende la pantalla cuando quiere lo bueno que alcance a tramitar el reembolso ya que Amazon te da 90 d√≠as de garant√≠a. Espero que los dem√°s si les haya salido muy bien su equipo solo es mi caso en particular."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Supero mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El √∫nico detalle que tiene en contra es una bater√≠a con 85% de vida, por lo dem√°s, gran tel√©fono"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° en muy buen estado, sin ning√∫n ray√≥n o golpe, est√° en una condici√≥n de 10 y la bater√≠a me llego con 99% , aunque no todo fue del todo bien ya que d√≠as antes hab√≠a pedido el color space gray y me perdieron el paquete, aunque eso ya fue cuesti√≥n de la paqueter√≠a pero en cuanto al tel√©fono ten√≠a mis dudas por comentarios que le√≠ y la verdad es que no me arrepiento, hasta ahora todo funcionando bien y a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo me lleg√≥ en estado impecable.
Se ve como nuevo, no tiene detalles est√©ticos.
Funciona perfectamente. Me lleg√≥ con 98% de vida √∫til de bater√≠a. Recomendado al 100."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente proveedor es el tercer equipo que pido con el mismo proveedor"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto excelente, lamentablemente fui asaltado, me gustar√≠a saber si pueden proporcionarme el n√∫mero de imei para bloquearlo por favor.
Gracias"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta muy bien!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Uno tiene sus reservas cuando hace este tipo de compras, sin embargo cada vez los proveedores van mejorando y √©se es el chiste que cada vez vayan dando m√°s confianza. Es la segunda vez que lo hago, la vez pasada con el Iphone 8, estuvo bien, pero esta vez, me fue mejor. Ojal√° uds tengan a√∫n, una mejor experiencia."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy triste pr que un a√±o despues de estar funcionando el equipo, la pantalla dejo de responder sin causa alguna."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery is less than 90%. The phone is overpriced. It‚Äôs available on Swappa for much less."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me tarde en escribir la rese√±a para poder ver si el iPhone presentaba alguna falla y hasta el d√≠a de hoy todo incre√≠ble, llego con buena bater√≠a (99%) sin ninguna imperfecci√≥n (rapaduras, manchas o golpes) desbloqueado para cualquier compa√±√≠a y sin problemas con iCloud. En pocas palabras perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Solo por la bater√≠a pero excelentes la verdad. Aun as√≠ me dura lo suficiente la carga"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con su caja y cargador gen√©ricos, pero el equipo f√≠sicamente al 100, bater√≠a al 100, tiempo de entrega d√≠a siguiente, msi."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El dispositivo lleg√≥ como nuevo con una bater√≠a al 89%, solo pueden apreciarse algunos peque√±os rasgu√±os en la pantalla cerca de la c√°mara, sin embargo, fuera de ese detalle parece un tel√©fono nuevo, el cargador es gen√©rico y la verdad no me dio mucha confianza, prefer√≠ utilizar el que ya ten√≠a."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone lleg√≥ bien, funciona bien, est√©tica 10/10 pero lleg√≥ con el 90% de bater√≠a :/"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Screen had some pretty big scratches that were covered by their screen protector wasn't impressed"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy muy contento con la compra, el celular llego en excelentes condiciones, ya han pasado los d√≠as desde que lo compre y estoy 100% satisfecho. Debo decir que cuando me lleg√≥ , no estaba muy contento porque no ven√≠a en su caja original ni sus accesorios, ya que el abrir un iphone en su empaque tambi√©n es una experiencia genial. Fuera de eso sin problemas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad estuve dudosa en si me conven√≠a c√≥mpralo, pero qued√© gratamente sorprendido, no tiene ning√∫n detalle de est√©tica, el funcionamiento es perfecto, la bater√≠a viene al 100%Sin duda ha sido una compra muy buena.Adem√°s que cuentan con meses sin intereses y llego antes de lo que esperaba."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo dos semanas utiliz√°ndolo. Lleg√≥ en otro empaque pero eso es lo de menos, ya que hasta el momento ha funcionado de maravilla y hasta me lleg√≥ con la mica protectora de pantalla como extra, siendo que cuestan muy caras. Sin duda volver√≠a a comprar productos reacondicionados en Amazon. Totalmente una compra 100% ecol√≥gica. No me arrepiento de la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","It works great but I‚Äôd say for the price... add a AirPod. Also I‚Äôm traveling internationally from Canada to Jamaica and would love to know if it‚Äôs unlocked for Jamaica"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Espero s√≥lo haya sido mala suerte. El iPhone estaba impecable incluso tra√≠a una mica para la pantalla y con 94% de condici√≥n. Lo configure y use por una semana. Hab√≠a tenido un poco de problema con la se√±al de Telcel pero se solucion√≥ s√≥lo (quien sabe c√≥mo). El problema fue que una semana despu√©s la pantalla se puso verde, despu√©s se quit√≥ y sent√≠ alivio, pero volvi√≥ a ponerse en verde y as√≠ estuvo iba y ven√≠a el verde. Me hab√≠a gustado mucho pero tuve que devolverlo. Afortunadamente pude borrar mis datos. Estoy en espera del reembolso. He comprado otros y nunca me hab√≠a pasado esto de la pantalla verde."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto ven√≠a sin detalles est√©ticos, funcionando de manera √≥ptima, incluyendo el face id y con pila del 89%. Sin embargo al actualizar a iOS 15 detect√≥ que la pantalla no era la original. Siendo est√° una pantalla que incluso no era OLED."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bien el Tel√©fono, su pila con 89% pero bien y cuidado para ser renovado sin problemas de funcionamiento u otras cosas lo recomiendo, el precio bien a meses y cobla confianza de que Amazon te responde"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Considero que si estuvo algo elevado el precio ."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad era lo que esperaba, excedi√≥ mi expectativa ya que llego 2 dias antes de lo programado, me llamo la atenci√≥n que el celular ya venia hasta con protector de vidrio templado, claro que volver√≠a a comprar, sabiendo que son productos buenos y sobretodo garantizados , si te ahorras unos cuantos miles de pesos en Mexico respecto a su valor NUEVO."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone SE calienta mucho al usarlo y llega con una mica de vidrio, se la quite para ponerle una mica mate y cual fue mi sorpresa ‚ÄúLA PANTALLA RAYADA Y TALLADA‚Äù tiene muchos rayones y talones, le ponen la mica para disimular su estado. Estoy por devolverlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone didn't work right was told to return it and I did want a refund"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ con lo que indica, au qu√© la pantalla est√° muy rallada, cosa que se intent√≥ tapar con un protector de vidrio."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho , llego en muy buenas condiciones, la bater√≠a en un 90% y con cristal protector.
No incluye cargador ni caja original, pero por el costo y la promoci√≥n de MSI lo vale!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ten√≠a mis dudas puesto que siempre he comprado las cosas directamente en apple, la verdad muy bien el funcionamiento y la est√©tica de 100, llevo un mes con √©l y todo en orden, me llego con 94% en vida de bater√≠a! Buena compra a mi parecer"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Amazing quality for a refurbished cellphone! No scratch at all, battery health at 93% is a bit low, but the overall quality is pretty great for the price! Would definitely buy again from Amazon Refurbished Products!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gust√≥ mucho, ven√≠a en excelentes condiciones y con una bater√≠a del 94%, con una mica y sin rayones de nada."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","De lujo, lo recomiendo mucho!"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Completely worth the price!!.. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I‚Äôm üíØ happy with the phone.. Battery life at 95% and not a scratch on the unit.."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Una verdadera lastima a la hora de abrir el paquete, siempre est√°s con la ilusi√≥n de estrenar un equipo ya sea nuevo o usado pero la ilusi√≥n se volvi√≥ frustraci√≥n al ver que solo ven√≠an instrucciones del equipo reacondicionado y un cargador generico, creo que es una falta grave de respeto hacer ese tipo de cosas y no los justifico de ning√∫n modo, lo √∫nico bueno de todo esto fue que si me hicieron el reembolso, 20 d√≠as despu√©s de la compra y yo sin celular y sin dinero por esos largos 20 d√≠as de angustia, espero y les sirva este comentario y a ustedes no les pase lo mismo"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente relaci√≥n calidad precio"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto que el equipo a√∫n tra√≠a Apple care, que tra√≠a mica y no ten√≠a ning√∫n golpe visible, no me agrado que no viniera al 100 la pila y que no tuviera sus cargador y cable originales ya que el precio que dan el equipo es alto poco m√°s y te compras el 12 Max pro"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular me llego con las c√°maras rayadas, pantalla rayada y lo peor con las bocinas tapadas con mugre, tanta mugre que no se escucha nada cuando hablo por tel√©fono. Esperaba m√°s de los est√°ndares de calidad de Amazon."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular funciona a la perfecci√≥n y no tiene ning√∫n detalle. Al menos no lo he encontrado. Como mencionan el estado de la bater√≠a obviamente no es el 100% pero por temas de funcionalidad todo esta excelente."

El iPhone tiene est√©tica de 10, llego con buen porcentaje de bater√≠a. Parece nuevo literal. Recomiendo al vendedor y el producto. Lo √∫nico que no me gusto fueron los cargadores ya que en el anuncio sal√≠a con los cargadores originales."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es barato pero te arriesgas mucho, me toc√≥ mala suerte. La pantalla al inclinar el celular se nota colores no originales y no es de la misma calidad de imagen"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","No se nota que fuera un renewal , todo funciona al 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba nervoso porque se me hac√≠a un precio muy barato, adem√°s de leer rese√±as de que pod√≠an venir sin servir o rayados, pero a√∫n as√≠ decid√≠ tomar el riesgo. No pude haber tomado mejor decisi√≥n, est√° impecable. Ni un solo ray√≥n y su bater√≠a al 100%."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene como se indica, el iPhone en excelentes condiciones, con las especificaciones establecidas, la vida de la bater√≠a al 100. El cable y cargador es gen√©rico como se establece. Lo malo es que el cargador es de muy bajo amperaje y tarda una eternidad en cargar, creo al poner cargador gen√©rico podr√≠an incluir uno de carga r√°pida."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El tel√©fono ven√≠a en muy buenas condiciones, solo rayones min√∫sculos en la pantalla, el resto del tel√©fono estaba como nuevo. Ninguna pieza interna ha sido cambiada y su bater√≠a estaba al 95 %. Lo √∫nico malo es el cargador que incluye, es gen√©rico, no recomiendo que se use, ya que podr√≠a da√±ar la bater√≠a. Y ya tengo dos meses con √©l y funciona a la perfecci√≥n !"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular est√° impecable, no tiene ning√∫n da√±o f√≠sico visible, lleg√≥ s√∫per r√°pido y hasta ahorita no ha tenido ninguna falla de ning√∫n tipo. La pila est√° al 92%Creo que vale mucho la pena estoy muy contenta con mi compra."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","el telefono llego en perfecto estado , impecable lo malo de comprar ese tipo de telefono es que no vienen equipados con la frecuencia de datos moviles de 28 , que es la necesaria para soportar compa√±ias de telefono como es bait , pillofon , la de megacable , etc , te limitas solo a telcel , att , unefon y esas de ese estilo , si ati no te interesan esas telefonias mas economicas , es una muy buena opcion"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad tuve terror de comprar un celular re acondicionado pero ya llevo dos semanas us√°ndolo y no he tenido el menor problema. El tel√©fono no ten√≠a ning√∫n detalle est√©tico ni funcional. Bater√≠a al 99% y no trae cables originales ni aud√≠fonos pero honestamente si por eso va a costar la mitad, no tengo ning√∫n problema. ¬°Excelente compra! Lo volver√≠a a hacer."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno la verdad solo peque√±os detalles pero es normal"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego de Estetica de 10 , pero la pantalla si estaba muy rallada le puse una mica de cristal y problema solucionado pero al mes me empez√≥ a fallar el Face ID y lo tuve que devolver , lo raro que al otro d√≠a ya lo estaban vendiendo otra vez porque lo ten√≠an como producto agotado , no se si sea coincidencia o les vali√≥ que fallaba y lo pusieron otra vez ala venta"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","La bter√≠a lleg√≥ al 85%, despu√©s de 2 semanas baj√≥ a 84%. Ten√≠a dos marcas circulares en pantalla que se notaban a contra luz. Los orificios se ven sucios. Se calentaba mucho y se medio empa√±aba la mica de cristal. El rendimiento y funci√≥n fu√© correcto Pero no me agrad√≥ el calentamiento ni tantos detalles f√≠sicos. Afortunadamente esta la opci√≥n de devolver. Realmente esperaba mas."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto est√° como nuevo, funciona al 100%. Viene en un empaque gen√©rico con un cargador gen√©rico y un cable de carga gen√©rico, pero el tel√©fono es 100% original y viene muy bien protegido."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta bien el tel√©fono sin problemas, lo √∫nico malo son los accesorios"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo compr√© y el d√≠a que lo revise no serv√≠a bien la c√°mara y la bocina. Venia con varios rasgu√±os demasiado evidentes.Lleg√≥ en una caja como de huevo Jajaja deber√≠an tener una mejor presentaci√≥n para que no se da√±e m√°s el celular.Lo √∫nico bueno fue que Amazon me reembols√≥ el pago sin problema."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene s√∫per cuidado, ning√∫n detalle y me lleg√≥ con 96% de bater√≠a, lo malo es que viene con un cable gen√©rico y sin cubo."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","En lo personal no me agrado que en todo el marco tenga detalles, especialmente por que menciona que no se ver√°n a una mano de distancia, pero se ve. De m√°s. No se distingue tanto en foto pero en persona si. Creo que no pedir√≠a otro."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio dudaba de si comprar o no un tel√©fono reacondicionado pero finalmente me anim√© y la vdd es que no me arrepiento, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ en perfecto estado y a tiempo, solo tiene uno o dos peque√±os rasgu√±os en la pantalla pero en el d√≠a a d√≠a ni se notan, todo funciona perfecto, llevo unos d√≠as con el dispositivo y todo va excelente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me parecio una excelente compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El telefono funciona sin problemas.Lo malo es que la pantalla venia con muchos rayones. De hecho tenia un protector encima como para que uno no se diera cuenta.Tambien tiene como plumon negro indeleble en el marco del telefono."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","If I could give 0 stars I would. The ad said that it was a brand new phone but it wasn‚Äôt. For a new phone, I had to remove plenty of dust from the charging port, the microphone and the speakers. Also, the phone did not come with original authentic case and chargers. Currently looking into returning the phone. Not pleased at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto , me lleg√≥ con bater√≠a del %98La √∫nica queja ser√≠a con el cable y el cargador que tardaban mucho en cargar .Tra√≠a mica y ni un solo detalle de golpes o desgaste.Lo recomiendo altamente"

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular llego golpeado, decid√≠ qued√°rmelo porque es un fuerte gasto y no tengo manera para comprobar que el celular hab√≠a llegado golpeado y no hab√≠a sido yo. Me di cuenta hasta que lo saque del empaque. Compre un celular similar en Walmart y todo fue excelente, decid√≠ darle la oportunidad al vendedor en Amazon, pero fallaron totalmente."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esperaba un poco m√°s de est√©tica en el equipo, llega rayado y con golpes es entendible por el precio pero para ser honestos si ya le van a invertir en este equipo p√≥nganle un poco m√°s y compren uno nuevo, yo lo hubiera hecho."

"iPhone 11 Pro Max","amazing product these guys sell, would not know the difference between new or renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se ve√≠a perfecto hasta que intent√© encenderlo. Not√© que el bot√≥n de encendido estaba medio sumido y tuve que presionarlo m√°s de lo normal para que respondiera. Este es una falla muy obvia. La verdad me decepcion√≥ que esta falla no haya sido detectada por Amazon como lo indican en la descripci√≥n de sus productos Reacondicionados donde aseguran que revisan antes los productos. Es una pena ya que el resto del equipo estaba en muy buen estado. Lo devolver√© inmediatamente ya que as√≠ no puedo aceptarlo."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone gets too warm when switched on and seems to use up the battery over a period of about 12 hours with minimal use. I take it that after a few charge up operations, this should normalize. Other than that, it works very well with a clear display and reliable functionality. The Otter Box protects the phone magnificently. I am generally pleased with the phone and there is no sign that it was ever used even for a day. Thank you for your reliable product."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like the color, how it came with a glass screen protector, it was packaged very well and also came a day earlier than expected."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Iba a comprar el renewed premium por el tema del % de la bateria, sin embargo decid√≠ por el normal, y me vino en 88% la bateria. La camara funciona perfectamente bien y todas sus funciones, rayones minimos en la pantalla, nada que me afecte. Excelente producto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","When I ordered they said that the excellent condition was supposed to be at least 90% but it is 82% which is low having in mind that any phone with a battery life below 80% the battery is going away really fast and 82% percent is not really far from that/"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is great so far. Only had it a few weeks. Battery has good life and charges fast. The camera takes great pictures. This is a great phone for the cost. Would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My son is delighted with it. His previous iPhone was a 7 without any memory left. I have the 12 and they are very similar."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came in good condition very satisfied came with charger and all it‚Äôs not an apple charger tho but the phone hood battery well recommend getting"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It‚Äôs as good as brand new considering the fact that it‚Äôs renewed. Superb face recognition and a long battery life! So why buy brand new?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I recommend this in lieu of purchasing new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ordered and received an iPhone 11 Pro (excellent condition). Screen and back glass are virtually flawless and aluminium siding is in great condition. Front screen protector came already installed on phone (a nice bonus). Battery life is a bit lower than hoped for (83%) but still gets thru day even under heavy usage. Prime shipping went without hiccup and picked up at a local amazon locker. Highly recommend this seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received the phone in beautiful condition. Everything worked and I was pleased with the purchase until I inadvertently forgot it in the pocket of my swim trunks and I stepped into the hot tub. The phone was exposed to a water depth of about 18 inches for about 5 seconds when I realized it. I pulled it out of my pocket immediately. Every lens was fogged with water, and my true depth camera was immediately disabled. These phones are supposed to be IP68 rated and Apple says it can withstand submersion up to 4 meters for 30 minutes. My guess is that it was repaired and the seal was not done correctly. Very disappointing. I was fortunate that the condensation on the camera lenses eventually cleared, but face-id is still disabled."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got this to replace my old iPhone 6 as the battery was no longer charging. The phone was in really good condition when I received it. Battery lasts all day long to text talk play games/movies and use GPS. Picture quality is good. I am not tech savvy and was worried about learning how to use the new phone but have been pleasantly surprised. Easily paired with air pods and now I am always listening to music on my long walks. Love the iPhone 11! Am happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Look brand new! Was looking for a ProMax,though. Nice phone overall."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So my iPhone 11 Pro came a day early. I opened the Box it came in, mind you it‚Äôs do not expect an Apple packaged box. The box came with the iPhone and a charge head and cod( not apple branded ). The phone had a screen protector for the screen and the camera. No scratches came with the phone. The phone felt and looked like a brand new one. I would have given it 5 stars but it came with a non apple charger head and cod. In conclusion you should buy this."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excellent!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Esta en muy buen estado no tiene ninguna imperfecci√≥n me encanto ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone works just fine with no problems. I've had it for over a year now and the phone has been fine, as expected."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Snergy delivered the Iphone 11 in perfect condition. I'm using the Iphone Internationally without any problems."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","On a fixed income and needed to upgrade my phone. Found one in my budget and had mostly positive reviews. Will be awhile before I get a feel for it‚Äôs performance. Delivery time sucked but that‚Äôs on UPS."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My dad, who does frequent international travel, has mulitple foreign country SIM cards. He used to have multiple ""burner"" phones for each country he traveled, but that got expensive and also cumbersome. He wanted an unlocked, full featured iPhone, but didn't want to pay the price of a brand new i13.This i11 Max has good screen size, good resolution, good cameras and a good processor. It's not blazing fast or has the highest megapixels like the current gen, but it's good enough... and it has 256 GB of memory.When foreign country SIM cards were inserted, the phone recognized it and we were able to do test texting (foreign country voice rates are really high!) with no problem.The phone had very few scratches and the screen was scratch free. If you didn't look closely, you'd think it was new.I recommend the extended warranty if you are local (US based), but if you are international, you will probably have cheaper repair costs over seas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Unfortunately I need to keep buying smartphones because they are an essential part of life, but the spying capabilities of these phones are a violation of personal privacy.CAMERAThe camera is the best it's ever been. The photos are incredible. The processing does something to your skin to make it look smooth. The portrait option makes the figure pop out in the frame.SCRATCHINGThis iPhone scratches when just in a pocket and touching normal clothing. I've never used a screen protector and had an iPhone scratch so easily. On reading more, I see this is a common problem with the iPhone 11 and is because they made the glass stronger, which made it scratch easily. Apple should provide a warning on purchase and a free screen protector, but they do not.BATTERYMuch faster than my previous iphone 7. I have leftover charge each day after one full charge overnight.FACIAL RECOGNITION EASE OF USEThis is a downgrade from the iphone 7. The fingerprint sensor was fast. The facial recognition has not added anything to the phone - it's made the phone slower and more cumbersome. ApplePay is not fun to use anymore. The side button is a hassle to double click through a case for Apple Pay.For some reason, Force Touch was removed from the phone. This removes a lot of functions or makes them much slower. The iphone 7 was probably the best iphone Apple made in terms of responsiveness and efficiency.THE APP STOREStill can't read all reviews on the app store for an app. How am I supposed to know what people think of the app?SPYINGDid you know that:-It is impossible to turn off WiFi or Bluetooth so that you can always be tracked-Anyone can purchase your tracker information from private companies and know anything about you-When you give an app permission to access your photos, the people running the app can access every single one of your photos-When you give an app access to your microphone, it can listen to you any time-When you give an app access to your email, it can literally download and read all of your emails-When you give an app access to your location at any time, it probably knows where you live and work-Apps place lots of trackers on your phone. When you charge your phone at night, then is when it's sending out that data. This is the ""background app refresh"" setting on your app. Turn it off to stop the trackers. (to read more, check out the Washington Post article ""It‚Äôs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?"")-It seems that Apple plans to improve this with iOS14, but from the description of the features it will have, it will barely begin to cover all the problemsApple should be more transparent and clear to customers on the tracking abilities of the phone. They should make private companies agree that they will not sell your data to law enforcement of the government."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","All i can say is..GET THIS!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Neat and nice"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No se escucha bien el audio calificaci√≥n mala"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came in great condition only problem was the battery life at 83% but still a great product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came in perfect condition. I‚Äôm not sure if the battery life should have been at 100 considering it‚Äôs a refurbish phone, but it was at 84% once it arrived. Meaning it‚Äôs going to lose battery fast and take time to charge. I‚Äôd keep this in mind if you‚Äôre thinking of buying!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in slower than originally noted to ship, but not too bad. iPhone 11Pro is in good cosmetic shape with one noticeable scratch to the screen prior to applying my tempered glass screen protector. After charging it up fully, found that it lists the battery life at 89%, not the minimum 90% they promise, but not low enough to want to warranty or request a replacement, but enough to knock off a star. Have used the phone for a few weeks and battery life remains at 89%, so it appears to be pretty good and it lasts longer on a charge than the 5+ year old iPhone 7 I replaced. So far I am over all happy with the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I needed to upgrade my phone, but new iPhones are due out soon and I didn't want to buy a NIB phone until that happens. The iPhone 11 Pro is a couple of years old, but it will meet my needs until I am ready to purchase the latest generation. I had recently bought this same model, used, on a popular reseller market site. The experience was terrible. The phone condition wasn't as good as it was advertised to be, not even close. The battery health was poor as well, again, a misrepresentation. I returned that phone immediately (more hassle) and bought one I am using now through Amazon. The experience was as different as night and day. This phone is in excellent condition, and the battery health meets the guaranteed minimum (over 80% capacity).I was confident in my purchase because I know that Amazon makes returns easy. Didn't need to go there because the phone is great!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The face recognition is great along with the new emoji/ bitmoji face tracking, has three camera in the back for different zoom and detail, it's also waterproof, the sides are rounded and are shiny, and the back of it has a new type of hard cover. It's not too small, nor too big for your hands. The performance is also great for this wonderful looking product."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hubiera preferido una vida √∫til de bater√≠a mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I haven‚Äôt had any problems with my phone and I have created so many memories with this device. ü§ó"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","iPhone is locked by a different carrier than what I listed in the product description. Specifically purchased from this listing for model and carrier."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased a 11 pro reconditioned, visually the phone is absolutely perfect, even if it‚Äôs sent in a general box and inside a zip lock bag. They provide a paper clip with instructions to use it as SIM card compartment tool, and up to here is not amazing but acceptable.Phone comes with charger, so a plus for iPhone new standard, only problem, when the ring volume is at max, you can hear a vibration noise from the speaker, we have no time nor options to send it back for such a small defect, so probably will keep it as is unless it gets worse"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was in good condition and came with a screen protectorHowever it was on 76% battery health when it was supposed to come with 80+I haven't found any other problems with the phone other than this issue"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had no problems with my phone at all. Battery life was at 100%, absolutely no cracks or scratches anywhere."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My battery is full charge but when it off the charger it shuts off. So Apple sent me a message advising me, the battery is NOT AN APPLE PART."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Worth buying a refurb"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Likes: Clean, no scratches on screen or case. 90-day warranty against technical device failures, 30-day return policy. Face recognition works fine and all buttons are snappy and responsive just like new.Dislikes: SIM card drawer had some dirt around it which I cleaned easily. Battery has 83% life and display screen is not Apple certified which shows up as a warning on the Settings->About info page.Time will tell if upgrading/replacing an iPhone11 with 64GB and 87% battery life to this device with better telephoto lens and 8x storage was a good choice. Just know that ‚Äúcertified‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean all parts inside are Apple certified. Consider that when making your purchase. Four stars on tech support for non-Apple display screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Aun no puedo calificarlo, porque el vendedor se ofrecio a subsanar el inconveniente dando un credito, pero aun no me ha reconocido nada"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have Boost Mobile and wasn‚Äôt sure if this would work. But yes it‚Äôs unlocked so Boost was able to activate it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery only 80% life"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","todo perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Glad I picked it over the S22. Bought it from TCR and it came in mint condition, 81% battery health. Would recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The only downside is that they tried to hide a scratch from the screen by placing a screen protector, no a big deal since the phone is refurbished, the battery health was at 83% so it seems to last around 5-6 hours of constant use (depends on use) other than that the phone is great an amazing deal for an iPhone with little to no issues at all if you can deal with the battery not lasting as long as a new phone and the small imperfections go for it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came in a plain white box with a generic charging cable, charger and a sim extraction tool. The phone looks like new, I could not find any scratches or scuff marks and the screen looks like it's never been touched. The phone I received has 83% Battery health exceeding the 80% minimum guaranteed. I you want better battery health order an Premium Amazon Renewed phone. I inserted my Mint mobile sim and it immediately recognized it and started working, didn't even have to contact the carrier. I am very happy with my purchase, the phone looks like new and the battery life is more than I need in a day. Next phone upgrade I'm buying another Renewed phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Second try from seller BUYSPRY, returned first one for scratches. This silver iPhone 11 Pro 256GB came with a glass screen protector that‚Äôs slightly off center and has a weird glue around it and in the earpiece that I‚Äôm trying to scrape off. Deep scratch over one of the front sensors shown in photo. Light scratches on rear camera bump rings. Good news is all sensors and speakers are in working order, even the scratched one. I don‚Äôt dare take off the screen protector as I believe it‚Äôs covering a lot of scratches, but I don‚Äôt see any scratches as is, so I give it a pass. Battery is at 100% life so I‚Äôm very happy there. Overall for $499 I‚Äôm happy with the purchase and will stick with it, and just hope that whatever is under the screen protector isn‚Äôt too bad."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works as intended"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The display was a non-genuine part, and battery health was only 86% even though I paid for Renewed Premium. I returned this item."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is in decent condition. Screen has no damage, but there are scratches on the camera lenses and body. Battery heath is actually better than promised- 100%- however I got notifications that the screen isn‚Äôt a genuine part, so I can‚Äôt trust the waterproofing or longevity. Will update if I notice anything else."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Midnight Green and it looks fantastic, today almost 2 months into use, I have no regrets.Short version:If you want great performance, great cameras, and great battery life, go for it.Not so short version:2 months after my purchase, I am quite happy. I have been using Android since 2013 and today there are almost no options that can compete in the 3 main pillars that interest me: performance, camera and battery.The box it came in was generic (as mentioned on Amazon Renewed), it comes with a also generic charger that charges up to 100% in about 1 hour 30 minutes (I thought it would be worse). It did not have a single aesthetic detail, everything perfect and with a 95% battery health.The options I had were: the iPhone 11 (any version), Google Pixel 5 and OnePlus 8T. What convinced me most of all on the iPhone was the stabilization of the videos, it is something fantastic. Almost all the apps you used on Android are also available on the AppStore and the way iOS works is simply amazing.I was afraid of getting bored, but that was not the case.The only point ""against"" I find is that today the battery health decreased from 95% to 89% (in 2 months), I don't know why, but it still has a good life.I love the photos and the way it handles the HDR, you just open the camera app and shoot, in videos, the best stabilization on a smartphone.If you are looking for performance, cameras and battery, this is the best option. I saw that there are not too many important differences with the 12 or 12 Pro, more than the LiDar sensor and the 5G that for me are not essential.I am very comfortable on iOS and the way everything works. I think I'll stay a long time. I hope it helps you.--- UPDATE July 18, 2022After 1 year and 6 months, the Face ID suddenly stopped working and with that a battery failure, it discharges much faster, I have ios 15.5 and although it shows a health of 88%, after the Face ID failure, it ends 3-4x faster. Sounds like planned obsolescence.I am a disappointed in this aspect."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was givin the option to return or refund, but I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle because the issue is more than likely dirt in the speaker holes. Other than that it‚Äôs a great phone!"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I got my wife this phone not only to finally get it into her head that apple makes a better phone then android but because she has been wanting an iPhone for as long as I have known her, Was hoping the battery life would have been better but with a renewed device you get what you get, I ended up paying the 70 dollars to put a new battery in the phone for her so now it is like a brand new phone. She is vary happy with it and now we aren't fighting over who uses android auto or apple car play lol."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery was 84%. Phone looked nee and is working perfectly."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got what I paid for nothing more nothing less"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My wife was thrilled with this as a replacement for her iPhone 6s. Unfortunately after updating to iOS 15.6, we got a cellular error. After updating iOS AGAIN via PC and iTunes, we still had a cellular error. Apple support assisted us. We were advised that we had an issue with the iPhone itself and not the carrier. So we were forced to return it and pay more for a replacement. Of course, it was IMPOSSIBLE to make or receive calls or text messages, or cellular data. So it was useless as a cellular phone. I had no other choice. Returned it on Friday July 29 at the Amazon locker at 4925 S Broadway."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Considering my last phone I bought 4 years ago on Amazon from a really shady seller had a badly damaged camera and horrible screen burn in. This phone was immaculate and in really good shape. My only complaint would be the battery health being at 80%. This phone was definitely used yet despite that. I‚Äôm getting surprisingly good batter life. I would definitely recommend. However. Make sure you go with a seller who has high positivity rating. The sellers of this iPhone I got in particular had that and I got a great quality device overall. And I hope I have the pleasure of being another device from them in the future."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The condition of the phone is clean, no scratchesThe only issue I have is the error I see in my settings display showing that the parts replaced are not genuine apple partsIf you all can live with this than this is a good dealOn a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 5 just because of the error I have on my phone regarding the parts replacedI guess you get what you pay for"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So I was really nervous when buying this because I saw a couple people say the screen was pushed out. I am here to let you know those people are not very smart, it is not the screen that is pushed out but instead a very thick and reliable screen protector that they apply for you! It's applied almost perfectly so I also thought my screen was pushed out, but after checking it's just a screen protector!The battery life was at 89% which isn't a big deal to me as I switched from an iphone 7, pre battery upgrade, so it lasts MUCH longer. I can go about 16 hours of casually using my phone before I get >10%. If you want a new phone without the hassle I highly suggest getting this or others they have available. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I must admit I was very hesitant to purchase a used/renewed iPhone off Amazon but the cost savings, ease of purchase and Amazons history of standing behind their products convinced me to purchase it.Pro‚Äôs:1 - cost savings2 - Amazons commitment (in writing) to stand by the product for a year (no questions asked) as well as battery capacity of 90% or better3 - ease of purchase and on time delivery4 - packaging was very ‚ÄúApple-like‚Äù in its look and feel5 - although I‚Äôve only had the phone for 2 months, it has performed without flawCon‚Äôs: NONEI highly recommend purchasing your next iPhone from Amazon‚Ä¶you will not regret it! üëçüëç"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","This iphone is like new and even better as it came with an installed
protective screen cover. thanks!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very nice that i can make payments on the phone. Even tho no phone is worth so much. apple knows we cant leave without a phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love this phone. It‚Äôs fast, dependable, reliable, and just works great. I take advantage of the dual sim feature and so far have been loving the seamlessness of it. Amazing battery too, way better than previous iPhones. Faster data. I can tell it is faster than the iPhone XS (previous model), and the cameras are better as well. I can assess that I don‚Äôt regret the upgrade.

HOWEVER....

I cannot say that I am 100% happy. For some reason, Apple removed 3D Touch from the iPhone 11 line, a feature that made the user experience even more personal and seamless. Haptic Touch is the replacement and it sucks. A HUGE step back..I feel like the phone is literally slower because the content doesn‚Äôt pop up upon applying pressure to the screen, but now you have to hold your finger on the content and wait longer. Apple thought nobody cared about 3D Touch and they were massively wrong. Everyone I know who upgraded is also disappointed. Such an easy, painless integration that made things so much easier. why the hell take it away?

Also, the iPhone 11 Pro is heavier than it‚Äôs predecessor, and it‚Äôs very noticeable. A lot more noticeable. It also feels thicker too.

The conclusion here is if you‚Äôre not a heavy power user you don‚Äôt HAVE to upgrade. If you do make the decision to however you would still be happy because it is a nice device overall despite missing 3D Touch and being heavier."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This review is specifically for the Amazon renewed Apple iPhone 11 Pro. It came with a screen cover that I did not realize was on it. So I put another screen protector on it. The volume for incoming calls was horrible in the ear but okay on speaker phone or over Bluetooth. Since I couldn‚Äôt tell that the first screen protector was not part of the actual phone, I took it to GeekSquad at Best Buy who recognized the problem immediately. Upon removing that screen protector that had been installed with the refurb process, the volume was immediately good as you would expect it to be. They cleaned a bit of adhesive out of the ear speaker and placed my other screen protector back on which did not cover the ear sound area and now all is better. GeekSquad was great and free, but I shouldn‚Äôt have had the problem on a NewToMe phone in the first place."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone works fine. The screen had some fairly significant scratches in that the seller attempted to obscure with a poorly applied screen protector. Battery capacity is at 85% but holds a decent charge.

While significantly less expensive than buying a brand new phone, this was still a pretty pricey purchase and I‚Äôm not 100% sure it‚Äôs the better value when you weigh the pros and cons, taking into consideration the condition of a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù product."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I needed to replace my old iPhone 6S as the battery life could not keep up with the latest apps and 16GB was not enough for my music as well as eBooks that I enjoy reading.
The tough decision was which phone do I want? Android or another Apple phone. I liked all the features an Android phone provides, but wanted a phone that would last a long long time. I finally decided the Apple iPhone 11 Pro was the best-case phone that had plenty of storage and an eco-systems I was familiar with.
The Pluses: It is an iPhone with a great screen, plenty of storage (256GB) and all the functions and features I am familiar with. It is a great phone when compared to all the other phones available at a reasonable price ($900 for a phone in my mind is insane, but having support and a quality phone, the price is expected.)
The Minuses: For a phone that does not make coffee, or make my bed, the price is steep. It is hard to justify why a phone should cost so much. Then add to that the yellowish screen when you first turn it on is terrible. (Yes, I found other users with the same experience and yes I did all the recommendations to make the screen look more like my iPhone 6S.) Then there is the damned eco system you are stuck with - want to make your buttons smaller, nope; have the background change often and automatically, nope; add you own pictures to the phone, nope; have similar apps to Android, nope.
Summary: I would recommend an Apple iPhone to anyone who likes Apple and the eco system. It is a beautiful phone. But if you are looking to buy a phone with a lot of features (apps) and want to tailor the phone like that of an Android phone, buy an Android and stay away, far away for the Apple and the stupid locked eco system."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was trying to avoid spending a lot on a phone to replace my previous phone which I broke (first phone I've EVER broken) so thought I'd try a refurbished phone that was supposedly in 'excellent condition' but it arrived, I put the SIM card in and made a call and realised I couldn't hear the other person clearly. I bought it mostly to record video for auditions (I'm an actor) & when I recorded a video the sound playback was awful! Firstly even at full volume I could barely hear it, but what I could hear was muffled/crackly/unclear. It sounded distorted like when you record something and it's peaking at too high a decibel range. There was no way I could keep it with that bad sound quality."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Being the first phone I bought off of Amazon, I was a little hesitant in buying this product, especially when reading some of the reviews. However, I bought it because my old iPhone was glitching terribly and I needed a replacement asap. The product came two days earlier than expected & is working smoothly as of right now. The battery was at around 40% when it arrived so I assumed it wasn‚Äôt fully charged when shipped. It was also fully unlocked, had no scratches anywhere on the screen/phone, and speakers are clean. The box it came with had a charger and small paper manual to set up the new phone. I am very satisfied with everything."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iphone vino en excelentes condiciones, sin raspaduras, sin rayones, con protector de pantalla. Funcionando todo 100% y bateria al 80% . El envio fue bastante rapido.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","After reading the negative reviews after ordering I was super scared that I had just made a big mistake. But I couldn‚Äôt be HAPPIER with the phone I received!!!! Perfect condition. Looks brand new. Battery life at 92% and works like it‚Äôs never been used before! It was expected to arrive 6 days after ordering but literally arrived the NEXT day! So happy I took the chance because I love my new birthday present to myself ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am annoyed that I paid extra for a renewed premium phone to receive 90-100% battery capacity and it only has 84%. I was afraid this would happen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Iphone looks new and preform like new, I give 4 stars because it came with 89 percent battery health instead of the 90 or over as advertised."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phones came fast. a day early. Excellent condition. My husband and I are very happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Sabemos que cuesta mucho creer cuando hay tanta y tantas opiniones diversas. Pero a las pruebas me remito. Mi iPhone 11 Pro lleg√≥ con 97% de condici√≥n de Bater√≠a. En √≥ptimas condiciones, sin rayas en la pantalla ni en los laterales brillantes. Todo funciona perfectamente ¬°Ah y hasta con protector de pantalla lleg√≥! La caja blanca gen√©rica en la que vino era un poco endeble, pero el tel√©fono estaba bien protegido por dentro. Cargador y cable gen√©rico, pero hay que entender que es un equipo refurbished. Lo estoy utilizando en Venezuela con Movistar y va de maravilla.Si est√°s pensando comprar este equipo, es una excelente decisi√≥n. Ten presente que si lo cuidas bien podr√°s utilizarlo por uno 3 o 4 a√±os m√°s."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the renewed premium which should include at least 90% battery health. Unfortunately it came with 88%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My phone was stolen and i had to replace it asap. This one came fast and perfect condition ! Very happy with it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came wrapped securely and was easy to set up. Very well taken care of and quality advertised was quality given. Would order from them again if I were to upgrade."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was hesitant purchasing from this company, at least at first. Compared to others they seem to be relatively new to Amazon, and that can end up poorly for the consumer if your not careful. However, after looking into their reviews of almost 100% customer satisfaction and excellent service I took a gamble at it.Honestly I don‚Äôt think Iv found a more honest, reliable, and well mannered company on all of Amazon. My first phone I had issues with, user error in purchasing and instantly got a return. My second phone got damaged and I asked for a replacement. They were kind enough to give me options on what best suits my needs, all while paying for 2 day shipping, both to send out the new phone and to return the other. Not only did I receive a brand new phone, perfectly in condition, 100% battery life and not a scratch on it, they also gave me my refund the second the phone was in their hands 2 days later.I cannot express enough to underrated this company truly is and how kind and helpful they have been to me over these past few weeks. Phones are not cheap, and they made the process smooth and reliable. Would easily purchase and recommend them again. They deserve it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The speakers on the phone sounded terrible, like I had put the phone up to one of those plastic toy microphones. Upon closer inspection, the speaker holes were filled with brown stuff. I didn't use it for very long, as I noticed the speakers were not working pretty quickly, but it seemed like the touch screen wasn't working properly either. Sometimes the phone wasn't sensitive if I touched the top third of the screen. The battery came at 84%. Apart from some slight scratching at the bottom of the screen, the phone looked good. The other reviews seemed good, so maybe I just had back luck."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I may be returning it I‚Äôm trying to give it a chance I don‚Äôt like the fact that the volume isn‚Äôt high enough I think there‚Äôs something wrong with it and the phone froze on me I had to turn it off to get it to work again so we‚Äôll see"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Did not provide Ear phones & charging cable.The charger adapter is NOT a genuine product (NOT from apple).Phone is under observation. getting an impression that its"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone shipped quickly and arrived next day at a fedex warehouse within 25 miles. It then sat there for several business days before it actually was out for delivery. Screen is pretty scratched with one in particular being especially deep. Battery health was advertised as 90% or better but came at 84%. Phone works and is unlocked as advertised but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Imma be real, when i bought this i actually thought samsung logo was gonna pop up but it didn‚Äôt. No scratches on the phone so idk what these other reviews are sayingü§®. Came in nice and clean. Can‚Äôt show yall pictures cuz im USING IT. But yea, if y‚Äôall need a phone, go buy itü§ùüèæ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Former android user. Switched to iPhone for camera quality. Phone performance is what you would expect from iPhone. Excellent camera and battery. Smooth is. Purchased this item as refurbished so I didn‚Äôt expect it to be like new. However there were several deep scratches in the front glass, hidden by a screen protector. Minus one star for this as I feel that the seller should have disclosed the scratches. Seller also misrepresented the shipping time. The phone did not actually ship until after it was supposed to have been delivered (received seller email notification that phone had shipped, 2 days after it was supposed to have been received). Minus another star for delivery dishonesty. Would have been 5 stars if not for these service issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","For the price you pay, I would say this phone is pretty good. I have noticed some issues already with the device being slow and not always responding, but the issue seems to resolve itself in less than a minute. Other than that, the phone itself looks as if it is as new and functions like that besides the occasional freezing."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm well aware that it is a refurbished phone but this battery came to me at 73% life or something and it dies very fast"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","it feels like i have a brand new phone. When i got it, it was on 87% witch is pretty high for a refurbished phone. I dont see any marks on the phone or anything like that. If i had to complain about anything, it would be that the front camera isnt as nearly as good as the back as far as clarity goes but maybe thats how it usually is. over all, extremely happy with my purchase. no regrets."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","With the amount of money I spent I this phone I expected the battery life t be in the 90‚Äôs or 100% but I received the phone with 83% battery life. Which isn‚Äôt terrible but for what I spent I expected better. 83% is good for 2-3 years of use without major battery drainage."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Used, refurbished, with 80% battery size, with the screen burnt by long-time display on.It doesn't have severe problem. It could be a phone used for display in a cellphone store so that the screen has marks and shadows of icons and signal bars left on.If you don't care these flaws, it's still worth to buy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Well, I started out giving my phone three stars because of some glitches. The questions Amazon asks about this certified refurbished iPhone 11 Pro don‚Äôt really apply. But being an iPhone gal I mostly love it. So I decided to go up to four stars. I went down a little in size from a 7 Plus, and the smaller size is better for me. But no real learning curve which also suits me since I have the patience of a puppy. Just a few issues though, including there being periods a week or two long sometimes when I cannot select text for copying and pasting etc. And the touch screen not registering my touch to open a link or complete a command. Sometimes I am unable to attach photos to a text from the Messages app; I have to go through the Photos app and select a photo and then write any text from there. And for over a week now my caps lock is nonexistent; if I want to yell at somebody I have to capitalize each letter separately. And you wouldn‚Äôt believe how annoying it is when you‚Äôre in the middle of shouting at somebody, and somewhere while you‚Äôre typing each capital letter at a time your righteous anger begins to drain away from the offender and is redirected at your phone because - yes - you have the patience of a puppy. Ok I don‚Äôt really yell at folks with my texts. But this is what I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô. Whoops, now I have to change the number of stars back down to 3 from a four."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I got this phone in and it came with a screen protector, I thought oh that‚Äôs nice of them! But the screen protector had a bubble in it so I decided to go ahead and change it.When removing the screen protector It revealed a lot of scratches on the screen.Check your screen if it comes with a protector already installed!!! My screen is scratched so much under the protector!!! They aren‚Äôt being nice, they are being tricky."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery is at 95%, as expected. It would be best if price is low by $50"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","First time buying a refurbished phone. Was very nervous about the whole process but desperately needed another phone and wanted something affordable not wanting to use my carrier and having to renew with them another 2 years.The phone matched the description perfectly and I love the 90 day free from defect policy. I am extremely pleased with all aspects of my purchase, will do it again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Externally looks with areas unpolished, battery life 80% (supposed to be more than 90%), I have some issues with the charging port."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","N/a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not as descripbed, bettery life 85% with scratches and small dents on the right side. Ended up returning it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I did not expect this from the buyer but he is awesome. I loved the phone. He gave the phone with a screen guard and a charger and a cord light scratches on the metal strip that is around the phone but still it‚Äôs not that bad. And getting a 512GB iPhone 11 Pro for 600 is a good deal. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the phone and it‚Äôs performance. It comes unlocked and it‚Äôs all good to go. The camera is perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came damage I can‚Äôt hear from the receiver"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Way better than I expected! Great condition, battery is 87% but honestly its way better than my old phone so I'm super thankful."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estaba preocupada por los comentarios que dec√≠an sobre la bater√≠a. Pero aunque me ha llegado con 84% de condici√≥n, es excelente su performance. La c√°mara es espectacular y me incluyeron un proyector de pantalla que realmente agradezco. Todo bien!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is everything you'd expect from an IPhone. There's no mystery there. It works and performs great.However, the description for the phone clearly stated:- This product is in ""Excellent condition"". It shows no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 12 inches.The back of the phone is covered in blemishes that will not simply come off. Bleach stains? Water damage? Hard to tell. But it's clearly not a case of ""no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 12 inches""Still considering returning...."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Typical fears of being scammed, not getting what I ordered, or it being completely broken; I got my package and seen the box and my heart SUNK when I seen a generic smart phone box but when I opened the box there was a shinny, basically brand new iPhone! No scratches, no cracks, no scam! I absolutely love my phone and so happy I bought it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded.
 I always wanted an iPhone because it is a good way to track your health, with the health app I even made some changes in my life after getting it. Like reduced my smoking and drinking."
"iPhone 11 Pro "," I always wanted an iPhone because it is a good way to track your health, with the health app I even made some changes in my life after getting it. Like reduced my smoking and drinking."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My renewed iPhone 11 Pro was from Buyspry. While I kept my phone and am very happy with it I gave it 4 stars. I took 1 star off because the screen had some pretty decent sized scratches and I'm honestly surprised they did not try harder to fix that. They had a cheap glass screen protector on it when it arrived and I replaced it with my own. I could kind of see some what appeared to be light scratches but after taking the screen protector off they were pretty bad. If I were someone who did not use a screen protector I would have sent it back. But once I put on my new tempered glass screen protector it really does mask the scratches and I can't even see them.

The rest of the body of the phone was in excellent condition, no other scratches or dings. The screen looks great and my battery health is at 100%. I'm sure this will last me for a while. Really the gamble here is probably dependent on who the seller is. But considering how much cheaper it was I don't regret getting this from Amazon Renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôve had for a year now when I got it there was no visible wear and it is still just as fast as when I got it 10/10 would recommend"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I realize this was a refurbished phone, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting something that looked flawless. That being said, it came in WAY better shape than I thought it would!! It had so signs of wear but nothing crazy; the glass had a couple minor, very small scratches you can‚Äôt even see with the screen on. That being said, I also bought a life proof case and with built in screen protector, you‚Äôd think it was a brand spanking new phone. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quality phone at a reasonable price, backed by a seemingly reasonable warranty."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It‚Äôs what I ordered, it was ready for use.

I didn‚Äôt like that the phone came with a cracked screen protector and when I removed the screen it had lots of adhesive and it took a few hours to remove it all. Once removed I noticed a few scratches that are viewable while the screen is on."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am a new Apple user, so I went from an android to iPhone. Problems with getting What's APP from old Android to new iPhone, couldn't in the end. Problems getting my photos from old Android on to new iPhone. Love the colour, love the look, just takes time getting use to it and no idea yet what all the features are all about. Amazon gave great service with regard to delivery."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Looks new from outside but battery life only 83% so i tried to change it with higher battery % but the seller told me he canot garantee that so i returned it back"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Takes excellent pictures"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Definitely a refurbished phone. Giving 4/5 stars cause it had some small scratches on the screen (not screen cover) and the corners of phone. Had to put a new screen protector on cause it was damaged and the phone was really dirty when I got it. Had to deep clean it. Not a real iphone charger, but it works. Anyhow, the phone works, cameras work, microphone and sound work, but battery life a little low. Suggest getting a new SIM card from carrier since the old one won‚Äôt work in it. Overall, good phone, but considering all the other stuff, price could have been lower."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone looks really good. No signs of use. Everything works great. I was able to switch my SIM card into it with no problems. I‚Äôve had the phone for 4 months now and it‚Äôs still working just fine."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Decent"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This came fast, works perfectly, has 100% battery capacity and was a great bargain. Will shop Olympic Wireless again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was perfect! No defects/scratches/signs of use, etc.It's perfect and has great battery life. I had to charge my previous iphone constantly throughout the day. This one lasts me all day with many hours of use, daily.Definitely recommend!The only thing I'd say is that it isn't as green as it seems like it would be (based on the pictures). Even in good lighting the green looks a little more gray.But still love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got here fast, uploaded quickly, all good!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","At first I was going to return it cause it was smaller than the 11 but after putting my case on and accepting it I Decided to keep it, it works just like new and I was originally trying to get my services through boost mobile as I was a customer with them for years but this phone was not compatible with boost so I went to metro and everything pretty much went smooth. No scratches , dents or anything wrong with the sound it works just like new. For half of the price"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived on time. Looks good. Takes horrible pictures. The quality is poor. Reverted to my previous iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","If you thinking about making a purchase this seller I would recommend, ordered my phone and received it in 2 days, when opening the box the phone came with a power cable and charging block the phone looked brand new with only 1 small scratch on the left corner. Other than that everything works 100% phone was completely unlocked no issues getting service through a provider, I‚Äôm glad I made this purchase saved me over $500 I would highly recommend this seller.Notes: battery health 90%, with tiny corner scratch and came with a screen protector already installed.5 star product, very fast shipping, safe buy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the phone in March. It arrived in decent condition; the audio was always a little wonky but it was passable. Last week, the phone just died and would not turn on. It‚Äôs still dead and I ended up purchasing a new phone. Moral of the story; purchase some type of extended warrant coverage. I contacted the seller on here and was told they have a 90 day guarantee and since it‚Äôs been more than 90 days there‚Äôs nothing they can do."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone works so its a W fr..got ghost touch 2 months after but im gon get it fixed fr;-;"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great phone, battery is on the older side but to be expected, excellent condition aside from a couple small marks, good seller communication."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Item standout. Delivery was state-of-the-art. The packaging was very, very well-chosen. Recommended."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My phone came in perfect condition. No scratches or nicks at all. The battery is at 93% health which is alright with me. This is a big jump for me from iPhone 6s to 11 Pro.The display is really nice and the face recognition is a great feature. It was easy to switch sims and transfer data over. I opted to go for renewed premium because of the year long replacement/warranty and the better quality of the phone. The premium was a pricey jump but who knows what could happen to a used phone within a year so I think it‚Äôs worth it.Altogether it is right in the middle of expensive and affordable. The phone has been working near identical to a brand new 11 Pro and I‚Äôve been very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Minimal physical scratches, almost like new and so far works well. battery life came at 85%. overall I'm pleased with the purchase as there are no issues thus far"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like the phone but a month ago I switched cases to a case that has its own screen protector and removed the INSTALLED screen protector that came with the phone which revealed tons of scratches which is upsetting. the phone looked perfect except for how bad the screen looks without a protector on"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone itself is great. No obvious scratches, speakers look clean, camera works great, etc. I‚Äôve had no issues with the phone, and I think it‚Äôs a great value for the money. That being said, phones under this condition are supposed to have battery health above 90% and this one came to me at 89%. Not a huge deal except that they did say that it would be above 90 and it wasn‚Äôt. That being said, the battery lasts me easily all day and can even get me through two days depending on my usage. Overall, great phone. No regrets"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Shipping took a little longer then expected but other than that the iPhone 11 Pro looks brand new out of the box‚Ä¶ battery looks to be at 100% even got lucky enough that it has AppleCare+ theft and loss until august 1st of this yearI would hands down buy from Amazon again as long as it‚Äôs (renewed premium)$649.99 for an iPhone 11 Pro 512gb isn‚Äôt to bad in todays 2nd hand market‚Ä¶ got it as a gift for my older sister who‚Äôs birthday is coming up"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good quality, good customer service, battery life okay, cosmetically good, product as described.Declutter did have prompt replies to my inquiries. However they could not comply with my request to leave the product at the door. Fortunately, I was home to sign for the item."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo esta en muy buenas condiciones, solo por un desgaste esperado la bater√≠a no es tal cual si fuera nueva, la c√°mara es excelente y permite hacer todas las operaciones de busqueda, consulta, registro y descarga en forma muy √°gil, el tama√±o es otro aliado sin tener un formato muy grande, usa toda la supeficie disponible, en resumen un muy buena opci√≥n de compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased an iPhone 11 Pro 256 gb Renewed Premium. Item was in a like new condition. Physically as was described. Was very very disappointed though when I checked the battery health and found that it was 88% and not the 90+% as stated for Renewed Premium phones. Contacted Amazon and was given a discount. Still love doing business with them‚Ä¶Facial recognition is quick, battery life is left to question‚Ä¶Maybe need to tweak settings. Overall good value. Just need to give customers what is advertised."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Despite all the negative reviews I saw on amazon my product arrived a week late but it was as advertised it had a brand new Apple certified battery minimal scratches on the phone and everything was in good working order. Definitely worth it if you are looking to get an iPhone 11 pro but don't want to pay the price for a new one,and I would recommend it over the iPhone 12 pro just because of the better battery and the fact that 5G is not available in most areas especially the ultra wide band high speed one so if you can live without the 5G this is definitely the phone to pick up, and the cameras are absolutely amazing I was blown away with how well they performed in the dark, these are the best iPhone cameras I've seen yet, I would like to compare them to a pixel at some point but make no mistake this is an amazing camera. As a photographer I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to take good pictures with as little hassle it's not a replacement for a DSLR camera but it's a great camera to have in your pocket and to shoot on the spot."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was really nervous and skeptical about ordering such an expensive item online. But i was not disappointed at all. The phone arrived in only 3 days! The phone was neatly and securely packaged. I seen some peoples reviews state that this company lies and these phones are not new and they have scratches etc. THEY ARE REFURBISHED - which means they have been used, and so some amount of scratching/dings should be expected. With that being said, there is only one very light scratch on the phone i received and can only be noticed if you are really looking for it. It is unlocked for all carriers as it states. It does not come with a sim card! YOU HAVE TO BUY A SIM CARD FROM THE PROVIDER YOU WANT TO USE. This isnt a big deal at all, i was able to purchase one from my provide (Boost Mobile) for $10.00 - i mention this only so that if you plan to buy this phone, buy a sim card from your provider at the same time, so you dont have any delays when you try to activate the phone.In conclusion - definitely worth the money and I'm so happy i went ahead and bought this phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love it only thing is my wifi keeps dropping and I‚Äôm missing calls and messages on WhatsApp idk why"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am happy with the purchase so far, I was only concerned with the battery life but it seems like holding pretty good."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Awesome"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like the fone so far but the charger that it shipped with does not work. I thought I would be getting a fast charger since it is the pro version."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This was from the ""Amazon Renewed Store"" but is actually shipped by a company called TechExchange in Brooklyn NY. The phone comes in a pretty unimpressive generic box. The phone had some plastic sheet sticker over it and came with a cheap aftermarket ""Shark brand"" charging adapter and Shark lighting cable.The phone itself was in EXCELLENT condition! There were some dust on the corners of the camera bump but that was easily cleaned. Finally, there was a bit of slight scratches on the metal border. Totally reasonable for a used phone, especially since I will be putting it in a case anyways! Finally the battery was a whopping 94% health! The listing guaranteed 80% battery health so 94% was far better than I expected! The battery life is the true indicator of the age of the phone which means it was very lightly used. Obviously your mileage will vary but I would not hesitate to buy this again in the future. If it's a bad condition phone, just return and rebuy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was a little worried to purchase this phone due to the mixed reviews. My main concern was battery life and was really hoping they‚Äôd send me one with 90-100% - once it got to me I was so shocked to see it had 100% battery life! The quality of this phone overall is exceptional for the price I paid and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I would definitely consider buying from this company again ‚Äî thank you so much!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Por el momento todo se encuentra a la perfecci√≥n, talvez el micr√≥fono se escucha un poco bajo pero nada que no sea tolerable, muy buena compra y buen vendedor llego muy r√°pido, si pudiera criticar algo seria el cargador, te env√≠an uno gen√©rico chino muy malo. El vendedor es HybridIT"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything about the phone itself was great. Delivered in excellent condition and good protective packaging. The only thing that bothered me was the charger cable was garbage and in less than two weeks I had to get a replacement."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is my first Iphone and will most likely be my last; what a pain in the wazoo. Phone itself is a disappointment with ""renewed"" battery to 87%, not the 90% promised. Also, it's been around the block a time or two, too many Apple ID's created with this phone so had to talk with Apple and get that straightened out. Cosmetically, it looks OK and seems to work OK, too but, I won't do this again."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Imagine my surprise when I transferred my number to find out that the company didn‚Äôt use a genuine apple screen to replace the screen. While the phone is working fine now, I‚Äôm concerned that it may not with future updates. I‚Äôll keep the phone now but may have to change my review in the future. Not feeling so great about this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Received this as a gift. Easy to set up and use as I‚Äôm a previous iPhone user. It was as easy as taking out my old SIM card and inserting it! My husband got this for me as I love to take pictures but I haven‚Äôt been too impressed with the camera. Portrait mode is only beautiful when there‚Äôs plenty of light and the object is still has frozen water. Anything else and the quality is terrible. I heard night mode is beautiful but honestly I don‚Äôt see much of a difference from an iPhone 6s! The video quality is great and movements in video is good. I have enjoyed the editing that can be done directly on the phone. I do miss the home button off older versions. This new one uses Face ID which is not always useful as your phone has to be aimed at your face! Most of the time I have to use the passcode. Not sure if the things I‚Äôm complaining about is because it‚Äôs not a brand spankin new iPHone 11pro or it‚Äôs just the iPhone 11pro!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Really enjoy this, especially the improve3d camera features."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was nervous because of some reviewers who got scratched or defective phones, but I got a very good one!! If anything happens I will update the review. The phone looks like new, works great and got it with 88% battery life. So far I am very happy.UPDATE: After 10 days, still running perfect. Battery last very well. It does not have enough signal strength as my previous phone, a galaxy Note 8, which gave me all 3 or 4 bars inside home, this iphone only gives me 1, but I have no issues making or receiving phone calls."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in an off brand box but was nicely placed and had protection covering front and back. The phone also came with a free screen protector already placed on the phone which is appreciated. Happy with my purchase!! I recommend!"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great phone, looks literally brand new even though is refurbished."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It made me nervous to buy such an expensive ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù item, so I‚Äôm happy to report this looks like a brand new phone - not a single scratch or any sign of having been used. The only complaint I have (which is with Apple not the seller nor Amazon) is that the battery health is only 84%. For an iPhone 11 that seems like quite a deterioration. My iPhone 7 was at 84% when I replaced it with this. It does seem to lose battery life faster than I thought it would.

All the apps I use uploaded fine, no problem with the software update. Bluetooth connection worked, connected to WiFi.

A generic charging wire and block were included and the phone was totally unlocked and ready for me to link to my prepaid provider.

I‚Äôve only just gotten this phone so I will update if it breaks down or has issues. So far, so good. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I could not get my product to connect to ANY service. We could not use the phone unless it was connected to Wi-Fi and at that we still couldn‚Äôt dial out. I‚Äôm waiting on a return slip hopefully the next one will work."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo muy bien con el telefono llego a muy buen tiempo super buen estado si lo recomiendo al 100"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","When buying this know they do not replace the battery my phone came in with 80% battery health"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Upon receiving this phone, I was glad that I didn‚Äôt see any scratches or marks in the screen or the back. But the anti-dust mesh next to front microphone gave away the secret. It seemed badly aligned and the color of the mesh wasn‚Äôt even uniform throughout. It is small but my eyes caught it quick!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was pleasantly surprised when my new (to me) iPhone 11 Pro arrived. It was in perfect condition & I could not find one flaw on any of the surfaces. I set my old iPhone 6S next to it and all the information transferred seamlessly, removed the SIM card from the old phone and inserted it in the new phone and was up and running in 15 minutes. It has been one week since this and the phone works like new except the battery health is 86% but, it is a used phone and I am OK with that. I will replace the battery at some time in the future. The camera in this phone is light years ahead of my iPhone 6S and I might just stop carrying my point-and-shoot cameras for most situations. I would definitely purchase another phone from this seller in the future based on this experience."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased the iPhone 11pro directly from Amazon as the merchant. Decided since the item is a renewed item that I‚Äôm better off doing the renewed premium which guarantees minimum 90% battery life and all minimum wear and tear. ‚ÄúLike New‚Äù product. Received the phone and battery was 82% the volume down button was Stuck and the speakers on the bottom of the phone did not work. I tried making a phone call and put it on speaker and no voice came out. Same day I received the item I requested a return. They tried offering an 80.00 discount which for a phone over 500.00 was not much. The Carrier picked the Item the next morning and it was delivered to the return facility within a few days. Amazon return policy on the platform when I inquired stated 3-5 business days after the return center receives the item. When speaking to a rep via chat they stated it can take up to 30 days for it to arrive and process a refund from the return center which conflicts with the refund guidelines stated on their FAQ. Very disappointed not only are they holding my funds I am also without a cell phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bit bummed out about the battery life. It was at 84% so off user properly winner last the entire day which is not convenient at all. Besides that the phone was in pristine condition and was quite impressed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Perfect condition!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo super hasta el momento con el telefono super nitido bateria palabra para describirlo CALIDAD. el unico detalle que tengo es que al momento que realizaron el cobro no lo hicieron como solicite en mi moneda no en US eso me trajo bastante problemas al momento de hacer el cambio y pago a dolares con mi tarjeta. por el resto CALIDAD pero con eso si tienen que explicar un poco mejor esa situacion."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was nervous to receive a beat up, scratched or damaged phone but ended up being pleasantly surprised.

Not a scratch in the screen, no biffs, no bangs, no dents, no port damage, the apple logo on the back does have few little surface scratches but no biggie there.

The buttons on the side look and work great, the camera works well, no dead pixels and the screen is very responsive so far. GPS seems to work correctly. Speakers sound great on calls and with music. WiFi and cellular calling and data works well and is fast, much better than My previous iPhone X.

The only downside I‚Äôve seen so far is that the phones battery‚Äôs maximum capacity is at 89% meaning that the battery won‚Äôt last as long as it would from a ‚Äúnew‚Äù battery from a full charge.

Overall a Great value, better than buying new from apple.
512GB to store photos, videos, music, games and lots of space for apps. Best phone I‚Äôve had yet.
I‚Äôm happy with My purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The best"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Speaker voice was not clear, speaker‚Äôs net was very very dirty, I cleaned it by spit and issue solved‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Producto recibido en condiciones adecuadas y en tiempo requerido. Muchas gracias"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo √∫nico que no me gusto que en una esquina vino como con pega, lo pude limpiar con cuidado pero es como que tenia cerdas de brocha que tuve que sacar con cuidado, de ah√≠ todo en orden"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me impresion√≥ la calidad del celular vino pr√°cticamente como nuevo, no tiene rayones y la bater√≠a estaba al 99% la pantalla cambia en bien en los modos True Tone y la c√°mara esta bien. Muy recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fast Shipping- arrived a day early which was appreciated! the power cord and charging cable that was supplied did not function as promised, the phone functions acceptably and so far has no issues.
I ordered the 11pro in green, in EXCELLENT condition, it came with a glass screen protector still applied from the last user. the phone was dirty as well.
The one thing I am challenged with is even though it was ordered in excellent condition, there are nicks and dings on the chassis, scratches on the glass and the last user must not have used a case because the corners are etched and dinged, rough like it was dropped a couple times.
I feel like I received a ""good"" or 'fair"" condition phone, but Definitely NOT an EXCELLENT condition phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good deal for the buck. No need spend over price if it's the same device. The downside there's no apple care if you buy it new, headphones and the original packaging charger. But those you can buy care from a 3rd party or take it to a store for repairs. Headphones you can buy it from a 3rd party also a charger. It will also be less than the original price. Is a good way to reduce clutter for our environment. Phone looks new when opening it was amazing. Had 80% battery life which was amazing. Transfering data is so much easier just by having both devices near to each other. It only works if your device is updated with the latest IOS. I will say kinda bad but not much was the color I order was the dark mint green but I got the gold. I wont complain since I was looking first gold but saw it in a different price. So just in case if you really wanted a specific color just keep a look out."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Firewire would not insert easily. So we put under a magnifying glass and noticed some cr..p in there. Along with white paint overspray. Obviously from 'renewing' the white phone. It did arrive on time and was packaged nicely with a 2 port usb charger and shorter firewire cord. The usb block sparked as I put it in the wall outlet. We did not attempt to use that. Used our old apple cord once the junk was removed from the port. Would not take a charge. Sent back immediately for refund. Will make one more attempt at a renewed phone from amazon. But not buying from BuySPRY ever again. Had we looked closer we'd have noticed their horrible ratings."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received the phone today and was extremely happy to replace my water damaged iPhone XS witch had mic and FaceTime issues. Once I put my prepaid Verizon SIM card in the new phone, I couldn‚Äôt make or receive any calls. I checked my the account and it showed my account was all a sudden suspended. I immediately contacted Verizon customer service and was told my account was suspended because the device was reported lost or stolen by ‚ÄúAsurion‚Äù and can‚Äôt be used with Verizon. My SIM card no longer works as it‚Äôs been also flagged for using it in a stolen phone, so now I‚Äôm stuck without a number until I can go and buy and reactive the SIM card on my old phone.

The phone came in great condition no flaws that are easily noticeable. Battery‚Äôs life cycle was at a 100%, it didn‚Äôt come with the authentic ‚Äúbox‚Äù or most importantly the authentic fast charger/cable. The SIM card tray on all iPhones will have a small print of the MEID which will match the MEID in the phones menu. My tray had a completely different MEID to what‚Äôs on the phones menu.

Don‚Äôt be fooled with the high ratings. Most of the issues are not even noticeable to the majority. 9/10 of the iPhones sold from this seller is originally Verizon and blacklisted, BUT! Not the type you would easily notice. Verizon iPhones come factory unlocked from Verizon. If a stolen Iphone doesn‚Äôt have iCloud and is unlocked, typically this phone wouldn‚Äôt work with any of the major carriers that require the MEID to be linked with the SIM card. However many phones that are reported lost/stolen are sold overseas as most countries don‚Äôt tie the MEID with SIM card like we do and one can just plug the SIM card and your ready to go. This also applys to some of the prepaid networks that we have available. If you have one of those prepaid accounts you won‚Äôt notice that your phone is actually reported stolen and that once you try to switch carriers you‚Äôll be buying a new phone.

Plus, Not to mention that, one would buy an iPhone with insurance and sell it without iCloud. The buyer would be happy for a couple of months until the seller decides to claim it‚Äôs lost/stolen and receives a new phone while the other get blacklisted, just like what happed to the phone I received."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this is a gift for my girlfriend. The condition is more like used, instead of refurbished‚Ä¶The phone came with a screen protector on it (which I thought was kinda odd). Took it off to replace with a privacy protector, and behold, the phone as TWO deep scratches on the screen. Not minor scratches, but actual deep scratches. That‚Äôs why these ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù phones come with screen protectors on them already.

Good news is that you can return it for a full refund.

I was going to return it for a refund, but my girlfriend is happy with it. I plan on replacing the screen for her once it gets used up anyways.

BUT BEWARE!! Your phone will most likely have deep scratches on it under the screen protector. I bought a refurbished note 10 plus and the phone was absolutely flawless! But that‚Äôs not the case here, like I said, the condition is more like used instead of refurbished.

If you do buy one, make sure you take off the screen protector it comes with and inspect for scratches!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My doubts about their doing a real refurbishing are pretty strong. Apparently, they didn't even do a basic exterior cleaning properly.

The SIM Card remover tool was not included as advertised.

I brought the item basically unopened to Best Buy for assistance in setting it up. The first thing that the GEEK Squad tech rep. noticed was that there was ear wax in the ear piece area, and the microphone area was dirty. Since I watched him clean those areas with an alcohol swab, I know that was the case. Had I not needed the phone immediately, I would have returned it to the seller.

There were no visible blemishes on nor damage to the case. The functions appear to be working properly, and the battery seems to keep its charge for quite awhile. None of that proves refurbishing nor eases my concerns.

...but time will tell. I only hope that, if time proves this to be a dud, that it happens within the allowed return period. A company that instills doubts instead of confidence in its customers has a real problem."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered this excellent condition phone and got a not so excellent phone. The screen had deep scratches under the new screen protector that was installed. The battery life was 78% (not the minimum of 80%). The seller wanted me to send pictures of the scratches and battery life of the phone they sent me. Too much confusion with this company. DON'T BUY FROM THEM!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was super skeptical about buying this phone because of all the reviews. But I needed one ASAP badly because my old phone was hanging on a thread. Anyway, it came in a timely manner. The phone has NO SCRATCHES or DENTS! It was pretty much like brand new. It came with a charger! Everything was perfect! I‚Äôm so glad I decided to buy from this seller despite the reviews!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I order the wrong model"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I don't blame the people who sell these items. I personally never owned an I phone and tried going the cheaper route so I'd say I'm the one to blame. The phone looked brand new for something that was used. Just returned because it wasn't what I wanted got my refund. Definitely need to be knowledgeable before purchasing bigger items like these. But it was great phone looked new and came with a charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The only defect I was able to find was a little scratch on the screen (which I hate but with the screen protector you can't see it anymore, and they said that ""there are no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm's length"" so that was true), apart from that looks absolutely perfect. The battery came in 89% (not bad but not perfect), the description of the product says that I would come over 80% so they kept their word in that as well. I have been using it for a couple of days and everything works perfectly.
I genuinely believe this was a good purchase.
I suggest you to pay attention to the descriptions of the product, they explain the characteristics of the phone, the accessories and the box you are receiving and they do keep the promise.

If you don't agree with the characteristics they are promising, just don't buy."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I don't buy the latest and greatest - over three years ago, I bought my 1st cell phone (work gave me a 5s), and was sticker-shocked by the cost of an apple-certified 16Gb 6s for $300. So naturally, I made it last as long as I could. My battery is now at 70% health, and dies quite quickly whenever I do anything that isn't texting or calling.
Now that the 12s are out, I decided I would get the best last-model, and began searching for an 11 pro. After reading reviews of this seller, I was a little leery to get something that might have visible scratches on the screen, or have hardware/software issues - As you can see in the photos, I have no issues yet. The screen/body are unblemished, and so far, no fatal errors in use. If anything pops up, I will come back and comment.
While I feel for the people who had issues with their referbished model arrive with errors, I would recommend it. Hey, if there's an issue, Amazon has a return policy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This was ordered by someone not to be on my account so it was returned. This still made me rate it so I did 5 star?? Didn't know what to dom"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôve had this phone one day so far. I upgraded from the 7plus. It feels heavier in the hand. I don‚Äôt mind it at all. I got it for the color haha it came at 87% for the battery health. The battery life is good so far. It doesn‚Äôt die fast like my last phone did. I think the price was decent. There was no visible damage to the phone. I‚Äôd definitely buy a phone again from the seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I read the reviews and was kinda skeptical to order from them at first but I did anyway and I am extremely happy with my order. My phone looks practically brand new. It has no scuff marks, scratches, or anything. The sound quality of the pro and pro max (my wife has this one) is nowhere near that of the 11 itself, but that is an apple flaw. Anyway I am happy with my purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Sin detalles!! Excelente estado parece totalmente nuevo. Bater√≠a al 91%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôve just received my order: an iPhone 11 pro, ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù, and was hoping I could leave a good review about the whole experience.

However, I have to say I am very disappointed due to the conditions the cellphone came in - it seems it was poorly inspected. For being a ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù, I was expecting it to come in better physical conditions. As soon as I opened it, I realized it has some scratches in the camera frames, and the sticky plastic cover was dirty with hair, as though the cellphone had been unboxed many times. In addition, the battery health is 87%. I was expecting at least 90%, as the description says: ‚Äúat least 90% battery life‚Äù. I think I was sent only a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù and not a ‚Äúrenewed premium‚Äù.

As a loyal Amazon customer, I request a proper solution for this problem.

Please let me know if I need to provide further details. I did not find a way to contact the seller directly"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got what I ordered for my boyfriends birthday present. Phone is in good condition but it was pretty dirty, would‚Äôve been nice if it was clean."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I liked the features and the freshness of the phone. Easily handable and you can get used to it pretty easily"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is just as the description. Battery was at 88%. I‚Äôve been using it for 2weeks and all is going well."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything was perfect, absolutely no issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Perfect condition!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","pretty cool phone I just had one issue with the camera half of it was pink I just reset the phone then it worked fine"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came packaged nicely and is working well. This is my first iPhone and so far I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything works great on this phone except for the fact that the alarm doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I am up at 4 AM every morning and the alarm has no sound. It doesn‚Äôt matter what ringtone or how loud I make it, it doesn‚Äôt work. I rely on it and I actually had to go and buy an alarm clock because my phone doesn‚Äôt work in this aspect. Disappointed. I had an iPhone 8 plus it was a few years old and I never had a problem with any of that."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I tough the tray for the sims card was missing but its there, beautiful phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great phone, would buy again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It is really in good condition but second day I noticed that call volume is too weak. You are hearing something in so much low volume, you can not speak at the outside. Maybe you can hear something at home barely. I returned and waiting for refunding. I really wanted to have a phone like that in good condition. Sorry for refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôve had no issues with this phone yet and it‚Äôs been well over a month since I‚Äôve purchased. Solid investment"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","In great working condition, fast shipping"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had to clean gunk out of the cracks and out of the speaker holes. It had clearly not been even remotely cleaned as there was food residue from someone‚Äôs fingers still ON the back. These random lines started appearing on the side of the screen after about a month of use and it is spreading more with time."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Un producto restaurado de muy buena calidad ya he comprado uno anteriormente y tengo dos a√±os y sigue funcionando sin ning√∫n problema y sobre lo est√©tico se miran como nuevos , creo q tienen un buen filtro de control de calidad. Compre en otro lugar por 20 d√≥lares menos pero lo devolv√≠ por el mal estado q se miraba por fuera"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything is good but the battery life even though I charge it max everytime"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buyer beware, I would give a 0 star review if I could:

My ""as new, renewed"" iphone 11 Pro arrived, shiny and beautiful looking like new, no scratches on body or screen, BUT: the screen was not attached to the phone properly, a big gap at the left side that I could see into and slide a nickel under.... phone also became nuclear hot within an instant of being pugged in to charge.... not a good sign... so I applied for a refund.... it did however have 87 % battery health, but not sure what that means if it is leaking radiation from heat and the phone body not being the original parts or sealed in any way....

however, seller seems legitimate, they wanted to repair it or replace it initially, but quickly I lost my trust of second hand renewed phones and prefer to pay more for one that is new and comes with a year or more warranty... so, they issued my refund today for the full amount, apparently will land in my account in few days...

BUT: they did not provide return shipping or a label when asked, so, contrary to Amazon policy, I had to pay 10 dollars for shipping and I am not being reimbursed this.. overall, a poor shopping experience and a waste of money and time.... also, the phone arrived in a cardboard box, no bubble wrap or protective packaging.... surprising for a 500 dollar item...

Beware that these phones may seem like a good idea, but it may not be worth it in the long run."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got a nice iPhone 11 with no cracks or scratches. The only downside I can think of is that it is at 84% battery life but other than that it‚Äôs awesome. The seller is also very accommodating and helpful if you need anything or have any questions."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","After reading some of the bad reviews and I was a little hesitant to buy from this vendor but decided to anyways. I'm glad I did. My phone is in great shape. It looked almost new. only one very minor smudge on the back. It was no big deal because I always use a case. The phone is in great working order and takes awesome pictures."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything was perfect. The battery was completely dead upon arrival would be my only complaint."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is a step up from my 6 phone so a few new features to learn but so far so good. Good condition, love the color. And it told me when I had a spam call which was great. I have other refurbished items that are still serving me well - I expect this phone to be one as well."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","When I originally purchased the device, I was beyond excited. The phone arrived two days earlier than the expected delivery date and was in pristine condition for it being used. There were a few noticeable scratches on the corners of the phone but the screen and the cameras were not scratched at all. It also came with 85% battery life left. Overall I was incredibly happy with my purchase.However, only after a month of use the display suddenly gave out. The phone was still working as I could use my Apple Watch to send and receive messages, however the screen was pixelated at first and then went completely dark a day later and did not turn back on.Since I am still within my 90 day window I have requested a replacement device. I am a little frustrated since I am without a phone currently and my phone was suppose to arrive 7/14. The last two days I have received emails stating that my device will arrive later than originally expected and it still has not even shipped yet. I will be going out of town this weekend and was hoping to have a phone by then but it is looking like that won‚Äôt happen. Clearly have some disappointments.Would love to have been able to rate 5 stars but I am hopeful that when I receive the replacement phone it will work better and last longer than the previous one. I will update my review after I have a chance to review the new device."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was a little dirty when I got it. Definitely make sure you sanitize it. It came with a screen protector but I honestly believe that was to ‚Äúmask‚Äù the scratches on the screen. Battery health is 88%. Overall I still think it was a decent buy to be a used phone. I would buy again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","everything that was said would be included, was included; the phone, a charger, the charger cube, some instructions, and a paperclip to remove the sim card from your old phone to the new phone. the battery life is at 86% which isnt bad. and they even put a screen protector on it!! overall, very happy with this purchase!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm in love with this phone!!! Was very awesome!!! Such an upgrade from at iPhone 8plus. Camera is amazing!! And then it‚Äôs been amazing!!! I have no complaints so far!!! Will update soon! But it‚Äôs been a good phone switched easy. No scratches no nothing that I seen!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone arrived a couple hours before it said it would. It‚Äôs in perfect condition! It freezes up from time to time but that could just be because my storage is full. HIGHLY recommend. My only complaint is that the battery only charges to 96% but the battery stops lasts about 6 hours when fully charged."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","it was only 500 bucks and it‚Äôs like brand new! the battery life is great, everything about it is great, the only thing is it didn‚Äôt come with an actual apple charger but nonetheless it‚Äôs a great deal and the phone is spectacular. i recommend for anyone who needs a quick phone or something. i love it so much!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Renewed with non genuine parts in my case it's the battery, I'm sure it's not because they want to but because of apple. it says vigorously tested on the package yet my speaker volume is extremely low and haven't been able to solve that through settings so you get what you pay for I guess"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No cosmetic defect visible on phone and screen. Everything works fine. Generic charger and adapter in the box which was expected. Only concern was Max battery capacity showing 90% during opening, a few weeks of usage Max capacity has now decreased to 88%. Thinking will have to change battery soon. Overall good buy thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This seller is great very fast shipping guys I love them"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good quality and in good condition for a refurbished phone. Really happy with my purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good buy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone arrived neatly packed, with all the claimed accessories. It even had some of the original stickers which made it feel like I was the first person using this phone. Set up was very easy, no issues whatsoever, and the best part was that I did not have to wait for this package at all (super fast delivery). Amazing product, will be looking at this seller for future purchases.Writing this review from my recently purchased iPhone 11 Pro Max. :)"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","It works perfectly and mi wife loves it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good phone! Battery life at 85% but that‚Äôs all my iPhone XR was at before switching and didn‚Äôt have many problems with it. That and a couple scratches around the edges are my only complaints- better than $450 for cracked ones on Facebook marketplace! I would buy another phone off here!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great product. My phone was received with no scratches and looks brand new. It also came with a screen protector already on it. It was unlocked and easy to set up."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Amazing phone came in perfect condition no scratches no nothing everything works great battery life is AMAZING.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was kind of leery in purchasing a used phone, but decided that the price was affordable and an upgrade to my IPhone 6 (right). This phone has been amazing and the new features I can do (wireless charging for one). I would recommend this product and the seller as well."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love the new stuff iPhone and the one offer to get like that never happened thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone came in perfect condition looks new, its unlocked as described, came with cable and box for outlet to charge, seems to be working as expected but time will tell and I will update my responses then so far so good. Battery life at 90 percent. Face recognition works well just rework a lil time for it to read Apple Watch 6 but got it after resetting a couple times. I bought phones on Amazon before an this the only one CEO sends email of who to contact and making sure phone was perfect nice to know that if I need help I have link to contact with having to try to find them or having to go through Amazon return first."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is in good shape and everything works, however the max battery life is already depleted to the point of it telling you it needs to be replaced. If the phone was ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù like it said that should have been taken care of‚Ä¶ other than that it‚Äôs a good phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bien cuidado esta como nuevo sin ningun golpe"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es un tel√©fono usado sin duda alguna, lo de casi nuevo en entredicho. Por un poco m√°s hubiera podido comprar un nuevo, satisfacci√≥n 7/10."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got one of the two switched over wife hasn‚Äôt got hers switched yet very happy with mine."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I already had an iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB model that I bought the day it first came out at the Apple Store. I paid $1245 for that phone brand new, but I upgraded it to iOS 13.4.1 which made it incompatible with a game controller I‚Äôm using for streaming.

For less than $980, I purchased a Renewed iPhone 11 Pro 512GB model from BuySpry which still has iOS 13.3.1 which works with my controller.

So yeah I‚Äôm happy I got more storage capacity at a cheaper cost than my original phone. The screen looks great (no scratches / came with screen protector preinstalled) and the battery life is just as good as my original iPhone 11 Pro.

The only caveats: (1) Doesn‚Äôt come with original box or accessories. (2) I can‚Äôt buy additional AppleCare coverage for this sweet device.

Next time I upgrade I‚Äôll probably get a bigger screen model iPhone (the Pro Max model).

Thank you!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ordered two iPhone 11 Pros with 512gb memory. Two weeks in and phones are excellent. One came with 98% battery and one came with 85% battery. Each was near new. One had a screen crack that was perhaps 1mm, like someone poked it with a tack in the center. Both came with tempered glass protectors installed over the screens (probably coincidence). We are pleased"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone works perfectly fine it came with no scratches but a few fingerprints on the screen that I cleaned off, battery life 100% perfect condition doesn‚Äôt lag or anything and I‚Äôve waited 10 days to give this review. The only thing is just last night the charger that was provided burned while I was sleeping it burned my back and my bedsheet."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Saw the first review giving one star and there isn't enough reviews to form a solid decisive at first glance. So yeah, I hesitated a little especially when it's a $1k purchase . With the iPhone presented as ""like new"" condition, I went with it knowing that Amazon got my back with the buyer protection program.

Received the phone within a couple of days. Bam! Everything looked like new. Charging cable and EarPods looked untouched. Phone came with the sticker covering the screen so I peeled it off. Turned on the phone - everything worked. Battery health check showed 100%. Went to sprint store, got me a SIM card and activated this new iPhone.

For some Apple enthusiasts, it may be a dealbreaker because this iPhone came with a generic phone box. To me, I don't give a ship as long as I get all the phone equipment.

Anyway, I have this silver 512gb one for 2 weeks now. No complaints. Satisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in 2 days early and i was gonna order a screen protector but the phone came with one on it already. The phone had no scratches anywhere on the phone and it looked brand new the battery health was at 98 percent which is way better then i thought it would be ive been using it for the past 3 days with no issues at all i highly recommend buying from this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone itself is great with extremely minimal scuffing. My only complaint is the charger that came with the phone does not work basically at all. It is useless. Very happy with the phone. I purchased unlocked and it works with my Verizon SIM card."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not the best first impression. Box was torn, protective film on the phone had been removed and had finger grease all over it. Camera lenses had adhesive covering them. I cleaned it all up and transferred everything over and it seems to function 100% with 87% battery health. Just seems like someone else had gotten this phone then returned it and Amazon just sent it to me. I paid $70 extra for the ‚ÄúAmazon Premium‚Äù renewed phone too."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This Phone came in 1 week after buying. I was a little skeptical but it came like brand new. There is some scratches but they are not visible. The only downside is the battery came in at 84% but it‚Äôs not that bad."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A huge disappointment. I understood that buying a refurbished phone could be a risk, but I figured that it should be pretty safe in this case, being on Amazon and having a bunch of good reviews. Big mistake on my part.

I started setting up the phone the very same day I received it. During the set-up, the phone kept spontaneously shutting down, but I figured this had to do with the fact I was in the lengthy process of transferring my information from an Android phone. This continued for *literally* hours until I finally gave up and decided not to transfer ANYTHING from my old phone just so that I could set up this new one. The spontaneous shut-downs continued until, by the end of the night, the phone would not even power on again.

At this point, I knew that I should just return the phone, but according to the seller‚Äôs directions, you must perform a factory reset on the phone before sending it back. I couldn‚Äôt do this because I couldn‚Äôt even turn the phone on at all! I contacted Apple support, and I couldn‚Äôt remotely reset it because I didn‚Äôt have an Apple computer. So, I had to make an appointment at the Apple Store just so they could factory reset it for me so I could send it back and get my $1000 back.

This was in all honesty an absolute nightmare to deal with. A financial risk because it was such a huge purchase (especially to risk getting stuck with once it was broken), and a huge waste of my time (the whole ordeal spanned nearly 2 weeks) trying to set up, then chatting with Apple support, then having to go to the store to reset, then finding a way to send back.

Tl;dr: a nightmare of an experience, would NOT recommend"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La camara funsiona bien y la bateria esta al 100% puedo grabar mis videos en alta calidad"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Such a good phone. I was very nervous about buying this phone. However there were no problems! The battery health was at 100% when i got it. Transferring all the data from my old iphone was very easy but took about 3 hours. It also shipped very fast like less than a day. And it came in 3 days. Took a while to activate the phone but It is very worth the money and time."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My phone arrived 2 days after my purchase. I set the phone up and have been using it for 48 hours with no issues. The condition was like new. The battery life is excellent. Phone was sent with an after market charger and generic box. I am pleased with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased it for my great grandson Christmas gift and he seems to like it. But that was a lot of money for an old phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was received in a sealed original factory box. There were zero scratches or defects in the screen or the body. Phone charged to 100% and works like a new one. Battery life is right on par with new as well. Very good for a renewed phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came perfect, only one issue is when I get a call and put the phone to my ear the screen would bank out and would not respond. Other than that it was ok, wish someone would have reached out to get the issue resolved but no one did"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Parece nuevo todo funcional"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in good condition. Battery life was only at 92 %"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had to buy an older iPhone since my brand new iPhone 12 (5G) (Verizon) would constantly drop calls - this is a known issue at Apple and Verizon on model 12. I even switched to a 4G/LTE sim card to try and fix the issue - nothing I was told to do by Verizon worked.

Frustrated, I purchased this iPhone 11Pro, put the 4G sim card in and it‚Äôs worked flawlessly - just like my old iPhone 6S Plus.
I then sold my 12 for much less but at least my issue is now fixed.

The camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is so much better than the 12 (see ‚Äúmoonset‚Äù image) Aside from a few minor scratches, it‚Äôs like having a new iPhone. I‚Äôm satisfied with this purchase. Hope this helps."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Las esquinas del celular se encontraban con da√±os significativamente apreciables, lleg√≥ demasiado sucio en los bordes, micr√≥fono y parlantes, con una mugre color negra muy dif√≠cil de limpiar. Parec√≠a carb√≥n. El cable y el cargador de muy mala calidad. La bater√≠a se encontraba en un estado normal."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The camera is outstanding."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone works as good as new, battery is good, it actually came unlocked and very clean"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","phone came in generic box without original pakaging or accessories. this wouldn't have mattered at all really but I'm just building up to it. so first of all, I've alway been an android person and never really cared much for apple, but because I never tried it and if it's not broken dont fix it. I mean a smartphone is a smartohone right? wrong, after using my girlfriends old iPhone cuz my phone broke the its simple quality of life improvements that sets apple apart. it's not always as intuitive as you want it to be but it's easy to learn. I was so use to having a back button and a home button. but back to my story, after unboxing I load up my sim card and turn on the phone, logo pops up and powers down right away. so turns out it's not charged... great, whatever. it's been refurbished, that acceptable. no big deal... as I'm charging the iPhone I snap a few photos and show my gf then sweet upgrade. she says why did I get the older model. she says that's not the new iphone... it's actually an iPhone 7 or 8 I believe. but after verifying for myself and double checking the receipt she was right. battery is slightly charged now so i turn on the phone again. I go thru the set up only to find that the phone is still locked to a previous owner and there's no ICCID number... even with sim card in, looked online and everyone said it's a bricked iPhone maybe someone previously tried to 'jailbroken' and bricked it. so now I'm here weiting this review trying to contact the seller before I formally request a refund/return. how does this happen? obviously I knew that ordering something used or refurbished could potentially have risks, but I was thinking, like a small scratch or something.. really fckin crazy that I ended up getting a locked older model. please can you guys double check your orders and maybe find out if I was sent someone elses order. indont see how this happens even with coronavirus going on. if anymore info is needed please email me!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased the phone for use on vacation. I took an island hopping trip in the Philippines. The phone is most definitely a good phone for water sports. I used it in both fresh and saltwater without any issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The device is pretty nice. Didn't come in the original box but the device itself had no damage or scratches, almost like new. The only problem is the charger (generic and certified) after 6 days it started making a noise. It does not happen all the time but I might have to get a new one. Also, the battery life was at 90%. Other than that I'm very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend the seller and the products"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Package Came in 2 days early. Phone is in excellent condition and Battery Health is 97%. For Me it was definitely worth buying. Very satisfied with the purchase. üëåüèæ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this phone as a gift for my wife (who really needs a new phone). Sprung for the unlocked version of the phone in ""Excellent Condition."" Amazon defines that as follows: ""Cosmetic condition: Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away)."" Certainly would've been OK with some mimimal scratches and nicks to the outside of the phone. But its screen, which came with a not well-applied screen protector on it (big bubble in the middle of the screen, so I had to remove it), is scratched maybe more than any phone screen I've ever seen. Like someone rubbed fiberglass across it over and over. Microscratches cover the whole thing. Comical in way. One scratch? Probably woulda kept it. Two? OK, sure. I'm buying a refurbished phone. I get it. 100+? Did the previous owner line his pockets with sandpaper or something?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came in Great condition, with 95% battery health. Passed 3uTools verification tests. Midnight Green Body was shiny and new, very slight screen marks in correct light but new as can get. True Tone, Face ID etc all works. Only annoying thing was cleaning off the glue from the wrapping and there being no sim card tool, but i had one at home. 9.5/10 Very Happy with the buy ( :"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received the iPhone in a non-Apple box, which I don't care for. The content is in excellent condition. You can't ask for more as a ""renew, recertified"" iPhone. I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Product was nice"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great seller, fast shipping, excellent customer service. Product was as described, great condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No sound, speaker sometimes not working, many times visit apple store but no help. All garbage. Do not buy and beware of fraud."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this to replace my iPhone 7 bc the it stopped charging. Transfered everything smoothly and it‚Äôs still working well"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I phone was great except it got scratches in bottom corner, almost feel like someone was forcing it an I phone case and it went down. Works fine, I will think about wait one day of it bothers me so much I may end up returning them in 3 days"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is pretty decent, the battery health was 86% but there were scratches all around the corners of the phone probably caused by a case, there was also a scratch on the screen but it‚Äôs barely noticeable, other than that I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Screen is popping off on all the edges. Leaving big air pockets, making it very difficult to use those parts of the screen. The rest of the phone is exclent!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My first review was in error, my husband is very happy with his phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It‚Äôs been about a month since I made my purchase and the battery life that I received was 87%, there was no scratches no dents no visible marks on the cell phone to be honest I‚Äôm really happy with the purchase and I would definitely recommend using the Amazon premium renewed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is 100% worth the money and will last me years to come. It works like brand new & was promptly shipped in time! Packaged nicely with charger too :) very happy with my purchase & recommend it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo de acuerdo a lo esperado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So the device I ordered was renewed. It was stated to be in ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù condition. To quote two of the bullets in the description:

This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.

This product will have a battery that exceeds 80% capacity relative to new.

I disagree with both of these as shown in my pics/screenshots. Also, the screen honestly as pristine and even tiny scratch free (that I get from my purse & pockets) as it was, combined with the teeny bubbles in the back I assume the screen was previously replaced. I have taken enough items to the Apple Store for repairs to know that if they open it and find third party repairs have been made they won‚Äôt work on it.

This phone had a battery status of ‚Äúservice‚Äù so below the 80% stated. Not worth the hassle of maybe trying to get it replaced and finding out Apple won‚Äôt do it. I returned it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The condition of the phone was great but the battery heath came with only 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have had zero issues with this phone. It works perfectly! I was a little Leary bc if all the bad reviews. I‚Äôm glad I bought it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived a day early that was first great thing everything seems to be good, battery is not holding as long as expected other than that great product clean zero blemishes I would use seller again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","para ser un dispositivo restaurado funciona perfecto y sin imperfecciones el estado seria una A, lo mejor de todo es que viene desbloqueado para poder utilizarlo en todo el mundo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bueno pero la bater√≠a est√° muy baja"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Dislike low battery life, good face recognition"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this phone for my 17 year old and it‚Äôs the second iPhone purchase we‚Äôve made from amazon. Works like new and so much more affordable than thru the providers long term! It came neatly packaged and he had his phone swapped over in less than 5 minutes."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It was delivered 2 days sooner than expected which was nice! I‚Äôm always cautious when buying refurbished phones. but this is my second time doing so through amazon and I am pleased. My silent switch doesn‚Äôt work but there are ways to work around that in settings. My phone arrived with 90% battery health then went down to 87% but I‚Äôm now back at 90%. People have trouble hearing me when i‚Äôm using speaker phone with a case on. I usually use earbuds when on the phone so this doesn‚Äôt bother me much. all small inconveniences which can be easily worked around. over all happy with the phone !!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The product very good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone looks good, no cosmetic damage. Only thing to be aware about is Battery Health and Cycle Counts."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Honestly coming from a guy that has been in the iPhone family all his life I would say this is a really good deal had really no problem except for the audio from taking video bug out on me a couple times but other than that there has been absolutely nothing else wrong no scratches no design flaws great quality great battery life 100% btw and although I would prefer y‚Äôall to get the smaller model cause paying a extra 100 for the larger model seem a little off and I just like the smaller one better it seems more premium to me and bigger is not always better when it comes to phones the smaller one seem big to me anyways"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©ticamente impecable, pero el lado izquierdode la pantalla no funcionaba. Tuve que devolverlo y comprarme otro, y hace 7 d√≠as que lleg√≥ mi devoluci√≥n y sigo esperando a que procesen mi reembolso. Todo mal.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Iphone for all reason it worked real good at first and now it doesn't work properly"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","todo excelente solo llego"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Finger print scanner didn't work, otherwise was as advertised"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","bought this for our son for he had to have the latest phone. so far so good. Not had any issues yet and we gave it to him for Christmas. it was easy to set up and made his own apple account so he can use it own his own. So far he likes it and uses it everyday"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I debated for weeks before buying this IPhone, for fear of buying a dud, but, finally took everyone's advice and gave it a try. I love it. It's one of the best buys of my life. It's battery is full 100%, I can find no problems with it and love being able to Facetime with family and friends around the world, it's like being with them for awhile. I truly love this phone, it's so easy to learn and use and the battery is so long lived that I'm not constantly charging it. Anyone debating trying a refurbished phone can use my advice and think about it positively."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My iPhone 8 died suddenly and with supply chain issues and back orders I would've had to wait for Verizon to get new phones to buy. In a pinch I ordered this and took a chance because it's not cheap. It arrived a day earlier, packaged nicely and at least 90 percent charged. I switched the sim cards and it's been a life saver ever since."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I used Android phone and needed to update my phone. Wife has iPhone x so decided to try iPhone 11 as well as Samsung Android phone.

Not sure what is so special about the iPhone but the way it is architected is horrible. I want to own my data and not have it in the cloud. iPhone defaults to saving everything in their cloud so reconfigured that. Tried to search for a picture and there are no directories (I thought what kind of rubbish is this).

Android is not the best OS but at leas it is architected like a real system. I will continue with an Android phone.

Just to add, I have returned this item and Amazon received the item on a certain date. It is going to be a month in 5 days and still no refund by Amazon. I do not like that they are holding onto my money for so long. I do hope I get my refund or I will have to raise an issue with them."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this for my daughter 5 months ago now and we have not had a single issue. It works perfectly. Came packaged great with a charger. Worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","In general, everything is very good, I will have to send it to a cleaning service, even inside due to how covered the speakers and the microphone are with dirt."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone on Amazon shows up as refurbished but it is basically brand new, only a few minor acratches on the side. Overall this phone is worth the money."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone works good, only issue the speakers don‚Äôt work that well! Sounds like it went through a washing machine. Hopefully easy cheap fix"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was a bit wary at first trying Amazon Renewed with these insanely expensive flagship phones, but with the 90 day return window and the battery and condition guarantees I figured what did I have to lose?I purchased a Galaxy S10 for myself first and I was so pleased with it I got my dad this iPhone 11 Pro soon after.I much prefer Android overall personally but when my dad's iPhone 11 Pro showed up I couldn't help but be a bit envious.The cameras and camera software are amazing. And there's something about holding the device in your hand that just exudes quality. It feels so premium and so well made.If you're wondering about picking up this phone from Amazon Renewed, don't hesitate."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I thought the battery life was going to be better, the health said it was at 90 after spending almost $700 I expects a new battery but it gets through about a day and a half with out charging."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Didn't like how Shipping took over a week but overall I love the phone, have to get used to it since I've used Android for a pretty long time. Thank you for your honesty! I recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Nice and clean and everything things work"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Al principio estuve con un poco de miedo porque no hab√≠a comprado nunca un tel√©fono caro y mucho menos que haya sido reacondicionado, pero, sin dudas, ha sido una gran compra.Felicitaciones a los distribuidores de Hibryd IT, √©pico el celular! Luce como nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone arrived on time and in exceptional condition. The notes say it was handed to a person or receptionist. That was inaccurate because it was delivered to a home and left outside the door."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone had alot of scratches around the frame, but the battery health is at 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Still getting used to phone but enjoy fully functional phone now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","When I first opened the phone it came on as a Verizon carrier (the product description indicated that it was fully unlocked for all carriers, and we needed At&T). I put in the SIMS card from the old 7 (upside-down was the only way it would go in ). Still, came up as Verizon. I shot out an email to TRADEMORE asking for help. Meanwhile, I went into iTunes to download what we managed to save. When all the updates and uploading were completed the phone indicated our AT&T carrier. I wrote to TRADEMORE once again to say we had it figured out. They responded the next day. The phone has worked perfectly!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life is low and the device gets really hot. Despite being told that there is a 90 warranty, apple informed me that the warranty had expire prior to purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overall the first day the phone seems to be workig"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone arrived in like-new condition, despite being renewed. There was no previous sign of use. The battery lasts me over a full day of use on a single charge, often seeing over 7 hours of screen-on time, several of which are on maximum brightness while outdoors (which the screen remains remarkably visible in). The battery also arrived at 100% capacity, so it is brand new.I've been very happy with my purchase considering the software and hardware improvements from the 6S that it is replacing.Did I mention it came with a screen protector already on it? Not a single scratch on the housing or screen of the phone. Save yourself a few hundred dollars, buy the phone renewed. If you get a bad one from the bunch, just exchange it - returns are free."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was skeptical about the product's relatively low cost, but the phone is fantastic! I received the color and carrier I wanted, and I'm very satisfied! However, the phone was at 10% battery when you turn it on, and the included charger looked old and a little dirty. Overall, there were only a few minor inconveniences, but it's still a great product nonetheless."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cumpli√≥ las expectativas"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","At first I was a little skeptical because of the comments I read, but overall one of my best purchases so far. There wasn‚Äôt a scratch on the lens, screen or anywhere on the phone which was my biggest fear. Also, the battery life was at 97% which I thought was great since most refurbished phones come at low 90‚Äôs %. I‚Äôve been using this phone for a little over a week and so far so good. Great response time and no lag. I‚Äôll be back to give an update in a couple."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","my fridge is quite old and the ice maker is acting up. I know ill need to replace the fridge bot for now this portable ice maker is working quite well"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Setup was simple although it took a while to complete, phone was charged when I received it, setup easy cloning my old iPhone. It looked and worked like a new not a refurbished phone.
Delivery was fast and package was in good shape when it arrived.
It came with a generic cord and ac charger plug, I have not used either as I have several others."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love this seller. I have purchased 4 phones from this seller in the last two years for me and my children. The phones come brand new to be renewed. The battery is like new with 100% battery life and the phones are packaged like brand new. hey quality is as if you walked into the apple store and bought them. Worth every penny. They also operate as if they are brand new and work like butter. I love this seller. will remain a lifetime customer."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great phone. Arrived in one piece with no scratches. Was easy to set up with my straight talk plan. Been using it for a few months now and pretty happy. The only issue I had was with FedEx and that‚Äôs no reflection on the seller since FedEx in my area is a total mess this summer. I love my phone with its huge storage. I have the 250-ish storage and my old phone was 32gb so I can take as many photos as I want. Very happy :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have to say that it this iPhone looks great! The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt give it a 5 star is because the SIM card slot is not perfectly flush when closed. This makes me concerned about the waterproofing of the phone. I would not trust it‚Äôs waterproofing, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt give it full honors."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buen producto exactamente lo que se alista"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I recently ordered the iphone 11 pro. When I recieved the phone I was very excited and happy because upon further review everything worked good. I went in to my carrier to pick up a SIM card and found out I was unable to. The lady did everything she could but said the pre-existing account had never been canceled. She had to factory reset my phone and it still did not work. Very disappointed and let down. Read the risks before ordering."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The product unfortunately did not come in the original box, but if you read the product description before buying you would know that they did mention some orders would come without that option. They did provide a charger though. For a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù Product this phone was delivered in great condition. There were no scratches nor cracks on my iPhone 11 Pro everything worked perfect from the camera options to just basic browsing. Battery came in at 100% health. Set up was simple. Face-ID works, definitely not a fake phone because the App Store is from APPLE where as fake phones take you to an android App Store and there are other ways you can tell a fake from an original apart."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this renewed phone is. Some reviews scared me a bit but what I received is very nice"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was so excited to finally get a new phone, I was looking forward to Midnight Green as it's one of my favorite colors. I GOT SPACE GREY. Yes. Wrong Color. Very disappointed. I didn't want to hassle with an exchange or return so I decided to just deal with it. It also said AT&T on the box even though I ordered for T-Mobile.

The phone itself is in great shape, no scratches or marks on it. It looks brand new even though it is renewed. The Tech guy at the T-Mobile store was able to activate it and transfer all my stuff to it without any issues even though it said it is a AT&T phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had brought the same iPhone 11 Pro from kiss electronic Inc through Walmart. it was damaged. that‚Äôs why I returned that phone.
But when I ordered the same phone from kiss electronic inc through Amazon. I got a phone just like new. I found everything is okay. I don‚Äôt know why?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No funciona bien la c√°mara cuando abro la c√°mara empieza a temblar y ase un ruido estra√±o adentro voy a tener que regresarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Been using the 11 pro for the past week or since I've gotten it and everything works fine. Battery life is 97% and the only cosmetic defect I notice is a 1 cm long scratch near the bottom of the screen that is barely noticeable. It came with a screen protector already and a charger.

So far I'm batting 2/2 on Amazon Renewed and I look to be buying more products from them in the future. Prime shipping + 3 month return window is just too good a combo, especially with how easy Prime returns are if you have a Kohls nearby."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone is in excellent ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù condition but no one can hear me on the other line of the phone. Can‚Äôt use a phone where no one can hear me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Returning"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm not sure if I am out of my warranty date since it‚Äôs refurbished but there‚Äôs just some things that are not working as they should (sound) for the most part"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is my very first review ever. I was very skeptical about purchasing this device based on the mixed reviews. I want to say my phone is perfect looks brand new. I want to give it 5 stars. However, I am leaving only 4 due to the fact that the battery life is only 91%. I expected 95% or more."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I feel like since I paid this much money for it, it could‚Äôve been almost like new. My phones having problems with the touch screen . It‚Äôs either dragging(slow) or won‚Äôt work at all when I try and exit out of something etc. it‚Äôs not like I can send the phone back because this is all I have to communicate with families and friends during this stressful time, so what can I do about the screen being more up to date or working better when it comes to the touch.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Vida √∫til de bater√≠a 91%

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought this iphone by mistake but the phone is perfect, i return the item and I get my money back, best seller thank you"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Recib√≠ el tel√©fono. Se ve en muy buenas condiciones, pero solo me lleg√≥ el tel√©fono y el cable. No recib√≠ el enchufe"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It works perfectly, but the outside has many imperfections."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","For the price of this phone i‚Äôd recommend it to anyone, especially refurbished. Runs and looks like it‚Äôs brand new, And there was no scratches at all!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It arrived very quickly, and it appeared to be a brand new product."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love the phone the camera system is amazing the phone is 512G I recommend
this phone I purchased 2 I will absolutely buy again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the midnight green iPhone 11 Pro. They delivered it three days earlier than they said they would deliver it. The phone looks great, and so far it well works very well. It came with a charger cord and adapter(not original apple cord or adapter but it works fine). I like how they sent it with a screen protector on the phone, but there is scratch like thing under it. The phone‚Äôs maximum battery capacity is 100%, which is more than I expected. Overall, I am very happy with the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No problems no issues. Charger works. Phone came in great conditions. Everything works. I‚Äôm happy üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not what I had planned on from and iPhone 11"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great product for a good price"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","After getting my iPhone X wet on the lake this summer I was freaking out. I didn't want to purchased a new phone through my carrier and have the additional fees added to my bill. So I decided to do my research, and stumbled across this buyer. I was worried that the phone would come in pretty rough shape. To my surprise it came in very mint condition. I. was able to get the higher Gb iPhone at a fraction of the price. What's great about this company is its backed by a warrantee if anything is wrong with the phone just send it back. Needless. to say I'm really happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this phone for my nephew. Initially the speaker was not working properly and my nephew tried to get it replaced but they didn't have the speaker and advised him to buy an ear pod to use with phone. He bought the ear pods and was using them. The phone started to make a noise each time he was on a call. The noise kept getting louder each time. I tried to get him to return the phone but he wanted to see I'd the noise would stop. He eventually went home to Jamaica with the phone. Now the phone is completely useless. It has overheated and stopped working and even damaged his Sim card.
They refuse to give us a refund and it's only been 2 months!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good deal and amazing service!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me agrado mucho la forma de atenci√≥n al cliente.
Fue bien r√°pido el revolc√≥.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No problems at all, literally exactly the same experience as a brand new iPhone. Zero complaints. Came in two days. Easy to register to metro by T-Mobile, took 15 minutes."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived with 3 very small scratches on the screen that aren‚Äôt super noticeable but they are definitely there. Did not come with any of the original Apple packaging and the packaging that it did come in seemed insignificant for such a fragile and expensive device - thankfully it arrived undamaged but I would buy with caution. Otherwise, it seems to work as well as a new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Okay so the only reason I‚Äôm not rating this higher is that there are micro scratches in the top right portion of the screen, and while the seller makes no mention of condition on their product page it would‚Äôve been nice to know what I was getting myself into. Other than that the phone is in near prestine condition on the body and back glass plus, it‚Äôs nothing a screen protector can‚Äôt cover"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was amazing. Was weary buying a refurbished phone but there was not a single scratch on the phone and it came in just 2 days after ordering it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought phone as a Christmas present for my wife. Phone ear speaker does not function properly. At max volume, you can bearly hear the speaker. Headphones and out-loud speaker is fine.

Wife is disappointed, we'll return it once we return from vacation."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","overall good product no issues"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen producto ninguna falla ni detalle a la vista"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The product for the most part was in mint condition. Face ID won‚Äôt let me set it up but other than that the product works great! Definitely great for the price."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bien empacado, trae cargador y cable generico, esteticamente perfecto, 100% funcional, bateria al 88% muy bien para el precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It ordered two for me and my wife. I have Verizon and she has Sprint. It worked great for me but for her not so well. The first one she tried it wouldn‚Äôt activate and she took it to sprint and they flagged the phone as stolen because it had two IMEI numbers, I got it replaced through Amazon and it happened again so we had to return hers. Mine still works very well but it apparently does not work for sprint."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overall, great phone. My only issue with it is that the battery health came at 88%. Other than that, great purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","As expected, no scratches ..looks new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The quality of the phone and space at this price, was a great deal."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","85% battery health"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen equipo, protegido y serio en el env√≠o"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","so far is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Seg√∫n lo descrito, estoy contento con el producto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Impressed with the great condition and physical appearance of the cellphone. Set up easy and almost seamless. Very pleased with this acquisition."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was in great shape. It came with a screen protector on it and when I took it off, the screen did have some very small scratches but with a new screen protector on, you can‚Äôt even see them. Remember - you are buying a REFURBISHED phone like the ad says."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It takes time to get to use this iPhone compare to Android. And while learning and setting this iPhone the battery does not last more than half of the day"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Really great purchase üôåüèæ No issues so far"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was SUPER nervous purchasing the iPhone 11 Pro 512GB due to the reviews. However, I‚Äôm extremely happy I went with my gut feeling & brought it because the phone came with no scratches. It works & looks as if brand new. It‚Äôs completely unlocked (Carrier Lock: no SIMS restricted) and the battery health is at 96%. (Though once fully charge, I can go the whole day without charging it). I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life 84%.... NOT GOOD for the Price ... the iPhone it's in good shape except the battery
I brought it as a Christmas present to relatives in Brazil... I had to change the battery at Apple Store... very disappointed"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone physically wise is fantastic. No cracks. That‚Äôs where it ends. The speakers are terrible quality. The phone screen was good but internally was botched. Had to pay $140 to get it fixed not even 24 hours in owning it. I ordered 2. Haven‚Äôt opened other but I will be hoping it isn‚Äôt the same deal. Just got a call, the audio is actually SUPER terrible and will have to be replaced. Will have to see if other phone I got is as terrible or if I simply got a sour apple"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery level is at 100%, and is in mint condition, very happy. Excellent price and even better phone.
Came with charger and cable, no earpods.

Highly recommend

One thing to note; I purchase this in June (this phone was release around October) and Apple typically offers a 1 year warranty (which is transferable), which mean there should be a few months of warranty left but there isn't. Something to be aware of."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered green, I received the graphite color but I liked the color as well so I over looked that. Immediately, I noticed the speaker sounded blown out and very low. It‚Äôs only gotten worse. It sounds like my phone is under 20 blankets and coming from an Alien signal. I would return but I literally received this the day I was moving and I don‚Äôt know where I put the box. Next time I think I‚Äôll just spend the extra money at the apple store."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The Bluetooth wasn‚Äôt connecting"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone showed up quickly and is in excellent condition. Absolutely no scratches, there was some sticky residue on one edge that cleaned off easily, and it already had a screen protector (former owners gift to me). The only negative at all was that the battery Maximum Capacity is already down to 90%, but that was expected and explained in the description. I purchased the Fully Unlocked phone and it works perfectly with AT&T so far. I would highly recommend as a great alternative to buying new."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came with a great (85%) charge, it does have a minor scratch on the screen but I dont notice it nor does it interfere with anything. My phone came with a cheap screen protector on it. I did remove that and put my own privacy screen protector on it. The set up to my cell phone provider was no problem and so far I have been very very happy with my Iphone 11 Pro."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","the screen i very scratched , battery capacity was ok"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love that it came with no scratches and the cameras are flawless. The battery health came at 100% too which is awesome!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","iPhone 11 Pro
A+ Looks New. Works Perfect
No visible scratches or imperfections!
Will update accordingly if anything happens. It‚Äôs only been two days. Works flawlessly"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No scratches or defects‚Ä¶. Glad I purchased"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came in a good condition, no scratches or damages. Battery life is good so far and the phone was unlocked as indicated in purchase details."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buena la compra , era mi primera vez comprando en l√≠nea y en esta plataforma sin embargo me precio una buena compra solo que ten√≠a 84 por ciento de condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Del resto todo muy bien , el tel√©fono como tal est√° perfecto sin rayones. Me lo traje a Ecuador y funciona correcto todo, tanto SIM como el tel√©fono. Me vino una mica gratis con el cargador y el objeto de sacar el chip."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","799?! What a deal for 512gb, pro camera and a flawless phone with 100 percent battery health. I will never buy new iPhones again. I also bought a renewed MacBook Air from the same seller and it is flawless too. Never again will I buy new apple products. I returned my new iPhone 12 mini that cost 200 dollars more with no widescreen lens and terrible battery life.

Don‚Äôt think twice about renewed. Keep your money and get great tech that is indistinguishable from new."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo unico es que vino con 86% de condicion de bateria de ahi todo perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tenia mucho desgaste en la parte de atras y rayas en la c√°mara"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good phone battery life could be better I‚Äôm purchasing another phone one for my son I think this time I‚Äôll try one of Walmarts per owned phones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Its really just better than a Samsung or like android because its faster and way more sophisticated"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Littler higher on price side but well maintained. Good quality without any defects ."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought my 1st iPhone and it‚Äôs been amazing! Looks like brand new! So far, no issues! Very pleased!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Work good for few months then completely froze up"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought this product as a work phone. Outside the camera not being as I would have expected(I‚Äôm not writing a review based on that) the phone showed up with scratch marks on it which were highly visible. It had one small dent that was minuscule. The battery life from the get go was worse than my iPhone XR. Overall everything else works as expected. I feel it deserves a 3-4 star. If returning it wasn‚Äôt such a hassle I would have and spent the extra money for a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I would upload photos but I am way too lazy for that, but I would like to say the phone was in great condition. The battery health is at 97% you can't beat that! the phone works fine and I've had no complications at all."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","While there were no scratches or dings on the phone‚Äôs surface, there is definitely something wrong with the display. The colors have a bluish tone, and when turning the brightness down there are vertical lines all across the screen. That being said, 2 days in there have been no issues so far with phone functionality, battery life, camera, etc. I‚Äôm keeping it because I will probably be upgrading to the 13 anyway, but now that I‚Äôve noticed the display flaws they are really difficult to ignore. If you are visually picky, or just on your phone a lot, I would shop somewhere else."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","WORKED PERFECTLY! 512 GB battery capacity was at 96% and there were zero scratches/cracks on the screen. Microphone worked as did bluetooth. Love it <3 now i can read fanfics without any storage or connection issues :>"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I don‚Äôt need all the latest and greatest features, so I chose iPhone 11 renewed. As good as a new one, much less expensive,"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great Phone, everything was as described. No issues at all. Very pleased with my purchase"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived pretty fast and it came with no scratches! It also came with a charger. Im really happy with this iphone. I bought it for a really good price. Oh and it also came with a screen protector already placed on the screen :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I never leave reviews, but this phone for the value was great. I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews. Yes this is a refurbished phone, but at an arms length it looks brand new. Works just like new too, so glad I took the chance and bought it. Battery was at 97% so more then enough life ! Small little scratch on the bottom of the screen, can‚Äôt even tell unless you are looking for it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Recib√≠ el producto igual a nuevo!!!!
Excelente!!!!
Recomendable 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I thought it would be bigger"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is great , i got the color silver, it works great it has no problems, the cameras work amazing the phone is in good shape. But the sides of the phone has a bit of scratches but they are not too noticeable on my phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just as described. Glad I made this purchase, pleased customer."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone was in excellent condition. First day battery overheated and has had inconsistent battery life since. Most days phone will last for whole day and a half with light usage, but if you‚Äôre using your phone significantly as I do for work then it‚Äôs less than a day for sure. Overall the product is a good, enjoy the camera quality and face recognition!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came and looked brand new. Not a mark on it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love the product only thing it‚Äôs small the only thing I dislike other than that I love it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was worried with the reviews but this phone is flawless, had it for almost a couple weeks now. Came with a screen protector already on it so that was a plus (Might not be included for all of them). Aside from the packaging, I could hardly tell it‚Äôs not brand new. Battery was at 98% efficiency. I might be a little biased since I went from the 7 to 11 pro, but this is an awesome phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very happy with my purchase. I received exactly what I ordered, an IPhone 11 Pro 64 GB in midnight green. The battery came in at 100% which was awesome! The two negatives were the screen had a few scratches, one very noticeable the others not bad. Second is the box came in slightly crushed, thankfully everything was ok. Shipping was fast and even came a day early."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Product is great. Seller BuySPRY didn't drop this item in the mail for 2 weeks. Amazon automatically sent me notifications titled 'your item may be lost'. The tracking number was created within 2 days of making the purchase, but only after I contacted the seller twice for a refund did they finally drop it off at a post office. (Yes, they sent by USPS...who still does that?)

Product is great, as advertised, refurbed and not in original box, but I didn't buy the box, I bought the phone. Its genuine, and relatively flawless. 5 stars for product. 1 star for seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works great haven‚Äôt got any issue. Definitely recommended"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Listed as expected came with one little scratch near the top of the phone other than that 90% battery life expectancy clean phone unlocked and buy a real charger don‚Äôt use the one it comes with"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Thanks for the product
Really, a good item, battery life is 99%."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Speaker not working properly unless i turn it to loud on the touch screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The condition of your phone will depend on the seller. My seller, BuySpry, provided me with a nearly mint condition device. Except for some extremely faint scratches on the edges the phone was perfect. At the time of this review the 11 pro is also a relatively new device so, most of the renewed products should be decent. The iPhone I received even had 5 months of AppleCare left.

YMMV. I was fully expecting to receive a phone with ""minimal"" defects as opposed to the near mint one I actually received. Basically, you should expect to receive a product based on the description."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone is extremely delicate. Scratches easily. Other than that it‚Äôs ok."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","You never know when you buy used what you‚Äôre going to get. However I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of iPhone I received! And you can‚Äôt beat it for the price."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love my IPhone 11 Pro"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Apple iPhone 11 Pro, 512GB, Silver - Fully Unlocked (Renewed), Final Price after discount was $899 purchased on Aug 14, 2020. I have some hesitation before buying but Now I can say that, this was the best deal I ever had. Seller shipped the item fast and I received the phone before time. This phone was in very good condition and it was like new only, No scratch or dent on the body. Box contain a compatible charger (Not original apple charger). Seller will give a proper instruction in the box if you want to return the item."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought this and it came nice! No cosmetic issues at all! No scratches, battery life was over 90 and it came with a screen protector. Everything works like it should."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just received my phone, I‚Äôm very happy. The Phone is basically new and 100% battery life. Thank you so much!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","delivered on time, phone came exactly as described, no scratches whatsoever, battery was at 97%, everything was perfect and I truly recommend, especially with the price!! will be buying renewed premium from now on!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works and looks like it's brand new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very happy with purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works perfect. Thank you..."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Exceeded all expectations, condition of device was seemingly brand new."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded.
 Great Phone. Virtually no sign of scratches or used either in the front or rear. Good as New I did not connect to any cellular network. Besides that I tested the camera and other features all working just fine. For $655 it must a good refurbished ND it was."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Device is having th problem , where it didn't pick up the calls . Product is not good."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought a renewed phone Fulfilled by Amazon, and sold by BuySpry. Received it and it looked great. Then during setup discovered the ""TruDepth Camera is deactivated."" After an hour of my own troubleshooting and an hour with Amazon/Apple tech support, I was sent to the Apple Store. There I was told this phone's history says this issue has existed since at least 4 months prior to my purchase. So this was a known issue that they sold as ""works like new"". Without the TrueDepth camera you can't use Face ID.Neither Amazon nor BuySpry was willing to replace the phone, I had to purchase a different one and request a refund for this one. Now I have to pay more for the next phone and I'm out all the time I spent trying to resolve this issue. Hopefully the next purchase goes better.The moral of the story is, read through the reviews, BuySpry appears to have a history of selling defective phones in this listing. Make sure you buy from a different seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lo traje a Ecuador, llego en un paquete que obvio no es la caja original, estuvo en √≥ptimas condiciones, lleg√≥ con protector de pantalla y un cargador.En serio les recomiendo a este vendedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","devolvi el celular porque no me servia y no me devuelven mi dinero.hice reclamo telefonico yme dijeron 14 dias y ya pasaron 15 , hoy reclame por chat y me dijeron que en 15 dias mas. nadie me dice el porque , no saben que paso y solo piden disculpas y que no pueden hacer nada.no entiendo para que ponen gente a atender reclamos si no tienen herramientas de solucion a dichos reclamos. todo lindo para recibir dinero y un desastre para solucionar un problema, no recomiendo comprar por amazon, me siento robado y estafado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A lot of small screeching.. will return."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was in pristine condition and I‚Äôm typing on it now. The battery life is great so far, it was the perfect size for me and I hope it lasts me a long time! I use straight talk and picked a Verizon chip and so far so good! Very easy to set up. Great product! Only complaint is the shipping through USPS, and would recommend another option as my phone was a little late getting here."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No scratches or flaws! Came with a screen protector installed. Battery life at 97% Came a few days sooner than expected."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I liked the fact mine as perfectly fine, no icloud lock, face id is working, no scratches not cracks on the back nor front, good speakers and mic and over all amazing. the battery life is at 86 which isnt so bad for its price but i was a bit skeptical since the reviews werent the best but its mostly based off luck i guess"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No discrepancy in description. Well packaged and very clean."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm a product design engineer as 20 years of experience. I agree with the overall quality level of the product. And I would like to recommend this choice of ‚ÄòRenewed Premium‚Äô for others."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone is in good cosmetic condition and generally works well, but the sound is AWFUL. From calls to podcasts to music to ringtones, it sounds muffled, scratchy and tinny. For calls, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on speaker or not. I thought it might have been my case covering the speaker, but have the same issue when the case is off. This is my second subpar refurbished phone purchase from Amazon (first from this seller). Lesson learned."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good product at a good cost"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Complete!! Great condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great phone. I just don‚Äôt understand why this phone came with small scratches on it. (Right where the camera is located on the front of the phone) Wanted to return it, but I need a phone for work..."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular empez√≥ funcionando bien y luego presento fallas en su funcionamiento."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo excelente con excepci√≥n de la bater√≠a, sin embargo est√° por encima del 80% tal y como establece el sitio"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Shipping was quick, no cracks or blemishes that I've noticed so far and my SIM card worked fine and transferred over with no problem. It didn't come in the original box or with original chargers, but it did have a screen protector on it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm enjoying the phone so far no problems I‚Äôll update my review if something goes wrong"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The screen came with two noticeable scratches. It was difficult to see them with the screen protector but as soon as I took off them, it was very easy to see and it is still clear when the screen is on. Very disappointed with this purchase. If you order one, please make sure to check the screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone arrived in perfect condition. However, I waited one week later to activate it only to find out that the product was defective. I called Amazon customer service whom transferred me to Apple for support. Once I talked to Apple they advised me that the product wasn't under warranty and they sent me to Apple store. When I arrived there they trouble shooted and told me the product was defective. Amazon had replaced/repaired the phone with a screen that wasn't backed by Apple which caused audio issues. Phone can only be used on speaker phone. Apple sent the phone out for repair and provided me with a loaner phone. Had to take my phone to my service provider and pay activation fee on loaner phone because it couldn't be done online since the phone was unable to receive sms notifications. Too much hassle for the money I paid to Amazon. Online nor Representative gave me the option to obtain a replacement phone for free. It's holiday season so the turn around time for repair will be longer. Item has unauthorized Apple parts causing audio issues. Took phone to Apple store for repair and it wasn't able to be fixed. Store supplied me with a certified letter from Apple explaining why"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The screen became unresponsive over the course of only 3 months and stopped working completely as of today. Before this, it was ghost tapping since I got it, but was manageable after a quick turn on and turn off. Wouldn't ever buy again."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The charging port stopped working after a few weeks had to get a wireless charger but overall everything else seems to work."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is great. I have NOT tried out camera yet ( I will add to review if I find it faulty). It came with no scratches, it looks brand new. I‚Äôm glad I took a chance after reading some of the negative views.I am beyond happy with purchase as of now.If I don‚Äôt update review means iPhone still works great .P.s I can not review facial recognition as I‚Äôm really not trusting of the intended purpose. I can vouch that the phone works great !"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","all perfect 92% battery life, just like new phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Looks brand new. No scratches and comes with screen protector"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This review is for a iphone 11 pro i purchased, after receiving it powered up and showed a battery life of 93%, i have owned the phone for a little over three months and now the battery wont fully charge and i'm getting a message to replace the battery, so i took it for a battery replacement and the Apple certified service tech said the screws are messed up and the last person who worked on it did damage to them. He also mentioned the screen would probably break if they try more to get the screws out. So be aware when purchasing an iphone from Amazon that the phone can be damaged with a bad battery. Never again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Telefone veio em perfeito estado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excellent phone! It works perfectly"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like the camera most, actually that is why I got the iPhone 11 pro. Not disappointed. I am not one to run out and upgrade every time a new phone comes out and I think iPhones are priced way to high. But I decided the camera was worth the price of a refurbished 11Pro."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","REALLY GREAT PHONE! Absolutely nothing wrong, and I‚Äôve had it for about a month now. The battery will last me all day and half of the next day, the camera is beyond incredible (all cat photos were taken with the phone), awesome gaming ability, huge storage capacity, nicely organized system, easy to understand, and a bunch of cute little features! HOWEVER, the screen is the thinnest glass I‚Äôve ever seen, and I already cracked it. But if you aren‚Äôt a clumsy buffoon like me, it‚Äôll be fine!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I do not recommend this product in 2022. Other reviewers were lucky with the battery having 90%+ health, however, in 2022 I'd assume by now most batteries are hovering in the mid-lower 80%, which is right around the suggested replacement point by Apple and will cost you an extra $70.While the promise/guarantee is 80%+, again, the replacement recommendation is at 80% by Apple so it is not saying much. If I could go back and do it again, I'd just buy new."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","At first I was suspicious of buying a renewed product, but I must say that I am impressed, my iphone 11 pro arrived as new without details, battery at 98% so far without any problem, generic charger and cable but it is not a surprise because it is published like this, I noticed that the phone was renewed because it had a little adhesive on the top of the phone, happy with the purchase from this seller BuySPRY"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone arrived in perfect condition with 90% battery life. Very happy with this."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I completely love my new phone! Works great, just like brand new! I was a hesitant to buy a phone online (my first time buying Renewed) and it works great! It did not come with the original box or the original charging cord and plug, which I‚Äôm ok with. The item came in great condition and was packaged well. Phone had no scratches and accepted my SIM! Phone works so we‚Äôll! I‚Äôm so happy with my phone! Will buy again when it‚Äôs time for me to upgrade!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ha tenido var√≠as fallas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was so scared to receive this item after reading all the reviews. But it‚Äôs literally in flawless condition AND came with a glass screen protector installed on it. The charger wasn‚Äôt an original but that doesn‚Äôt really matter. There are no scratches, dents, or anything and it looks absolutely brand new. Thank you!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","the phone had two large scratches on the screen that i can see from far out... and other mini scratches, i dont know who owned this phone before but they really didnt show it any kindness.more scratches on the frame aswell, and battery was at 78%, I thought this was a better deal, shame.. i could have brought this locally for 50 dollars less and probably have non of the scratches."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great purchase arrived 2 days earlier! The phone is unlocked in perfect condition with a 98% battery life. Sis is winning!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me Agrado que esta muy bien Cuidado a excepci√≥n del Glass tiene unas Rayas profundas del Resto Bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fast shipping for certain, the battery life was originally 91 I believe then after one update it went down 2 to 89. There was also some screen damage. A quart in. Gash in the screen I noticed when I took the screen protector. Wasn‚Äôt pleased with that cause if I‚Äôm paying high money for this the screen could have possibly been replaced beforehand. Otherwise not too noticeable if you don‚Äôt focus in on it. All in all the phone is decently good tho."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs smaller than u thoight but hey."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is my first iPhone. I switched from a pixel 3 that I felt was overpriced for what I got it for. This phone came in perfect condition, battery life was at 100% life and really like this device. It‚Äôs fast, no hesitations or odd pauses to be seen in the few days I‚Äôve had it. For a renewed device I think this is a grand slam. Won‚Äôt need to get a new phone for years now. Goodbye Android"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El aparato me llego en perfecto estado no tengo queja alguna, excelente."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","üòç"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was skeptical about the product but as soon as it got here and for about a month‚Äôs use, it‚Äôs very good for your money if you‚Äôre looking for an upgrade"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bought an 11 pro and the battery barely charges on my usb - c and dies very quickly. Bought an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition, returning and hoping the next one works and is ‚Äúcertified‚Äù to a higher standard."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought two of these phones and one works great but the other has problems with the speakers. The in call volume is horrible, you can barely hear at all despite the volume being at max. Also when you try to watch a video the speakers sound blown. I'm hoping they can just replace the phone as the price has gone up since I purchased it last week"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I paid for a renewed premium cell because battery was supposed to be at least 90%, but it is 83%. Too bad!! I live in another country, I can‚Äôt send it back because I‚Äôm not at USA anymore"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Screen and shape of the phone was great."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I'm a happy customer! I bought a phone from this seller, and the phone was the incorrect size. (My own error) but it was so easy to make the return and get a refund! Very pleased, all smiles!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love my new phone it arrived like new and in great condition. I bought it right before the iPhone 13 was released so was a little upset because I paid so much for a phone 2 generations behind but I‚Äôm happy with it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","100% battery health. Exelent!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","There were several, unacceptable problems with this Amazon renewed phone from the beginning, and now, 5 months later, those problems are even worse. I spent a lot of time making sure these problems were not issues with my settings or fixable. I even spoke to an Apple technician, and he agreed these were not things I could fix myself. The touchscreen is weak or nonexistent in particular areas of the screen. The phone only rings or gives me notifications for about half my calls and texts. The screen locks up way too often, and sometimes the speaker is staticky. I understand I bought a used phone, and I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be perfect. However, the standards advertised by Amazon Renewed were not even close to being met in this phone, and Amazon would not help me. They directed me to Apple to have it fixed at my own expense."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone came a day earlier than expected with a protective screen already on top. It comes with a charger cable and base both of which are third party items. It did not come with the adapter cable with headphones, unfortunately. The screen is also arguably third party but it comes it great condition and you can‚Äôt really beat that."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My phone screen either doesn‚Äôt work half the time, or will randomly just spazz out. This didn‚Äôt start happening until AFTER the warranty expired, Ironically enough. I messaged seller about the problem and they didn‚Äôt respond. Do not buy from this Hybrid IT."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Producto en muy buen estado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works well with Walmart Family Mobile"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Bater√≠a 97% se puede usar en Honduras"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","1,000% satisfied.Thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone didn‚Äôt work. Took it to 2 different places to get it fixed and they couldn‚Äôt fix it. Was refunded my money very fast but it‚Äôs still a hassle. It was a present for my 86 yo mother"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Screen has scratches all over and the battery life is at 87%. The seller should be honest about it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am happy with this phone no problems at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono no funciona la pantalla se cambia las aplicaciones, No me permite escribir bien y no hay como trabajar p√©sima inversi√≥n. Desde el principio estaba as√≠ fallando pens√© que mejorar√≠a pero ahora no vale en lo absoluto no puedo utilizarlo. Y nos tiene ni 3 meses ya que lo compr√© desde noviembre pero reci√©n lo pude ir a ver en febrero."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tengo un mes con el tel√©fono y todo ah ido muy bien es r√°pido, llego muy bien como nuevo sin detalles y con un protector de pantalla incluido todo funciona como si fuera un iPhone nuevo. Lo √∫nico que cambia y en la descripci√≥n te lo dicen el cargador es diferente y no incluye los aud√≠fonos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A couple days into having my iPhone 11 pro the touch screen had problems to begin with it wouldn't read what I would click on at times. Other times the screen would jump so I wanted to get refund but then it stopped so I said to myself maybe the problem just went away but THEN today 7 days into me having this phone the screen went black, I already tried a hard reset, did it a couple times in hopes but its just not working. So sad about this purchase.AND NOW IM READING THAT I WILL ONLY GET 50% OF MY MONEY BECAUSE I CANT TAKE OFF THE ICLOUD!??? IF I WASNT SOLD A PHONE THAT WENT BLACK BY THIS COMPANY NAMED CELLULAR SOURCE I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF MY ICLOUD!!!!! I SPENT $620 SO THAT MEANS I WILL ONLY GET 300 BACK WHICH IS A BIG RIPOFF"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Perfecto!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm very pleased with this phone!! It works great!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm only 3 days into using the iPhone 11pro. This is my first iPhone ever and I think I love it lol! As far as this exact device it‚Äôs flawless. It has a screen protector on it so I‚Äôm hoping that isn‚Äôt to cover up major scratches but the phone performs and looks perfect. Not a single scuff even on the bezel"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono est√° como nuevo y todo le funciona perfectamente. Lo √∫nico es la bater√≠a al 88%. Estoy muy satisfecha con la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Even though the listing gave the model number as A2160 (North America), I received model A2215 (UK/Europe). Both models are iPhone 11 Pro, but the A2215 will not work in North America due to the different cell bands. I don't know how to make sure you get an A2160 since the listing clearly states the product is an A2160. I'll be returning for a refund and looking elsewhere.The phone itself arrived early and is in great shape and I wish I could keep it, but it's a pretty expensive paperweight right now!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I didn‚Äôt use it yet because I bye it as a gift for someone so I can tell Weather if you walk in good or not"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ordered this thinking it would have some light scratches and OK battery health... Turns out, the phone was brand new. Pristine condition. 100% battery health. And I have the option to purchase an Apple Care plan within the next two months. Wow! For the price, I don't think I could have made a better purchase. Your mileage may vary, but this really worked out for me."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","BUYSPRY, ECOMMERCE,AMAZON RENEW ARE ALL SCAMS. I AM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE ITS PRICEY I BOUGHT 2 IPHONE 11Pros THE FIRST ONE COMPLETELY DIED MEANING DID NOT WORJ AT ALL DID NOT EVEN CHARGE. SENT IT BACK AND BOUGHT ANOTHER NOW HAVE SPENT $1700 I ASKED THEM TO PLEASE SEND BACK A GOOD ONE. SECOND ONE I BOUGHT WAS NOT UNLOCKED, HAD SCRATCHES AND SPEAKERS DID NOT WORK RIGHT. NOW THEY HAVE MADE ME WAIT OVER A MONTH TO RETURN MY MONEY. $1700 DOLLARS. THEY DONT RESPOND TO MESSAGES. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A NEW ONE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY. EVEN IF IT WORKS FOR THE FIRST MONTH AFTER WILL PROBABLY GO BAD AND YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH A BROKEN PHONE. I PROMISE TO GOD THIS IS THE TRUTH. WHAT A SHAME ON AMAZON BECAUSE I AM SUCH LOYAL COSTUMER AND THEY APPROVED OF THIS DEFECTIVE SELLER. HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE HORRIBLE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. STAY AWAY IT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY, TIME, & A HEADACHE."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I hated the idea of buying refurbished products but this purchase changed my mind"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very skeptical about buying a refurbished phone. But I saved about $300. It said in the description that it was guaranteed to come with 80% battery and mine came with 96% battery. I am very pleased with this purchase. It has also helped me to buy other refurbished products."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overral OK, But big scratches though the screen - Product does not look like new, as description mention."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived in less than a week, great condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works as should, and looks new."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","OK"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Paid for the premium renewal. It looked fine on the outside but inside was sus. Speakers didn't function correctly as if it was submerged in water. There was a black / gray grease along the bottons and the charging port was gunked up. I wiped it all off and started the backup process. After it was done I left it alone after noticing it was hot for half an hour but it wouldn't cool down. I shut it off and waited, same thing. I though Amazon quality stamps meant something. I returned same day, none of that gypsy BS. Get your quality control in line if you're trying to stay in this refurb business. -5/5"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo funcina excelente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love this iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good phone for the price"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was in great condition besides a single dead pixel on the screen. Other than that my wife loves the camera and is happy with the purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very fast shipping, it comes in a generic box with a generic cable and charger, no headphones, as advertised, it does come with a screen protector installed, not even one scratch and very well packed, i need some aditional info of the phone and seller answer kindly and quicly. bought it for my wife, and she's thrilled, i've tested every feature and is just like someone pick it out of its original box and place it in the one i'be got. very satisfied!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","IT was very easy to set up."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","quick shipping, seems to work fine, looks real good, set up was easy even for an old man thanks"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works great! No issues üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","They did a great job in having the phone delivered 2 days before it should‚Äôve arrived... and the refund process was simple. Even though the phone only read my SIM card for 15 minutes"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I made the return of the mobile but they never returned the money. The iPhone wasn‚Äôt as I expected and what the description said. I‚Äôm still waiting and no response from the seller. I HOPE YOU ANSWER ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, Its been 15 days and they don‚Äôt answer"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in perfect condition with a great/new USC to Lightning rapid charger. I hoped for a better batter battery life with the 11 pro, but love everything else especially that it felt like I got a brand new phone from this provider ‚ù§Ô∏è. Great value for your money!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm very happy with the product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It‚Äôs a good phone. I should have got a 11 pro max though as I like a bigger screen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buenas condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was shipped to me without a SIM Card Tray... There is just an empty hole in the side of the phone. When I called Amazon they scheduled me an appointment at the closest Apple store. They told me that I have to wait another week for them to order a SIM Card Tray and then drive back and pay for it when it...

This is unbelievably inappropriate for a 3rd party company to sell a phone that is missing essential hardware for its function.

The Business Card for Warranty Information by the company Stone Group USA has an email listed that comes back as undeliverable when you email and a phone number that doesn't exist."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cuando el equipo inicia, muestra una leyenda de que la pantalla no es original, pero luego de unas horas el t√°ctil se vuelve loco, es imposible usarlo, es una lastima que indiquen que inspecci√≥nan a cuidado los equipos y al final vienen defectuosos.

Vendedor respondi√≥ r√°pido y recomend√≥ devolver el producto para reembolso."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought this phone as a gift for my brother who lives in a different country. It arrived as promised, like a new phone, no scratches, works like new, and unlocked. Very good value. Thank you very much."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone I received had a broken/damaged speaker that made it so I could only do phone calls via Bluetooth. This ended up creating issues at work. Was unable to return phone as I could not be without a phone for work or afford to purchase a new one before a refund was issued. Unfortunate situation, wish the seller would have done their due diligence before sending out my phone, now I‚Äôm out $400+."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It was well pack in excellent condition ready to use outstanding seller"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just received Iphone 11 pro 64 gb variant and the phone was in amazing condition, it had no scratch or any defect. However I'm really disappointed with the device warranty. Serial number showing warranty expired however there must have been 1 year warranty from apple with it. Tried contacting customer service of amazon and apple but still no luck."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cosmetically the device looks brand new, no scratches, dings or dents anywhere. It also came with a screen protector installed. Operationally, the device performs like it‚Äôs just out of the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase and the seller. I purchased two already and now I am about to purchase another this week."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","very good!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I expected slightly lower battery life (this one came at 86%) so happy with refurbished 11 pro w/ AT&T carrier. Some tiny scratches at the top of the phone and came with a tempered glass screen protector. Overall no complaints a few days in."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I loved how new it look and clean its the best decision I could ever make"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased this ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù like new refurbished iPhone and the screen came with scratches along the edges. It was supposed to have no visible scratches from arms length which was not the case. I had to use it for work otherwise I would‚Äôve returned but couldn‚Äôt afford another inconvenience after already having it arrive with the scratches.
Would‚Äôve liked a refund to make up for the difference in the advertised condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like the size fits in any pockets"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone did have a charging issue no problem right purchased and sold by Amazon wrong still waiting on refund never had this problem before I don't know why I probably would purchase a cell phone locally next time I'm still waiting for a refund?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This was smaller than I thought, I didn‚Äôt realize that there are two iPhone 11 sizes and this was the small one. Over priced for what it is. They said it would be delivered a week before it was actually delivered."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","it's said that This product is eligible for a replacement or refund within 90-day of receipt if it does not work as expected. but it's not true I returned the phone because of the battery life but they didn't accept to replace it"

Pero de ah√≠ en excelente estado ü•∞"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Producto en muy buenas condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was impressed with the reduced price but had some reservations about the phone marketed as renewed. I honestly thought it might come with some scratches or other minor damage. However it was in pristine condition and I am quite happy with the way it turned out. I love the midnight green color and, of course, the features of iOS 13 and the remarkable camera. I would buy this again."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Been trying a week to start the ""renewed""phone. Downloaded update and installed updated operation system but still won't pass the initial setting steps. Just goes back to the initial ""hello"" screen.
Will try to get refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Producto en excelentes condiciones, sin rayones, bater√≠a 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This product was amazing! It literally looks new and the battery life was 100%! I have no complaints and the shipping was so rapid. It does come with a charger and cube, but they are not apple. I don‚Äôt know why there is even any negative comments because the phone I got looks perfect. I definitely recommend buying this iPhone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The product works well and the seller is awesome. Please avail more products to my area."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like alot"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It has a crack screened"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am so pleased with my phone! Got the one I ordered. It was in excellent condition - like new. I‚Äôve purchased phones through amazon before (don‚Äôt think it was this co.) but I never received a special tool to remove the SIM card with before. Nice touch. Came with a charging cord. Very satisfied with my purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like my IPhone 11 Pro"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Nice deal, couldn't wait to receive it!!!!."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is like new...glistening without a scratch on it. I bought the gold one, which is more like rose gold, and it's gorgeous."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I'm still learning this phone, but so far I love it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This company sold me a blacklisted phone, basically where i can‚Äôt used this device unless of wifi because it was stolen & the person got the phone unlocked and sold on amazon, I have contacted amazon customer service and also been back and forth out of MetroPcs and amazon haven‚Äôt helped me one bit , phone works good but won‚Äôt let me use my service for my phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life 96% Face ID work perfectly 512gb now that‚Äôs a win for me it was worth it ."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had read the the reviews to this and had expectations but i‚Äôve been filled with nothing but trouble. came in clean and nice, great camera quality and nice and fresh, didn‚Äôt come with original charger but that‚Äôs ok. everything worked fine till it came to the issue of service. I bought my phone unlocked but when i had put my sim card it appeared as ‚Äúsearching‚Äù for an extensive amount of time then later appeared as ‚Äúno service‚Äù just as the image ive kinked gotten from the web.

i called my service provider, was on calls for hours, spent money for 2 new sims, and even $40 addition for checkup at best buy but yet no results and waste of money. good item i guess but i guess i wasn‚Äôt lucky as because without service the phone is useless"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buen producto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came with 100% battery life

very little scratches but you cant even notice it b/c it's so small.

battery came 100%

The only thing i had a problem with was the wire it came with, It didn't work at all."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo funciona muy bien y est√° en excelente estado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I really love the phone but there is a freaking scratch on this phone and I just paid 700 dollars for it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had to leave a review after reading all the other. I place my order before reading I was really scared from the reviews I did read. But I must say it came on time looks like new was able to activated threw metro with no problems. Love the new phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just got the phone a day early, pretty satisfied, had some huge scratches however w a nice screen protector they‚Äôre barely noticeable. All in all satisfied"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Screen stopped working the first day‚Ä¶ I had a cheap case on it until I could get something nicer, and on the first day when I returned home from work it fell out of my pocket onto the hardwood floor‚Ä¶ this kinda seems like my fault, but the screen didn‚Äôt shatter it just wouldn‚Äôt work (really colorful screen with no picture) so it‚Äôs almost as if there was a cheap off brand screen put on it. Maybe it really is just my fault because it fell, but I‚Äôve never had an iPhone break from such a minuscule impact so something seems off. Anyways, now I‚Äôm down the price of the phone + the price of a new screen and I‚Äôm not exactly thrilled with that."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have this a 2 because in theory it would have been perfect. It shipped quickly with everything included and the setup should have been so easy.

But this phone IS NOT unlocked for Sprint/T-Mobile. It‚Äôs very disappointing that it is marketed as unlocked and even lists Sprint/T-Mobile as carriers. But it is not actually unlocked and will not work. Luckily amazon has an easy return policy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone came with a1 inch hairline crack towards the top. Other than that... the phone works... battery life a little less than expected.... but then again it's a renewed phone... not New.... so they're are things that I compromised on. It will serve it's purpose.... Just keep your charger handy on those long workdays...."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Had a mixup in receiving another device I hadn‚Äôt ordered. Customer service sprang into action in making everything right. I received my correct model phone, with great battery life. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell this was a renewed device. The quality is out of the box. Thank you HQTronic!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works great! Sometimes Wi-Fi GO! In and out. Not sure if it‚Äôs my connection or the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great deal for phone that had a 99% battery life still no issues as of right now. No scratches on the back or the front and every feature works. I‚Äôve had iPhones forever and this is again a great buy from a company I have used for the first time"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love the phone but unfortunately I wanted iPhone 11 Pro Max and I thought I selected that but they sent iPhone 11 Pro"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came literally like brand new! It‚Äôs hard to even think that this was refurbished! I was a little skeptical and worried at first buying a refurbished phone on amazon after reading all the other reviews. This really exceeded my expectations; came 3 days early, and came with a hard screen protector already on. Great experience and if I needed to; I would buy from here again!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Yego en excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good shape works great battery at 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","battery life was 86%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Above the expectation when received. High quality of battery."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone had many scrapes and scratches around the edges and on the screen. Which was expected. Battery life was at about 80% which isn‚Äôt awful. Volume on phone is also terrible I can barely hear people when I answer my phone and have to put them on speakerphone to talk and speakerphone is very quiet as well. I spent $600 on this phone so I wouldn‚Äôt have to purchase another one soon but I‚Äôm definitely going to be getting another one to replace this one I need to be able to hear when I answer the phone. I always buy my phones refurbished this one seems to have the most damage out of all the phones I‚Äôve bought in the past which was disappointing since it was the newest one I have bought."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received the phone but couldn‚Äôt activate it. Apple support confirmed that the phone had been reported stolen by AT&T therefore can‚Äôt be unlocked.

I returned the phone but the seller is refusing to refund my money."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Looks new. Worth the money."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","After seen mixed reviews about the product I decided to give a try, as mentioned by others it does not come with original charger and cable. This phone looks like new but after using for about 3 weeks it started having problems, it would freeze and show pink pigments and restart, it happened around 4 times, specifically while watching videos. The seller was nice and accepted a return for refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excellent condition great quality product and fast shipping."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","First the good- the phone looked brand new except for the packaging.Now the bad- it was not able to be activated. My carrier informed me that the phone was ether not actually unlocked or, had been reported stolen.I returned the phone without a problem amd a refund was issued."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived late and when I got it set up I kept getting a message saying the display was not a genuine apple part. I paid extra for it the be in excellent condition and it didn‚Äôt have genuine apple parts. Battery life was 83%. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend, item not as advertised. Not worth the hassle. Ended up getting a refurbished I I phone for the Apple Store. All genuine parts, no problems and better battery life."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The first one was great so I bought a second one and this is it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone came spotless and came with OEM apple 5Watt Brick and cable. Everything is smooth and no issue except it came with 100% then dropped 5% battery health since I received it on December 10th. At the time I write this it‚Äôs at 95% hopefully no more drastic drops from here."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Downgraded our payout from $120 to $61 said the screen was cracked. It wasn‚Äôt when we sent it. They didn‚Äôt include a picture. Just paid half of what we expected.I wonder how many others had the same issue."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ok so I haven‚Äôt used an apple product since I was like 17/18 years old I‚Äôm now 27 and I‚Äôm not super disappointed with the phone itself just the apple store compared to the google play store"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery capacity less than 75%. Bottom speakers not even working at all. The Sound is horrible on the handset."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ve been wary and skeptical, because of the reviews and I ve never purchased a renewed smartphone. Since Amazon offers a friendly return policy, I decided to give a shot. Iphone 11 pro 65gb is lookin all good! Battery is 100% cap, not even a hairlike scratch or dent anywhere on my device. Must be my lucky day!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was for my dad and the phone came in really good condition. It came with a screen protector, battery health of 97%, no dents or scratches. The phone works great and so far he has had no issues."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I haven‚Äôt even had this phone a year and it will not turn on at all. I took it in to be repaired and they said it would cost $500, which im obviously not going to pay. So now I don‚Äôt have a phone and im out all the money I spent on it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto es como nuevo. Solo que no viene en caja original ni trae los audifonos ni el cargador original. De resto funciona excelente."

So I got the battery immediatly replaced for $69 at Apple store and the phone perfomance now is like new! Cosmetic condition was very good with few scratches on the screen but nothing serious and you would not notice it with screen protector."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Looks like brand new. Battery was over 90%. Very very please."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","when i got my new phone the screen had a bunch of hairline cracks. coming from the edges inward at they were very small and gradually grew some go all the way across the screen. i wouldn‚Äôt buy from this seller again. just because i would have to go without me phone for as long s it took them to fix it and send it back and i can‚Äôt be without my phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It every thing that you see it a bit small then I thought but that my folt but it worth ever penny I would buy it again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Vino sin un ray√≥n parec√≠a nuevo, la bater√≠a me vino con 96% de uso pero me dura un d√≠a y con uso intenso, especialmente de redes porque es parte de mi trabajo y el manejo de correo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was a gift and they love it so I bought another"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got this a few months ago and it has worked out great and I save a couple hundred dollars."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just like others, I was very concerned about buying such an expensive product as ""renewed"", but I would consider this as one of my best purchases on Amazon. The phone looks and works like new. My son is very happy. Thank you Amazon for making this one a stressful Christmas!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything is just expected except minor to small scratches on the screen"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Guess I‚Äôll try again for an iPhone that was really refurbished. The last one from Amazon was perfect. This one had an old battery. Chose the 11pro specifically for improved battery life over the X, but I‚Äôm not going to accept a battery on its way out!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I loved everything. It was in really good condition. The problem was it did not take any SIM card. I was gonna spend more money fixing it with a 50/50 chance. So I returned it. But if it worked I would have said it was awesome!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good size phone, heavier than other iphones, not too many Cover choices but excellent phone, im very happy with it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought this iPhone 11 pro 4 months ago and it came like new. Still no issue, so I'm pretty happy with the purchase.Update 2022: I recently removed the screen protector that came already on the iPhone and I found some scratches on the top."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this renewed IPhone in March 2022. In September, it began to not hold a charge. Upon, further investigation the Apple battery was replaced with a generic product, prior to my purchasing. Since, it is not an Apple battery, I can get no assistance with this product. I took a chance and definitely got burned!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is very good however the delivery really let it down"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","She loves her gift!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Water damaged. speaker not clear."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So I purchased this for my wife in hopes to replace her current phone 10. I was expecting a renewed phone but instead it seems like I may have gotten a renewed used phone because there are tons of scratches on the screen upon opening the phone from the box. The phone has been functional so far so I that‚Äôs great, but the screen is cuffed in multiple locations and that‚Äôs a bit upsetting. Will update soon."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo vino con salud de bater√≠a de 96%, con golpes evidentes en sus esquinas y parte frontal, no funcionan bien los parlantes, ni el auricular ni el altavoz. He comprado varios productos en Amazon pero jam√°s hab√≠a recibido alg√∫n producto en tan mal estado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No visible scratches. Like the Face ID. Phone is an aller than my 7Plus, but same screen size. Looking forward to trying the camera, which is main reason I wanted to upgrade. Pleased with purchase, have been waiting to get it since it came out. Great price and will get $125 for my old iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Speaker on the phone sound like it is broken and has very bad qauality. Can't hear phone calls or music properly.Otherwise a good product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The order came in a plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap like once and a brown box. The charger that came with it also didn‚Äôt work and also the battery goes so quickly. But everything works perfectly and they did give a screen protector on the phone already which is thoughtful"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So far so good!! I would go for this iPhone I trust the reviews a little bit more. Still be cautious. I was still with an Android so I didn't have a SIM card, I just went to Metro and got me sim card from their."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Its worth to have the renewed iphone with good quality and packaging."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ordered the 11pro Amazon preferred and received the phone and bright to my carrier (Sprint). The phone can‚Äôt be hooked to their network, so it‚Äôs not Unlocked. Called Amazon, got the runaround. They finally decided to replace with a different phone. 2 days late for delivery, at least I got a replacement, at least I have it, right? Wrong‚Ä¶.another trip to the carrier. Guess what? Won‚Äôt hook to the network. Again, Amazon advertised that it would work for sprint. So now I have 4.5 hours of my time at my carrier and multiple phone Calls, approximately 3 hours, and still no phone. This was an extra bad experience with Amazon with a side of wasted time. Save yourself the aggravation and look elsewhere. With all of this said, I‚Äôve been a Prime member for 14 years or so and this experience has me seriously questioning my renewal with Amazon. Good luck."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono est√° como nuevo ligeros detalles"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","took 5 weeks to get my money back after returning the product that didnt work"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","maximum battery capacity is 77% , everything seems fine you can just tell the phone has some wear. no cosmetic damage. very overpriced for a used phone in my opinion, also seller only offered me a $20 refund even though i purchased the phone 2/26 and the date is now 3/13."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I wanted a better camera and this phone has delivered! I also like the new features and longer battery life."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","My new cellphone is wonderful. I have no issues with the iPhone it's in good shape and I'm super happy. I talked to the manager over the company and he got me together I highly recommend them :) THANK SO MUCH."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Needed a new iPhone with more storage but because the new iPhone comes out next month, my phone carrier is only offering the 64gb with all models. Decided to grab this one and so far I‚Äôm absolutely amazed at the quality. Did come with an off label charger and plug but that‚Äôs totally ok, phone works perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was worried about buying this for how cheap it was compared to other places, but it arrived almost brand new (with the exception of the charger which was fine..) Definitely worth buying instead of investing $1500.00 on a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono tiene rayones en la pantalla visibles a m√°s de 60 cent√≠metros, tiene rayones grandes al costado, en la base, en todo el marco y en la bandeja del chip. Vino con el auricular sucio con polvo y con rayones en los lentes de la c√°mara de fotos y adem√°s la bater√≠a tiene una autonom√≠a del 57%.Una compra completamente in√∫til. Una estafa."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone cosmetically was horrible, it was all scratched up and hidden with tempered glass.. so I don‚Äôt think it was worth what I paid however it worked just fine, decided to just keep it because it‚Äôs troublesome returning and paying for shipping all over again so purchase at your own risk."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Straight forward, overall great phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The charger they provided (a third party cord/block) for this iPhone 11 Pro does not work, nor does any other third party charger. I tried multiple charger on multiple blocks in multiple outlets. The only charger I own that works is a very old frayed/taped authentic iPhone cord. I don‚Äôt know if this is just how apple operates with the newer model phones or if this phone is defective and needs to be returned. I Messaged the seller and I‚Äôm waiting to see what they say.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Awesome , it‚Äôs almost brand new, with 512 storage, its e very good phone, for $900 it‚Äôs worth it, better then you go in Apple store and pay $300-$400 more for the same quality. I will keep updating if something changes. Thank you seller ü§ù"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life mainly, and as a second tool, I have two phones, the other one is a iPhone X, I get stunned by the camera and how the back looks, every time I use it, the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely it for 2020"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great buy! My daughter absolutely loved it. Well package so when it arrived there was no scratches, broken screens ect. (yes I have received that from other companies). Her Sim card from her other phone was easy to install and everything was up and running right away. Great deal and we'll worth the cost."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pleased with this phone so far, it was shipped quickly and described accurately in the listing"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the phone was that it was very small for its price which I really can‚Äôt say is amazons fault but everything else is in great condition so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ordered mine from the seller BuySPRY -

The first phone arrived with minor visible scratches along the rail - nothing I couldn't live with.
But once in, it said ""Non-genuine Apple Display"" (see pic). Secondly the battery was almost degraded at 80%. Returned it for a replacement.

The replacement arrived in even worse condition.
1. The main camera lens was scratched (see pic)
2. The screen had a tempered glass screen protector - to hide the fact that the screen underneath was indeed cracked (see pic)
3. The front speaker was crackling - so it was definitely blown.
4. The battery came at 83%

This is really poor from Amazon Renewed. These products aren't even checked before sending off.

Do yourself a favour and pay more for an Apple certified refurbished product instead."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love this phone. It completely feels like brand new, I never would know it was refurbished. I love the gray color, I love the size, I love the camera and the battery life is great too."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","If y‚Äôall looking to get a look like new phone. This isn‚Äôt the way to go. The one they gave me has scratches along the side and the top of the phone. It‚Äôs def not a look like new phone. The screen and the back look fine, but when looking along the edges and the camera there are hella scratches. If your not trying to save money just get a new phone, it‚Äôs much more worth it. This purchase I would say is not worth $750 for all of its imperfections especially when the description says ‚Äúminor to no scratches‚Äù. These scratches are not minor and I am dissatisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone comes without any presentation I thought I would receive a refurbished phone but with the real conditions the charger does not work or is compatible with the phone since the cell phone itself indicates it. The charger is not original"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is a used iPhone
in the description it does not say that it is used and this phone is not new because it did not come in its original box"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not satisfied with iPhone 11 Pro has problem battery I send back them they will pay me refund"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Arrived really fast. came with third party charger and cable, understandable. Well packaged with screen protector. Almost brand new and everything works as it should. I would highly recommend so far.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","If you are looking for an iPhone I wouldn‚Äôt purchase with this company BUYSPRY. I received the phone via mail NOT properly boxed instead the phone was placed in a standard USPS shipping BAG. As you can image the phone was not properly working. I opened my camera app and the phone vibrated uncontrollably and make a loud electric noise. Of course I returned the phone ASAP and requested a refund. Fast forward BUYSRY had received the phone and never refunded me so I reached out after a few days. Only then was I made aware something needed to be done on my end. It took BUYSRY almost an entire week to refund me. SMH!"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","As an iPhone user my expectations have been set pretty high and unfortunately they have not been met with this ""renewed"" premium iPhone 11 Pro as the phone has a tendency to freeze and process very slowly at times. Physicaly the phone was sent to me in 8/10 condition which is fine.

Unfortunately, I have no options except to return it. I'll give the renewed sector another chance but will definitely temper my expectations."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I spent around $570 (including tax),I had problems also from my previous purchase iPhone 11 from your shop ,the problem is back camera (back camera was noisy n shacking to take pictures or videos), a bought a back camera part from eBuy around $40."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Had to return this phone back to the seller because of a damaged LCD. You won't be able to return for an exchange. I placed another order again also purchased the screen protector from another seller. That phone came with original headphone and charger. So I returned everything back to the seller and completed the return.

While I got the 2nd phone, it didn't come with Apple charger. Found this phone is been used because it comes with protectors already. So I contacted the seller to ask for original charger and headphone. Here is what she emphasized in message to me --

Below is the description of the accessories included with your purchase.
""Box may be generic and accessories may not be original, but will be compatible and fully functional. No headphones included""
Please keep in mind that even when the accessories are not original they will function perfectly with the device and headsets are not included.

I should just keep that original charger based on their attitude. Think hardly before you want to save that $200 to get an iPhone 11 from this seller. They won't check the quality. You get what you paid for."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Si bien el tel√©fono no tiene golpes y lo estoy usando, el sonido no es bueno, se escucha como latoso. La bater√≠a no llega con la carga al 100, llega al 80 % y no sube mas, de hecho comienza a bajar estando enchufado. Envi√© mail desde la plataforma y nunca me contestaron. Una pena porque ya hab√≠a comprado un usado hace unos a√±os y no tuve un problema."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything about the phone was okay until I checked the battery it wasn‚Äôt 100% it was 83% which was disappointing I contacted the seller and am waiting for them to contact me back."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was skeptical when I first got this, but it felt right and indeed it had been everything I could hope for. Thankfully it was fully unlocked and the only thing that surprised me was needing a nano SIM card, otherwise five star rating."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","First time buying a renewed iPhone on Amazon. I was super worried that it wouldn‚Äôt work. But it looks just like a new one! I will keep buying electronics on Amazon!
It will be even better if they can provide original box and charger!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came a little scuffed with permanent black marks on the back. I mean it works it‚Äôs a phone but I expected better."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","His phone was not refurbished correctly. It had a screen cover that probably cost a dollar late over the top to decorate the front and make it look like it was in good condition. However after realizing that The sound was hard to hear when on the phone we discovered the cover that wasn‚Äôt even placed on correctly so it covered the earpiece. Pulled it off and discovered all the scratches at the cover was hiding. When I was first delivered it came out of the package with the waterproofing hanging out the side. This phone is not refurbish correctly but more hidden to make someone make a purchase and not know what they were getting. Don‚Äôt buy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone comes in a generic white box, generic plug and charger.
Phone looks like new, I believe screen has been replaced on both of the phones I bought as they constantly freeze and you have to wait for phone to die before touch screen works again. One phone will randomly start texting letters after a sent text BBbbBbb non stop. Its like its possessed and starts randomly jumping from open tabs. Phone is not worth the hassle, now have to shop again, wait again, and transfer again. All while hoping the phone doesn't freeze up on us. Unbelievable that this type of phone with these problems right after receiving are allowed to be sent out. Risking a review like this!!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The battery that was put into the phone was rejected by the phone! You‚Äôd think that would be checked before selling.
Also my local Verizon ran a sale for the iPhone 11 right after and I got it for $150 less. So remember to check around first."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Beautiful product - Fast smooth transfer set up from my iphone 8 plus which had been severely damaged but still able to pass it's data along. Iphone 11 Pro arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition from third party seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hi,the item didn't work as I expected.
First: it keeps on turned off by itself.
The back camera doesn't work...
I'm unsatisfied with the the product this is why i want to return it safe and sound.
Thank you so much for your understanding.
I wish good luck."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got it by time ,was nice and clean with nothing wrong well packed everything works well and the battery is awesome last long

"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is to small. Why make the 11 pro smaller than the actual 11. Just dumb! I hate this phone."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was nervous buying from an Amazon Renewed vendor, but BuySpry really came through! They sent a phone that looked practically new (with the exception of some very minor tarnishing on the aluminum surrounding the sides of the phone)! Very impressed and would absolutely recommend!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very happy with this purchase. I will be looking at other Apple products from this seller."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","This item is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone works just like new. No scratches. Great price, highly recommended. I do find it odd that the phone doesn‚Äôt charge when it‚Äôs turned off."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this iPhone as a gift for a family member who lives overseas. So once I received it, I turned it on to make sure it was working and noticed they had added a screen protector to it. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and put the phone away in a drawer. Fast forward 4 months later, I‚Äôm adding stuff to my luggage and go to set up the phone for her (I bought a case and screen protector) and as I remove the current screen protector from the phone I realized that the current screen protector was added to hide tiny cracks all over the screen. It‚Äôs hard to see from the photos but the cracks run through the entirety of the screen. It‚Äôs more infuriating because if the screen protector wasn‚Äôt there, I would‚Äôve noticed the cracks when the phone arrived. This truly seems like an intentional deceit."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The front facing camera arrived with a scratch on it.I purchased a protective case and the screen shattered on the first drop - this is clearly an Apple issue as my old Samsung was dropped hundreds of times without so much as a scratch on it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","IT WAS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE AND THE BATTERY LIFE WAS AMAZING"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is like brand new no scratches but I didn‚Äôt like Size the prize is worth it comparing to others I but next time I‚Äôll order iPhone pro max. I would highly recommend if you like the pro."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone says unlocked but its totally locked. Im returning it in the 1st day i got it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My phone came basically brand new... it already had a screen protector on it also. The best part is that it came two days earlier than it‚Äôs original delivery date. This is the best iPhone I‚Äôve purchased so far."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone came with a relatively damaged box which was initially concerning. The packaging was very cheap. I was first happy to see that the phone came with a screen protector on it but later noticed it wasn‚Äôt from good intentions. I noticed what looked like a crack so I removed the screen protector to notice the phone was very heavily scratched. Safe to say this did not look like new at all so I returned it. Another surprise upon return came as well though. You have to pay for return shipping costs. Do not purchase your better off to buy an older model from Apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Satisfied with my phone it looks brand new and it even still had the apple warranty"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Been using it for a month now and haven‚Äôt had any issues. Great upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone works pretty good , the battery life is good , it does still die a little fast , but it works and it charges good , face recognition is a bit annoying as well at times , but it works good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone is pretty clean, I can‚Äôt see any scratches or any defects.Didn't come with the original box or cable, but worth the buy.Battery 88%. Not everything is perfect."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased December 2020 and phone died January 2022. Had the 1 year and 2 weeks and it‚Äôs a brick. Didn‚Äôt drop and attached photos to show no damage etc.SELLER WILL NOT ANSWER MY MESSAGES!! Very poor customer service and do not recommend. All of my past iphones have lasted me 5 years before I upgrade. I spent over 5 hours on the phone with apple and a couple hours in person with apple tech support and essentially I have a paperweight. I‚Äôm 100% grateful for Apples customer support and working with me to fix the phone even though there is no warranty with them. This is unreal. Beware of product being ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù and actually a lemon."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this phone as a replacement, and it works great. Everything was exactly as described."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hours after activating this device it was blocked by my carrier because it had been reported stolen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo llego en super buen estado 10/10 lo uso en Per√∫ y es una maravilla"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came with both speakers blown and distorted. Beyond that, it was in impressive condition. Battery was at 84%. I ended up returning it and was a disaster. Took 2 weeks and a call to Amazon. If the return was better it would have boosted my rating."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was extremely happy with this purchase! The phone appeared to be brand new! No scratches or anything. Battery at 100% capacity. Came with a screen protector on. Also came in a generic box with generic charger as expected. 5 stars!!! Completely worth it üëçüèΩ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just a heads up"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","In great condition battery is better then my iPhone XS Max. :) it‚Äôs also came 2 day early so that was nice"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It was good no scratches and even came with a charger works good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have really no complaints. It came out almost like new the box is different but the phone is very solid"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I only bought Androids this is my first Iphone and I love it so much so thank you definitely worth it!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Do not buy it, my phone broke and I went to the Apple store to get it fix but then they couldn‚Äôt fix because it had no apple material in the phone and everything was tape down in the inside of the phone I know it sounds crazy but it true plus I bought this phone for like 850 and I only had it for 8 months so that money went down the drain, i recommend going to a apple store to buy a iPhone or going to your local service store do it the right way and don‚Äôt buy even phone on amazon"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone arrived in like-new condition and works perfectly."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","That‚Äôs good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone11 Pro that I received works exactly as stated and I am totally satisfied with my purchase. Saved a few bucks buying used and the phone was as good as new. The battery life/capacity is still at 100% as well. Great buy."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","We bought this phone for my aunt!! It worked very well!! Face ID worked! The screen was responsive!! I give this a 9 out 10!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Shipping was great, got it in good conditions. Was hella happy with already screen protector on it. Only thing I'm mad at myself is that I missed and forgot my lock code so now I'm going through hell to unlocking it again. But overall Best Buy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Una p√©sima compra no se lo recomiendo a nadie comprar este producto, me lleg√≥ con el faceid da√±ado y la c√°mara frontal de dudosa procedencia con un ray√≥n en el bot√≥n de bloqueo, el auricular frontal defectuoso y sucio adem√°s del tiempo perdido en hablar con los vendedores ni amazon me ayud√≥ les ayud√≥ a los vendedores a estafar porque les di pruebas y no hicieron nada, soy de Ecuador al parecer si eres de otro pa√≠s aprovechan y te env√≠an equipos defectuosos por que saben que se nos dificulta la opci√≥n de devoluci√≥n del producto, se excusan diciendo que son errores y que se lamentan de lo ocurrido pero ellos tienen bastante tiempo para verificar y estar seguros de lo que env√≠en y no estar mintiendo a las personas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was so afraid to purchase item due to comments I‚Äôve read but this phone is amazing. I love it and I am giving this a 5 star."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No dan detalle del tama√±o del producto. Al recibirlo est√° bien, pero es muy peque√±o."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone looked and felt fine but then I made a few calls and thats when I found out the sound was horrible, static and muffled. Wasted my time"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great refurbished iphone 11 pro! Product arrived on time in excellent condition. It surprisingly came with a screen protector attached to the phone upon arrival. No exterior damages nor hardware malfunctions. Product is exactly as advertised. Very pleased with this purchase!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overall the phone is a good working phone but sometimes it won‚Äôt get me notifications when I get messages off Instagram or some other apps even though I have all my notification settings on."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought this product twice, and at first the camera was defected but second product had defected audio, I had to put my phone my phone on speaker every time. Do not waste your time and money please. This is crap."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love the phone......I didn't like that it came in an android phone box"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Para el trabajo es perfecta"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","horrible phone do not buy from this seller, they clearly do not check or inspect the phones they are selling.paid hundreds of dollars for my iphone 11 pro but the speakers did not work. the speaker holes looked like they had glue or silicon stuck in there couldn't hear an type of audio. besides that everything else on the phone worked fine but who would ever want to pay hundreds for a phone that does not work properly. the process of returning the phone and getting my money back took about 10 days."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got this phone in May. It had a weird screen protector that was cracked and difficult to remove and now randomly just shuts off. Having hardware issues now. Contacted seller will let you all know how it goes. So far not impressed!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very hesitant to buy a phone online especially off amazon but I was not disappointed. The phone came earlier than expected and is in perfect condition and even had a screen protector on it. If you‚Äôre hesitant just do it cause yolo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Could not hear through the speakers."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Wouldn't recommend this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life was greater than 90%. Really nice.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is in excellent condition, you would not know it was refurbished. No issues at all"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I'm glad I bought my iPhone 11 Pro. Great price. I wish it to continue as wonderful as it does now. I bought it a month and a half ago."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything is great with the phone, until I saw that it came with 86% battery life.. why call it ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù when the most important thing, THE BATTERY, is old."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Vale la pena"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had to reset and unlock it with iTunes which I found silly considering it says fully unlocked in title. Working fine besides that and in good condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came in great packaging, better than I expected. Also came early!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone est√° como nuevo, fue una excelente compra, y el detector de rostro funciona muy bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm inlove with my phone it‚Äôs no scratches no glitches or anything . By far the best phone I‚Äôve ever bought"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded.
 I thought it would have something wrong with it but I was actually wrong....it‚Äôs in like new condition. Only downside was the original cords was replaced but it‚Äôs replaced with a certified fast charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro "," I thought it would have something wrong with it but I was actually wrong....it‚Äôs in like new condition. Only downside was the original cords was replaced but it‚Äôs replaced with a certified fast charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone vino con el altavoz da√±ado, hice una inversi√≥n alta para comprar el tel√©fono de buena calidad y me lleg√≥ da√±ad, soy de ecuador y volver a enviarle a US me sal√≠a m√°s caro que comprarme uno nuevo, p√©simo servicio y producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Received in the mail after a week of order date. Thought it was a refurbished or newish phone, but it only has 87% battery life for $800. Not to mention the storage space has been compromised from previous owner after adding and deleting. Trade in value for this phone is $450, so they profited $350 and did not put a new battery in it!

Now I wish I would have spent a bit more for a brand new iPhone 11 instead"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone wouldn‚Äôt even get past the start up screen. Factory reset over a dozen times and still nothing. Super disappointed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Solid phone with an excellent camera and feel."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this renewed iphone, and things were ok at first. Had a few glitches with apps randomly closing, etc. Nothing crazy. Then the phone started shutting off when I opened certain apps. Again, not a huge deal. I thought maybe I didn't have it configured correctly, as a first time iphone owner. But it kept getting worse. Now 3 months in, for 2 days it shut off EVERY time I opened an app. Now it won't turn on at all. I spoke w/ Apple, they walked me through some steps to fix it, but they aren't working. It is so corrupted that it won't update, and can't even do a factory reset/restore. It's just stuck on the black screen. Not happy with this purchase at all- a phone with this price tag should last more than 3 months."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I spend the money because I wanted their best camera. I you don't need the best then save some money and buy a plain Eleven. Nothing wrong with that camera either"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very good product just like new"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","en funcionamiento todo bien pero la c√°mara vino da√±ada y es un presupuesto alto para repararla"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I need to return it since it stopped working, tried to reach out for free shipping to return but was not able to get it. Disappointed"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just like new! No scratches or any imperfections! Great buy"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy peque√±o"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It came in perfect conditions, 100% battery life percent, not asingle scratch, totally unlocked. It is like new. Im very happy because before the purchase, I read the other people comments and I was pretty worried but my phone is totally perfect."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Worked decently for a couple of months and now the touch screen freezes all the time, the battery dies within a few hours, the text constantly switch‚Äôs to numerical and back again. Overall just a glitchy phone. Not worth it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love it it‚Äôs exactly what the description said. Very clean it looks new to me. I‚Äôm impressed. I was so impressed I bough my fianc√© one and he loves it I got the gold and he got the black."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone looks and works like new! No scratches, hardware, or software issues after 3 days"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","arrived like a new product, you can not differentiate this one from a new iphone, except the box is not original iphone box."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente producto , 97 % de bater√≠a , luce como nuevo realmente , 0 rayones , libre para Colombia üá®üá¥"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Had some battery issues"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came in as described with an already applied screen protector. No issue activating on T-mobile"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love the camera on this phone. Also the 256 gig hard drive space is wonderful as well. I feel I am gonna have this phone for a long time."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came essentially brand new. 99% battery life, everything works and functions as if it was a brand new phone. Very pleased, but this phone does not come with original box or accessories."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Best shipping and receipt timing ever. The product was easy to activate and turned out to be a great gift. Thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The product exceeded expectations. Loaded from my old phone easily once SIM card installed and was up and running perfectly in less than an hour."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Product was in perfect condition, I returned due to the I order the wrong model, but I will recommend this product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","An iPhone is an iPhone and doesn‚Äôt need a lot of reviewing. Buying a renewed one is a cost effective way to own an iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Would recommend buying ""renewed"". Says it's in grade A contrition but mine came with large scratches on front screen. Nothing wrong otherwise just false advertising and misleading seller. Would advise paying extra $150 for product straight from Apple."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was nervous to buy from this seller as I had seen some bad reviews, but my iPhone 11 came good as brand new! No scratches or anything, working perfectly! Thank you!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery health was at 95%. No scratches or dents. Definitely recommend, but results may vary."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The size speakers loud.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was exactly as described! Will definitely shop here for my next device"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very disappointed with my purchase! I knew i would get a refurbished phone so i wasn‚Äôt expecting a pristine phone, but i also didn‚Äôt expect such low quality for the $600 i spent on it! The metal surrounding the phone edges was chipped and full of scratches. I could live with that because i planned on using a case. But the big disappointment was in the huge scratches on the screen itself! It was very noticeable in every angle and lighting. I needed a phone immediately so returning it would leave me without a phone since i sold my old phone to buy this one. I ended up taking it to a phone repair shop to replace the screen since that only takes 30 minutes. I really thought i would get a better quality phone for my money."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is unlocked and in perfect conditions, it includes the new fast charging charger from apple. Not even a single scratch"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought it for my lil bro and he like it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","the volume button is sunk !!!! üòîüòîüòîüòîüòî I can only control the volume on the screen !!!!! and some scratches on the screen ....."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I'm glad I didn't spend the money on a new one. I was skeptical of the reviews but I decided to ""bite the bullet"" and just went for it. Happy to say that it worked out."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone itself was in excellent condition. The problem was this was the model for the world version, not the US version. Therefore, It would not work on my carrier."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Visible dents and dust can be seen easily. I can‚Äôt believe they chose not to clean it well before shipping."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Looks great and performance is fine. It has a little scratch at the top but nothing to worry about."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","mine came with a defective screen and Amazon didn't recognize the problem. never again buying crap from Amazon"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fully recommended, nice product and very good battery, good cosmetic grade. Definitely I will buy my next iPhone with this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Was a little skeptical by the reviews but my phone arrived in amazing condition. Just has a little crack on the back corner of the phone but for the discount I can‚Äôt be mad"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not problem yet"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great buy come with a 100 % battery health very clean I‚Äôm so happy than I buy this iPhone. Came in good package"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have had this iPhone for around 6 months and dropped it in a small amount of water (6 inches). The iPhone's screen immediately shorted out and after about 5 minutes shut off. I tried many things to dry out the phone (placing it in rice overnight) but nothing worked.
I contacted Amazon about the issue of their product not fulfilling the product description of being IP68 water proof and received an email back from a 3rd party (BuySPRY) telling me that my actions voided the warrantee.

I am wondering how me dropping my phone in less than 3 feet of water for less than 30 minutes is voiding a warrantee that claims to do just that buy claiming a IP68 water proofing rating.

This iPhone is not waterproof and they will not receive returns once you (the customer) figure this out."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought an iPhone 11 Pro, then a few later months it died. I paid $700 for the phone. I took it to a phone repair tech and the mother board went defunct, cannot be repaired. I contacted BuySPRY and they informed me that the 90 day warrant period had expired. Obviously I neglected to pay close attention to that, however who thinks their new phone will die in a few months. They had no concern about my loss, offered nothing nor any compromise of a solution. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! They sold me a bad phone. Now I‚Äôm out $700, and have to buy a new phone. I feel robbed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love my phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono internamente previera estar bien, aunque sabemos que son reconstruidos, el tel√©fono por los lados est√° rayado, vino con vidrio templado, al quit√°rselo me percat√© que la pantalla tiene unas rayas. Pudieron haberlo envido en mejores condiciones. Solo me dieron $20 por los defectos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo lo dem√°s bien solo la bocina de enfrente ten√≠a mal audio"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ con un ligero detalle en la pantalla pero ni siquiera se ve
Estoy s√∫per contenta"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Very bad"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I would return it, but l just give up and not buying again"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought two phones from this company. Both worked good for about 5 months. One day I do the newest iPhone Update and my phone is crashing every 3 minutes. I brought it to the Apple store who told me that the motherboard had a problem and the iPhone would need to be replaced. Repairing it wasn‚Äôt an option. I contacted the company and they told me they couldn‚Äôt help me at all with the product. I bought it from them with a bad motherboard and find out once it‚Äôs too late for the return by date. The warranty is also no good because it expired before the company was even built. The least they could do is charge me to fix it. But no they provided no help what so ever. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It will simply be broken after the return by date just like mine."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller :) 100% satisfied"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came with more scratches than I expected. The speaker is fuzzy, I can‚Äôt hear the caller clearly & it sound mumbling. I requested an exchange. They keep pushing the delivery date ‚Äú Your new estimated delivery date is: 04/27/2022‚Äù and after 2 weeks they ended up canceling the exchange. I tried again for exchange for 2 nd time and I am going through the same thing again. I will never buy from this company again."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iphone no es nuevo, tiene muchas marcas de uso, funcional. est√©ticamente no me gusto especialmente la pantalla y los filos del dispositivo."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","battery's condition says 84% but it does not last half a day, the touchscreen doesn't work properly ir seems they have changed it. The maximum of volume is not that much and people say they don't hear me at phone calls.
I woud have returned it if I had how, unfortunately I live in Argentina and this was something they brought to me on a trip."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life was not what I was expecting. Almost touching its bottom limit with a poor 80%.
All other aspects were working good."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy funcional en USA y en Ecuador completamente desbloqueado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôm so disappointed with this purchase. I was hoping this would work, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work as expected. Also, returning and getting a refund is so much bigger a process than just sending back and getting a refund. I shipped this as requested through UPS a week ago and I am still awaiting a refund. Awaiting a refund of almost $500 is not fun for the budget."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","mine came with a screen protector and BARLEY any scratches"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life is at 84% but still holds a full days worth of charge"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love my new phone! Everything has been working great!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased this phone from BuySpry in October and found out in December that the microphone was defective and that the phone would only work for calls if I used my headphones. In December, I let their customer service team know and they said they would be able to help as long as I had Apple diagnose it. I told them that lockdown had shutdown the shops and they said it would be fine. After a couple weeks, I was able to get to an Apple store that opened and had them put together a repair quote. I sent it to BuySpry and they blew me off and said they would not honor it. This company sucks - you're better off buying directly from Apple. They have plenty of refurbished iPhones so you don't have to deal with these shady people."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The battery life is great, lasts an whole day without having to charge it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love it, the only weird thing is it came with a screen protector already on the phone that‚Äôs a little bit off center."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I tried for hours to get the phone to update the software during the initial set up and transfer of data. It was unable to update the software after trying for over 4 hours. I took it to a professional who could not get it to work either. I was unable to transfer my data to the phone, or even make it to the home screen. Not as advertised."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I love it no problems works great"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great quality product. Scratches to the side but still amazing"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone was clean honestly it works like it‚Äôs brand new! Perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got the phone, noticed right away it was preused, the top camera lens had a crack and the apple logo had a noticeable scratch on it. Screen seems hard to tap sometimes, borderline unresponsive. Also see the top half of the screen flickering for a few seconds for no reason. Coming from android, not too inpressed with the ‚Äúapple quality‚Äù everyone I know has been boasting of. Bummer!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone freezes from time to time."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Went from an I7 to this. Like going from a 1963 VW to a 2020 Caddy."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Great product! Like new! Just perfect, so pleased with my purchase. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","this was a very good value and even came with a screen proctor pre-installed"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ven√≠a con una cuenta de otra persona y fue un desmadre para poder activarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I bought the cell phone as a Christmas present for my sister. I'm very disappointed. The cell phone started to give a lot of problems between them, the device started to heat up, burning my sister's hand and turning it off by itself, thus disappearing the information. Look for support with the seller and he told me he couldn't do anything. I was supposed to contact amazon. I do not advise anyone to buy these devices and neither does the seller. I will never buy anything like this again. For me it was a lesson."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","At first I was nervous about this purchase but after receiving and activating my phone M worries were put to rest . I love this one thank you so much"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Wasn‚Äôt completely unlocked. Only compatible with AT&T."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It never works for my password and stuff that I have on my phone I have to key everything in to get into my apps. This phone has been nothing but a headache. Some days I can‚Äôt even get a good call. It‚Äôs always dropping calls or they breaking up so bad that they can‚Äôt hear me I have to hang up. For this phone to be 550 plus I should not have the problems that I have with this phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Vida √∫til de bater√≠a 80"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Doesn‚Äôt hold charge"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I don‚Äôt understand why you not sent to me headphones?Phone work but I need headphones!!!And charger is not apple charger"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","iPhone 11 exceed my expectations the phone looked brand new with no blemishes and all the functions work perfectlyI will definitely recommend this vendor quick delivery and great product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pienso que por el costo debi√≥ ser un tel√©fono en excelentes condiciones me siento defraudado con esta compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got the iphone, everything seemed ok, but the charging port was broken. I could only charge it via wireless charger.... Since it arrived fully charged, it is hard for me to think that the provider wasn't aware of this malfunction.They sent it to me like this intentionally. And still haven't got my money back.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","If I could give this iphone a zero rating that is what it would receive. The original seller was buyspry. The phone arrived in a non apple box, screen covering seemed moist, side of the phone was dirty, and scratches everywhere at $535. I didn't cut the phone on to see how it worked because the outer appearance was enough for me. The charger is so bootleg it was a absolute terrible purchase. I would not recommend. Immediately requested refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tel√©fono en p√©simas condiciones deficiente de bater√≠a y detalles por todos lados"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came as advertised without any scratches or damages."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Nice phone looks like new , battery also 96..Nice seller . Highly recommend , thanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very excited to get this phone for my wife for Christmas, but it's been a total waste of money. It's had major issues restarting constantly after three months, but it seemed to fix itself and was alright for the next few months. However, just a few days ago it started having the same issues again. We took it to an Apple store today to hopefully just get it taken care of, but they claim it's a hardware issue and due to it being refurbished, they won't touch the device. So now I've got a nice $850 paperweight. Will not be purchasing from this company again."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Everything works great especially the facial recognition, i just don‚Äôt like because its was smaller than expected,"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Unable to activate if your phone carrier won‚Äôt take a refurbished phone!! Unable to get a refund as they‚Äôll only refund the card purchased with. Sadly the card used was a legitimate gov‚Äôt issued SSI card. (My disabled sister needed a new phone and this was her phone of choice) and now she‚Äôs out almost $1000.00 and they cannot refund the card for legal reasons BUT are unwilling to grant her a refund any other way!! And still has no phone as it was sent back when we asked for the refund. Why can‚Äôt they just send her a new phone vs a refurbished one? Especially since they refuse to refund by just sending her a check. All we really want is the phone! Do your research prior to purchase!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iphone 11 pro was great for a couple of weeks then something happened and it won‚Äôt run internet through my cell service only WiFi.It was working fine then it quitNow I have to take it to Apple and pay more money to fix it after I paid almost 900 dollars for itUpdate: the phone was fine it was in the carrier's end they reset it and it works great"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is the first item I‚Äôve gotten from Amazon and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. The screen is loose at the top and when I press something it just goes crazy. It starts opening and closing apps while flashing really fast. I DON‚ÄôT LIKE IT AT ALL!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","me llego el produecto en buen estado tal cual como lo describen , recomendado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Exactly as described, everything worked as new, overall we are very happy!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I paid for a broken camera"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received my phone at the end of July, and so far, it‚Äôs operating no different than a brand new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","First off mine came with a couple of scratches on the screen but they aren‚Äôt really noticeable while on. It also came with a screen protector already on."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Nice and comfortable"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It is a good phone but the audio is pretty bad. very low. bad quality and even when you put to record those 3-4 second doesn't even record the audio. in general looks like a fake phone not a real apple phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not a single scratch. Phone is pristine. It came with a MFi brick and cable."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Purchased this product only to find out when trying to change providers that the phone had a balance left on it from another purchaser. Consequently until the balance was paid the other person was considered the owner. Obviously I paid the balance in full but can do nothing with the phone. Plus Amazon is not assuming responsibility or at this out point even assuming any responsibility. I in the other hand am out over $1000.00. Which no assistance in store. Pretty risky to purchase a phone thru Amazon. Be very careful you may end up like me!!!! Just to let you know this was an IPhone 11 pro. The company Amazon subbed is not willing to refund it or exchange it. I will never buy anything again without knowing where it comes from."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","DO NOT BUY!! I regret buying this phone for this price. This phone shuts off or restarts itself about 2-4 times a day. The charger it came with sucks really bad!!!! I would return it but I had already paid to activate it. The phone itself does look nice and camera works great but this is the last time I buy a phone online."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I just tried to activate this phone with my carrier but after giving them the IMEI number, they said the phone has an ""apple carrier lock"" on it. VERY unsatisfied with this seller."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fair price, fast delivery. Condition was excellent as was the battery life."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Esta muy suave y padre lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good for money"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone arrived fast, and was like new. The performance is excellent, beats all expectations."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Got one with a screen protector installed. Pulled it off and saw one of the most scratched phones I've ever layed eyes on. Forget arms length, those canyons could be seen from across the room. The glue in the protector just helps hide them a little.If that protector lasted 90 days, I'd be paying $300 to get a replacement.Adding insult to injury, now I've got to pay a bunch of money to return the phone to the scammers where I'm confident it'll just be pawned off on another unsuspecting victim.As Amazon certified them, I hold Amazon responsible as well.What a waste of time and money. Never again."

This is a total scam, and for send the phone back I need to pay $150 more, my worst experience buying on Amazon even though I always bought refurbished phones on Amazon like a iPhone X and a 7 plus, they were in perfect state, not like this crap of iphone 11 pro.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","This company likes to charge $1000 for a phone that they refurbished but somehow don't care to replace the screen on phones that have big scratches on them.If I refurbish a phone, if the phone has deep scratches I will replace the screen. Especially if I plan on charging $1000 for what amounts to a USED device. Because I'm sorry guys but refurbished doesn't mean you polished it up with some glass cleaner or maybe replaced a simcard tray. It means that you make the phone look brand new.And I guarantee you as a phone reseller all the phones I call 'refurbished' look brand new. Stay away from these sellers. They cut corners and charge outrageous prices."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I try to exercise discernment when buying products of any kind.For example, car defects out of the factory, as opposed to a potentially sneaking car salesman neglecting to tell me about the transmission slipping. You won't know until you drive it.This phone looks great, functions well but the battery has a false bottom, and probably from water damage. It dies between the 10-20% threshold. Buyer beware."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was such a disappointment.It didn‚Äôt come with the box, it came with some generic charging cable and a cheap one at that.It came with some random screen protector on it so not even how a renewed phone should look like!I bought an apple computer renewed and it came as factory but this phone I give these people a 1 out of 10‚Ä¶I was cheated out of the box, charging cable and everything else that is supposed to come with it.The pictures were misleading also‚Ä¶WOULD NOT BUY FEOM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","great phn"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone is no longer operational. The phone out of nowhere started to open up from the side and gave a very strong chemical odor. The phone now will not charge 100%. I never dropped the phone nor mishandled as you can see from the photos. The Seller is unwilling to take the return nor fix the problem stating I had a 90 window only to return the item. My suggestion is to stay away from the seller they're horrible to do business with."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the IPhone 11 Pro and it was advertised as NEW. When it arrived it had scratches on the screen and not in Apple packaging nor did it come with Apple charger. I paid more money for it supposedly being new and it was not. Very disappointed. I wouldn't complain if I knew it was a used one but the fact that I paid more money for something that its not doesn't make me very happy. If I was buying a used one I would expect the flaws, but that's not what it was advertised as."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","We purchased this phone in May and in September it stopped working. Brought into the apple store for help, and they diagnosed it for us, finding that something in the internal workings wasn't getting enough power. To fix the phone would cost more than purchasing the same phone new now, $550. Basically, with no return policy we have had the phone for 4 months and have wasted $615. An very expensive piece of trash."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just what I wanted"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","At first i was browsing to buy iphone 11 pro max and this product came to my attention. I checked all the nessary features and it was fine. Then when i put it on the cart, automatically the item was changed from i phone 11 pro max to just 11 pro.

In the $999 phone, the display has a crack across the top right corner (and numerous scratches on the display). In the $949 phone, the display was cracked all the way across from side to side, about halfway down the display. They did cover it with a screen protector to conceal the damage. But it was visible from a distance in both cases. So these phones were not ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù in any sense."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","My wife hates apple and I thought this new model would convince her. I also bought her an new model iPad. She hates them both from a uses point of view. Not an easy phone in general. Sits on the counter unused."

Very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Dura bien excelente hasta ahora va todo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone was dead on arrival and I am fighting to get the refund. Avoid buying a refurbished or renewed phone. The product may have some internal issues that look fine on the surface but will fail, but you will be out of warranty. Sometimes those phones are not actual Apple Iphones either."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","purchased this exact green 256gb phone and i read after buying that you are guaranteed a minimum of 90% battery health and i got 91% and my reason for upgrading was to escape the battery deterioration on a previous iphone 11 at 86%he who expected nothing shall not be deceived.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I got apple care when I bought my mom's phone. It covers battery runout and screen break. But I wanted to have additional warranty since my mom drops her phone like crazy. But additional apple care was so expensive that I eventually did not get it‚Ä¶ and the private insurance was not worth it I heard... make it cheaper apple!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Does the job just fine!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered this product though I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews, however, I was blown away by the perfect condition of the phone. I have now been using it for 2 months everyday and still, it works perfectly. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Unlocked with 512GB of storage and it came in about 4-5 days. It was $869 which was a great price for it. There was a screen protector installed on it but I could see a small scratch/crack at the camera notch. When I removed the screen protector I found 5 or so scratches in various places on the screen. I can't see them at all when the display is on so I don't mind them for that, but I can see the scratches turning into cracks if it were to be dropped and so they just make the display a little more delicate.One of the biggest concerns I have (I may return it because of this) is that it's not under warranty anymore and that also means it's not eligible for AppleCare, so if something happens in the future, the motherboard fails, or display fails, then any of those costs will be something I have to cover which means it's entirely possible that if one or two major things go wrong in the next couple of years, that the money I saved from buying this renewed, would just be put into paying for potential fixes. Hopefully nothing like that happens but it's important to think about.I haven't noticed any dead pixels or anything else wrong with the phone. The cameras work, the lightning port always charges, all buttons work and it's now in the Apple Battery case, which has the camera button, which is fantastic!All in all, I think it's worth buying."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","i liked it"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Don‚Äôt buy a phone from them. I got my iPhone 11 Pro Max and the phone freezes."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Having spent so much on a phone, I have some sort of regret. I wouldn't do it again that's for sure. The price has to come down in between $300 and $500 for me to know that the product was worth the price."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It's perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me agrado porque vino con protector de pantalla"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It is good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I cannot get rid of the 4 copies of contacts (over 4000 on this GD device now). I spent hours one evening cleaning them up, only to have them all reappear. Seriously?!The options are zero contacts or 4000 contacts.‚ÄúMerge‚Äù does not work.Once this phone is dead, I‚Äôll be going back to the Google phones.Terrible."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is renewed and used and costs more than a new one that I can get at apple's website or an apple store. I dont understand why, a lot of these Amazon Renewed phones are like this too. The phone is good I'm assuming, but I wouldnt buy it from here since it's about 200 dollars more expensive. What a scam this would be."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone was chipped and screen scratched. This is the first time we‚Äôve had a problem buying a refurbished iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I mostly like it it was nothing I don‚Äôt like"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Price too high as used phone. Apple store brand new phone just $1149"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I loved the customer service because even when the phones speaker went bad they were there to help me out not like other brands.. shop with them you WONT REGRET It."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Terrible experience. Seller sent iPhone with the gaskets removed. These gaskets keep moisture out of the phone, especially moisture due to humidity. After a few months of use, this phone's cameras stopped working. Local repair shop informed us about the removed gaskets. Seller said that because it was outside of the 90 day window there was nothing they could do, despite defective product."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I purchased a phone form this seller, upon arrival i discovered that the phone was indeed not unlocked"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is so so so so incredibly good for me so can I please have a nother one for my sister for free please because that would be awesome."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is bad it is glitching and color switching and it looks nice but has problems with the screen lighting or idk wat you call it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is very shiny and the most important thing is that you can serf the web and make a phone call at the same time. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hi, my name is Tania and I like your product I can give a five star rating for one of your products."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is over priced for sure. It does a lot and is quick but give me a break, Apple just charges too much for their products."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","None of these phones make sense to purchase, esp, they are renewed and price for them are higher than is being sold on Apple for the same phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","it was coooooooool"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","JH"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I made a purchase of a renewed iPhone 11 Pro, 512Gb and they sold me a stolen phone, if I buy again will you sell me a stolen device?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came, turned on and allowed me to set it up for about 20 minutes before turning off. Tried to hard reset, plug into iTunes etc... Stuck on Apple logo. Not recommended"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It was in good condition"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery drain very fast please stay away"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La vida de la bateria cual es ?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The 13 just came out. This is not worth the listed price especially with all the negative comments about poor customer service. WOW $350 and maybe then we can talk."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I recoment this seller very good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","They market this item as renewed, but in my case they simply slapped a screen protector on it. Take a look at what we received.I'm returning this for a replacement. If the next one is in the same condition, I will ask for a full refund."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good product"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It has three cameras"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lastima la caja. Y los art√≠culos originales del celular. Muy mal que no viniera completa, y el servicio de env√≠o se demoro."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","bought this based on reviews, turns out its crap, the sides are completely ruined and scratched, im leaving t go back to my country tomorrow so i cant return it, this is awful, i want a refund!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I recently noticed there are no patriot themed iPhones and now my son is throwing a tantrum thanks for ruining my wine night"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","READ THE DESCRIPTION !This comes with nothing original!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone came in poor condition, giant crack on screen...do not buy save your money"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iPhone üì± it‚Äôs totally garbageDon‚Äôt buy don‚Äôt buyThanks"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","So my experience with renewed premium has been a mixed bag. The value is pretty good , you get a year warranty on the phone which is what drew me to this program. But clearly the guarantees they give are not 100%, as i got my first iPhone with defective speakers and the second with 87% battery health. Physically, both phones were in great, nearly flawless condition which is great. Maybe the battery health of this phone was 90% when they packaged it a year or two ago and degraded, but I doubt it. A bit disappointing to be honest."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This product was brand-spanking new! So relieved and happy. I just can't bring myself to pay full price for what I really want, and this iPhone 11 Pro has me happy snappy. It said there would be minor scratches etc, not visible from arm's length, but I can't see any imperfections on this at all. Battery is great - I've done things like listen to a book for 3 hours, and at the end of the day, the battery was only 50% used. Very happy."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was needing a new phone and I found this renewed 11 Pro on Amazon. I knew it could have some flaws to the case. When it came I noticed one of the lenses was cracked. Kind of a circle crack. I waited to get it set up and take a picture to decide if I was going to keep it ior not. When I took a picture, the crack didn‚Äôt affect the quality of it at all. I was very pleased, so I decided I would be keeping it. I have since purchased a lens protector and put over the lens so it doesn‚Äôt get anymore damage."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I had purchased an XR a year ago and noted that it was just perfect. It replaced IPhone 7. Now I‚Äôm replacing another iPhone 7 for my wife. But I wanted to be farther from obsolescence so I found the 11 pro. It has worked as expected an it seems to slicker, thinner and shinier."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Just received so may update later but the phone came in physical great shape. The box included a generic cord and power box but did not include a SIM card pin like promised. The sticker over the camera left some goo that i thought for a moment was scratches, thankfully came off easily with a little cleaning. The battery health is 100%! All iPhone 11 Pros have it but the dual-SIM thing is really great (one eSIM and one physical SIM). I was upgrading from an iPhone 7, the main differences so far other than dual-SIM is the face recognition, battery health, screen size (the whole phone is a little bigger and heavier), speed of operation, and the camera of course is much nicer! So far happy with it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I liked everything about this phone. Color, battery life, face recognition, and most of all no damage. I also had no problems putting my SIM card ( cricket ) in and it working right away. The only thing I could say that was an irritation was the fact that my texts didn‚Äôt transfer. But other than that awesome product. Thank you will be from this company again. üíØ percent satisfied!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","one tiny scratch on the back... but all good. Hooked up to my carrier. amazing quality, not what the seller did, its the phone... lets be honest... Seller did have quality product and not all scratched up.... so cudos..."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","i got the green one and its more of a gray color tbh so i was a little sad abt that. theres a few scratches on the screen itself but theyre very small and it was also advertised and used so i expected it. everything works perfect no issues other than the color difference"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am still mainly using my old phone but, when I am using this one it works very well. There are a few places where there is visible damage but it is barely noticeable. Also, it came with a screen protector on it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This iPhone is in great condition, no damages or markings. I was extremely satisfied."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was very worried about ordering this phone on line but I gave it a try and no regrets. It arrived earlier then planned. And works just perfect and have no complaints. I am not phone savvy but surprisingly I was able to transfer my phone information over by my self and with in 25 min. I‚Äôm happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This ‚Äúrefurbished iPhone had to be brand new. There was not the slightest scratch anywhere on the phone front or back. The generic box had the word ‚Äúnew‚Äù on it. Battery was 92%. Quite happy am I."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love this phone! Not a mark on it, was able to transfer all my apps and data from old iphone 8+ in 10 min. Inserted SIM card and all is good ! Much better audio quality on calls, face recognition works well (unless I am wearing sunglasses or a mask)."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came in perfect condition, not a single scratch or scuff. The battery is guaranteed to be at least 90% but mine came will full 100%. All of the functions seem to work so far. Would definitely recommend."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I like this iPhone 12 pro. This phone works great. I recommend for others. But i am first time iPhone user. I am not interested with small screen. Charging time is almost 2 hours to get full charge. My previous phone get full charged in 15 minutes."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The equipment did not work, but they quickly accepted the return of the equipment"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This is the second phone I purchased from Amazon and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. The phone arrived quickly and in mint condition. It was gorgeous, battery life was at 100. I‚Äôll definitely continue purchasing."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I‚Äôve had a Samsung for 12 years, this is my first iPhone, still getting used to the differences. But I would say it was a good purchase."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Funciona excelente la vida √∫til ,el rendimiento muy bueno de la bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This iPhone came in excellent condition, much better than described! I couldn‚Äôt be happier!

"iPhone 11 Pro ","It came with 100% battery life which was shocking, the phone is in perfect condition with only little scratches. It came earlier than it was supposed to.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Is working well so far"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù packaging and boxing was good. But, it was a different story when I got to the phone. Someone had taken off the protective plastic film from the phone or a new plastic film to protect the phone's screen and back was never replaced in the ""renewing"" process. The result? The plastic film was beat-up and barely adhering to the phone. There was dust, finger prints and hair trapped under and on the plastic film. This phone either had a different owner between the original purchaser and me or, as I said before, they never replaced the plastic protective film when renewing. This is my first experience with a renewed product and it did not go well. This phone is going back to Amazon. I suggest that if you have any, even the slightest dissatisfaction, with any facet of this phone or any ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù item, you do not keep it and you send it back! Never again for me! I will only purchase new in the future. To avoid having a similar experience as me, you may consider doing the same."

Nothing I could do would fix it so I had to return."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I really love this iPhone. At first I was scared to purchase based on the bad reviews that I read but trust me I bought it and no regrets. The phone is next to new, my only issue was that it has a battery life of 83% but it‚Äôs renewed so that‚Äôs expected. Value for money tho."

 Whatever they did to ""renew"" this iPhone wasn't very thorough. Furthermore, they shipped this very expensive iPhone in a bubble envelope versus a padded box. The display worked initially but then started flickering and next thing I know the display died. See video I posted.

The actual listing for this 512 GB iPhone advertised in the images a 1 year warranty (and still does) but seller would not honor it. Thankfully Amazon has 30 day return policy so that was honored so I have returned the iPhone back in the bubble envelope."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Happy happy happy üòÉ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Came fast and product works great. Only a little scratch on the camera but battery life and screen are perfect ! :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It came fast and it‚Äôs in great condition! No deep scratches only micro scratches on the sides but I put a case on it and you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs a used phone at all!
I was able to update to iOS 14.6 and it‚Äôs super fast, face recognition is perfect, it‚Äôs compatible with basically any carrier.
I love it!! It was well worth the money and looks amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Honestly the box that this came in (not the amazon brown box but the iphone box inside) looked a little sketchy and I was afraid the phone wouldn't work but the phone has worked just fine so far! It had protective film over the front and back and mine even showed up with a glass screen protector already on it!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ",":)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I got it in good condition was package very good and secure I love it the same way I went I updated my new phone right away with T-Mobile was very easy the volume was perfect the shape was good I love ‚ù§Ô∏è so far so good was beautiful thank you üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","solo tard√≥ en llegar a su destino, pero no tengo quejas, es una m√°quina de celular."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","S√∫per bonito viene con su vidrio templado ninguna rasgu√±o"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I need to up grade my iPhone. I like it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Love it! It came early and it's exactly as described. It even came with a charger."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I found out the iPhone 11 I bought had been black listed that means it was either reported stolen or sold before it was paid off. It can‚Äôt get service until it is taken off the blacklist. It wasn‚Äôt a great price for a refurbished cell it‚Äôs an awful price for a blacklisted one. I hope Amazon will not let this company continue to sell stolen phones on their site. I should probably return it but I also don‚Äôt want to have to pay for a brand new phone while I wait to be reimbursed for this one. I am hoping to have it taken off the blacklist, they said I will have to wait 24 to 48 hrs. I am tired of going in to AT&T at this point."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Only issue I had was when taking pictures in lightened area the pictures comes out very poorly."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone works perfectly well! Long lasting battery life for a used phone!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El telefono viene tal como se describe y al menos en mi caso venia totalmente nuevo sin el mas minimo da√±o estetico y con el 100% de salud de la bateria"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It's really just a hit or miss. I knew purchasing a refurbished phone had its risks. I purchased mine, and I was pleasantly surprised. The phone did not come in an original box, nor did it come with original accessories, but I knew about that. The phone's condition was mint. You can't tell that it's been used, and mine came with a screen protector. Setting it up was really easy, but the main problem I had with is was the stiffness. I had a hard time opening the sim card tray, but it did end up working, and the volume down button was hard to push. Other than that, everything works fine. Battery life was 100%, unlocked, etc. So, if you're thinking about buying this, DO IT. At the end of the day, if you're unhappy with it, you can always return it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone was perfect from the first moment that I charged it and turned it on. Perfect"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es un excelente producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La bater√≠a venia con 90% de vida √∫til, pero. O importante"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Works great!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It came scratched"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Even though I bought it not new it‚Äôs working pretty ok. It‚Äôs an iPhone, which means it‚Äôs something good"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","When I first received the product, the front protective film has been attached. And I thought they were kind.
But when I turned on the flash light and inspected the product, I found the scratch. It's on the right side of the front camera.
I guess they put a film on to cover up those scratches.
I took a video and pictures of them.
And I would like seller to either replace it with a normal product or provide a quick return label."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A nice device , picture quality is great, looks great, water resistance is a plus for me.Fast processor."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","91% battery life so not to bad"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","As advertised. I bought the iPhone 11 Pro 512GB silver, unlocked. My AT&T sims card worked with this iPhone. The battery capacity came at 100%, which is like new, much better than my iPhone 6s Plus, 79%.

So far the phone works and I have no issues activating it, transferring my data from my old phone to this one, and adapting to the new updates. The sounds in calls and FT have been a little off, but hopefully it‚Äôs not the phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I don‚Äôt like having to sign in to everything again. I can never remember my password which is why I loved the fingerprint option on my last one. This one doesn‚Äôt have it. So I need to reset some passwords but this happens with every new phone so it isn‚Äôt the phone‚Äôs problem, it is mine but I do love my new phone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I'm so happy with my phone. It came in earlier than expected. Kinda upset I had asked for a silver phone and got a grey one. But it doesnt matter anymore I love my phone lol."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am totally impressed, the iPhone looks and works like new, no scratches 5‚òÜ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I am not going to review the iPhone 11 Pro...there are a ton online for you to peruse. However, this Amazon refurbished example was literally like new. Well-packaged and in a secure mailer, it fired right up. Battery indicated at more than 90% after a deep charge.

I have no idea what the refurbishment process is but, when I ran Apples Diagnostics - everything was A-OK. Not much else to say other than to buy one and save!

PS: I can't speak for those who have had problems - but, that's the beauty of purchasing through Amazon, you can always send it back."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","excelente producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Really enjoying this iPhone 11 Pro. I upgraded from an iPhone 6S, so the bar might be a little lower than for other folks, but it's a great phone so far. The screen is really crisp and full, and even though the lack of a fingerprint reader button took a little while to get used to, I've found the FaceID to be much more convenient, which even works at night and while wearing glasses or a hat. It does NOT work shen I have a dust cover strapped on my face to satisfy those who are paranoid...in those cases, the phone reverts back to requiring a hand-jam input of my passcode.

I'm not a big photography buff, but the additional cameras on the PRO version does allow for some amazing capability that I would think I would find on a nice camera, but wouldn't expect on a phone.

I have noticed some difficulty or trouble with typing texts. I am a super fast text person, but with this phone, I find myself making all kinds of spelling errors and the phone makes a lot of error-correction errors. It's has touch-slide typing ability, but I have that turned off as it made a LOT of errors with that functionality turned on.

Overall, nothing markedly bad to say about this device. I am enjoying it (except for the price...any phone that requires a small loan to purchase is concerning to me. ;-)"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","So unhappy. Got the phone within the next day of ordering so I was so excited (originally had to wait 5ish days)! The phone came with no scratches or other visual defects, PERFECT! And then the set up came. It was terrible! Took 5 hours because I had to backup my phone to my laptop, and then download that backup to this iPhone. It would not do the quick setup because this iphone has no WiFi or Bluetooth capabilities! The WiFi is greyed out and the Bluetooth is forever loading. I contacted AppleCare and of course, IT‚ÄôS A HARDWARE PROBLEM! Very unsatisfied. Does all of the other basic functions work? Sure. But my phone bill is going to be through the roof since I don‚Äôt have unlimited data. It shouldn‚Äôt have to be that way. I took a chance with amazon renewed because it says all devices passed all diagnostic tests, clearly they missed one. Never again. My seller was BuySPRY.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Update:

I am trying to find ways to fix this since returning the product would be a hassle. Tried a bunch of googled advice and it still doesn‚Äôt work. And now on the morning of Day 3, the apps aren‚Äôt loading properly and the phone doesn‚Äôt charge (I am using my own original iPhone charger) unless I turn the phone off and back on again. If it‚Äôs about the luck of the draw, I sadly drew the unlucky defective one."

I tried rebooting it and everything you can think of. Unfortunately, it has to be returned.

It came in NON original packaging with a non Apple cube and a new wire. The iPhone was clean and crisp with no physical damage to the appearance. Also had brand new clear covering to prevent fingerprints while in packaging."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone works great"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was a little bit worried since I have seen mixed reviews and it is my first-time mobile purchase on Amazon. There are so many things to write about. The most important thing is I got it in 3 days though it is a pandemic situation. I thought it wouldn't be that good. But surprisingly it is like a new phone. I was worried about battery performance. But it is great as well. NO scratch, this one had the original cable and the charger which I didn‚Äôt expect. On top of that, it came with a screen protector. Thank you so much for this wonderful product at a reasonable price!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone was amazing since i first got it. I had my doubts on Renewed phones from Amazon but I am now reassured that renewed phones are legit and would recommend buying. My iphone had very minor signs of wear, signs that you really had to inspect very closely to see. so it was a well taken care of phone, popped in a screen protector and case and it was good as new. Battery was at 85%, if you're new to iphones like i was that is still a day and a half of battery life before next charge. I used it a fair amount of time maybe 2 hours of hulu each day and checking socials here and there and it lasted perfectly. Dont shy away if you're concerned for the 80%+/- battery life it is still an excellent percentage for anything."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Reconditioned Apple 11 Pro iPhone replaces my aging Apple 8S that decreasingly handles today's technology. Looks and works great for me, at half the cost of the brand new Apple 12 now selling. Encased in the Otterbox Defender Pro to keep it very well protected against damage (like my workplace Apple 8S iPhone). My only dislike is that the reconditioned 11 Pro battery quickly drains daily, so I have to recharge it at the end of the day everyday. But that was an advertised ""at least 80%"" capacity original battery, so no surprises there. I do not need, nor use, the fingerprint reader, and the sheerness is not a consideration for me, being encased in the protective cover."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was actually very nervous to buy due to some bad reviews. But either I got really lucky, or Amazon renewed products are really decent! The screen doesn‚Äôt have one scratch. The battery health is at 93%. It‚Äôs 256 GB Just like I ordered. Everything works perfectly. But just in case it doesn‚Äôt, I bought a 2 year warranty. The phone is basically new. A lot of people with iPhones want to upgrade as soon as a new one comes out. Leaving very good and basically new phones to be sold as used. I recommend getting this if you need an upgrade. (I‚Äôm slow to upgrade phones. I‚Äôll probably keep this until the iPhone 17 comes out) so far so good! I‚Äôll update if anything changes."

I‚Äôd been without a cellphone for a longtime due to being home and just not needing one. I‚Äôve found great support not only through online videos but also through Apple Care is there 100% to help you at no extra cost. I do recommend getting your security in place first thing! So glad I decided to avoid 5g phones with the emerging issues coming out! I‚Äôll never buy a brand new cellphone again! Recommended!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","After I read some reviews I was nervous that the phone was gonna come looking beat up and old, but it came in perfect condition. It was easy to set up, already fully charged, and to my luck there were no scratches or dents. The battery life is at 100% still which is awesome and it only took a week to ship out. Everything works perfectly."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have wanted the iPhone 11 Pro as an upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus because I love the camera upgrade. Surprisingly there is not a noticeable difference in the screen size but there is a definite difference in the phone size.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Entiendo que es un tel√©fono reacondicionado pero desde la configuraci√≥n dec√≠a que no funcionaba el FaceId. Pens√© que lo pod√≠a solucionar una vez que lo configurara, pero terminar de copiar mi tel√©fono a este que compr√© el Face ID sigui√≥ sin funcionar.

Busque en internet y todo pero hab√≠a una falla de la c√°mara, por eso decid√≠ mejor regresarlo porque por mi trabajo, es s√∫per pr√°ctico usar el FaceId"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente bater√≠a, se ve muy completo a excepci√≥n de la c√°mara que es el √∫nico lugar en el que se nota el uso pero m√≠nimamente. üòÉ si algo le llega a fallar editar√© el comentario para avisar üòÅ.
Yo creo que comprar Renewed es cuesti√≥n de suerte! Pero definitivamente con Renewed Premium hay mayor seguridad y los est√°ndares de calidad son mas altos üòä"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iphone lleg√≥ r√°pido, en una caja de Amazon con un certificado de calidad y de inspecci√≥n, tiene garant√≠a de un a√±o y luce completamente nuevo, cable y cargador nuevos gen√©ricos.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a duda de que no me llegar√° esta compra, pero lleg√≥ en la fecha estimada de llegada, sin problemas, el equipo ten√≠a una caja con un cargador (cuadro) y el cable para poder cargar el dispositivo, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con el 80% , se entiende que no son dispositivos nuevos, si no reacondicionadas. En lo fisico solo vienen un ray√≥n en su carcasa en la parte superior izquierda, por el color no se nota mucho, pero todo lo dem√°s el equipo esta en buenas condiciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ bien sellado y en una caja gen√©rica. Cuenta con algunos detalles est√©ticos como algunos rayones en el cromo, pero de ah√≠ en fuera, funciona todo y a la perfecci√≥n.
Si lo compras en oferta, no te arrepentir√°s.

Debido a que es re acondicionado, puede que tenga algunos detalles."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bueno"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ya se calienta cuando est√° mucho tiempo en actividad, y eso que no juego, a 2 semanas que lo compre."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto parece total mente nuevo el √∫nico problema era el nivel de vida de la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 79% pero a√∫n as√≠ me dura todo el d√≠a, 100% recomendado quede encantado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Compra buena"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Sin detalles, me lleg√≥ casi nuevo.
95% de pila y todo funcionando al 100% en esta primera semana de uso"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Por error compr√© el 11 pro cuando en realidad quer√≠a el pro max, vendedor atento, amable y responsable. Todo Perfecto con mi devoluci√≥n de dinero y con la compra del pro Max, encantado con absolutamente todo. Gracias"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me lleg√≥ esteticame te impecable, todo funciona muy bien y la bater√≠a considero que est√° en buena condici√≥n 86%. Muy recomendado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es un dispositivo que destaca en la gran mayor√≠a de situaciones, con buena calidad de c√°mara, bater√≠a, pantalla, tama√±o compacto y sonido. Sin embargo de lo que se debe hablar es de los dispositivos reacondionados, fue mi primer experiencia comprando, pero para mi suerte fue gratamente satisfactorio, como se ve en las fotos es un dispositivo que llego con sus huellas de uso, incluso alguna ca√≠da que pudo haber sufrido pero despu√©s de casi dos meses probando el dispositivo ha funcionado como nuevo. En cuanto a la bater√≠a si llego con 84% de bater√≠a lo cual no me agrado pero con el descuento por el cual me lo compr√© poco pod√≠a decir, Apple ofrece cambio de la bater√≠a en $1700 por tanto podr√≠a ser ese gasto a considerar, sin embargo en dos meses ha bajado 1% el porcentaje de la bater√≠a y en su estado actual me da al rededor de 6 horas de pantalla por lo cual me rinde a mi casi todo el d√≠a, si fuera necesario yo recomiendo esperar a que llegue al 80% de estado en la bater√≠a para su cambio, y realmente as√≠ como va f√°cilmente puedes durar todo un a√±o con esa bater√≠a. Por otra parte recomiendo analizar el n√∫mero de serie y descargar 3Utools para que hagan su propia revisi√≥n, en mi caso vinieron todas las partes originales de serie, hasta donde se puede ver. Yo como les mencione en el t√≠tulo recomiendo que compren con BuySPRY, en mi caso todo ha ido perfecto y con la confianza de Amazon, sus tres meses de garant√≠a as√≠ como la disponibilidad de piezas que te provee Apple, estoy muy contento."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buena relaci√≥n calidad/precio"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo excelente nom√°s la pantalla tiene un ligero ray√≥n"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me gust√≥ que viene en buena calidad, Salvo la bater√≠a tiene 84% pero por el precio lo vale"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","S√∫per relaci√≥n precio calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Solo llego con un peque√±o raspon o desgaste en la esquina ... Se le descarapelo el cromo pero nada importante... Esperaba mas rallones o problemas... Lo que mas me preocupaba era el funcionamiento... Pero hasta la fecha marcha todo bien...llego con 100 de bater√≠a , lo recomiendo si buscas algo bueno bonito y barato.... Viendo esto creo q nunca me animare a comprar un iphone nuevo... La verdad vienen como nuevos y con garantia... Pocaa pero un vendedor particular no da garant√≠a ni financiamiento a msi"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have 4 stars only because it said excellent condition and there was scratches on the side of the phone in a few areas that were quite noticeable. The phone charger it came with charged it extremely slow to the point where it took almost 24 hrs of being plugged in to fully charge. I ended up buying an additional fast charge cord for it instead of using the generic one given. The phone overall is great no issues there. However the battery life was at 87% once again a bit low for something considered excellent condition."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica 10/10 me lleg√≥ con capacidad de bater√≠a al 100 es totalmente recomendable"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Actualizo:
Wilmer, de servicio al cliente, me ayud√≥ para gestionar la devoluci√≥n considerando la garant√≠a de los 90 d√≠as. No podr√≠a estar m√°s satisfecho con Amazon.

Sin embargo el producto que recib√≠ sigue siendo igualmente malo, as√≠ que solo sub√≠ un poco la calificaci√≥n.

Los motivos de mi evaluaci√≥n tan baja son:

P√©simo estado:
- Conector lightning atascado de pelusa y mugre. Igual las bocinas
- Rayones en la panalla que son visibles,
- Rayones en las esquinas del telefono que son evidentes a un brazo de distancia.
- Bater√≠a al 84 % pero se drena por completo en menos de medio d√≠a (desconecto a las 8 para las 12 del d√≠a a est√° muerto),
- Se calienta al cargar via cable,
- Se calienta a√∫n m√°s al cargar via inal√°mbrica,
- Sin haberlo usado nunca (en estos dos meses) en ambientes h√∫medos o haberlo mojado, es frecuente que marque alerta de ""agua en el conector""... as√≠ que me quedo sin pila y no lo puedo cargar por horas
- El Face ID deja de funcionar y tengo que desactivarlo, reiniciar el telefono, volver a registrar Face ID y volver a habilitar cada aplicaci√≥n en la que lo uso .

No encuentro a√∫n c√≥mo hacer v√°lida la garant√≠a Amazon pero preferir√≠a devolverlo..."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Creo que todos tuvimos miedo al comprar un tel√©fono refurbished pero en mi experiencia es una muy buena forma de ahorrar dinero y de cuidar el ambiente
El tel√©fono no presenta detalles m√°s los descritos (peque√±os raspones) muy contento con mi compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En general viene en buen estado, el detalle est√° en la bater√≠a que viene al 83%, que, puede que no sea redituable para m√≠ en el futuro, ya que tendr√© que cambiarla y no es muy barato. Ahora tendr√© que pensar si debo cambiarlo o conservarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Un muy buen equipo cumple las expectativas todo bien con √©l lo recomiendo adquirir"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad hab√≠a escuchado mucho sobre los reacondicionados y tenia algo de temor que no fuera a recibir un producto en buen estado, cual fue mi gran sorpresa me llego el Iphoneen caja gen√©rica plastificada como si fuera de fabrica, al sacarlo de la caja quede fascinado el Iphone me llego como nuevo sin ning√∫n rasp√≥n en en ning√∫n lado, ni en pantalla, muy bien cuidado la bateria la 92% tengo ya 20 dias con el y no me ha fallado para nada los primeros d√≠as por motivos de trabajo por mas o menos una semana tuve que darle un uso muy intenso con la red compartiendo datos con mi laptop lo cual en todo los celulares provoca que se calienten de mas y las bater√≠as se agoten mas rapido pasa en todos este no fue la excepcion lo q ocasiono q si lo cargaba un un dia y medio y eso que soy usuario intenso de twitter, facebook, instagram tik tok lo cual consumen mas rapido la bateria compartir datos hizo q lo cargara una vez al dia aun asi paso muy bien esas pruebas de uso intenso, hice tambi√©n validaciones con 3utools todo es original nada a a sido sustituido incluyendo la bateria es la misma de fabrica en cuanto a su desempe√±o a pesar de que es un iphone de hace 3 a√±os no se queda atras al 2022 sigue dando batalla con holgura, en cuanto a sus camaras siguen siendo de las mejores camaras que hay, las fotografias nocturnas o videos nocturnas salen excelentes en condiciones de poca luz, incluso puede lograr astrofotografia en campos abiertos lejos del ambiente citadino si piensan comprar uno y o lo compre con el vendedor ""electron de mexico"" me dejo maravillado con este reacondicionado en excelente estado como nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad dude en comprar un tel√©fono reacondicionado, pero sali√≥ bien, est√° como nuevo y con 95 de bater√≠a que es la que me preocupaba, lo recomiendo hasta ahorita sin ning√∫n detalle‚Ä¶"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Que est√° en √≥ptimas condiciones y que trabaja bien las Apps"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tengo 3 semanas con el equipo, funciona bien, la bater√≠a dura Perfecto. El cargador que me llego es gen√©rico pero funcione bien en carga r√°pida. El √∫nico tema es que trae un ray√≥n visible en una esquina."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","amazing service, phone is like brand new.Great battery health , no scratches and fully unlocked"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was a bit hesitant to pay over $1K for a refurbished iPhone 11 Pro, but did want a better camera, etc. and did not want to upgrade to the brand new extremely expensive iPhone 12 Pro. I was also a bit disappointed with the iPhone 12 features and new unrounded sides, so felt this was a reasonable gamble to upgrade for the next few years until 5G actually becomes useful and the next 5G chipset in iPhone is more power-efficient. The really beautiful forest green colour added to the desirability, nicer than the 2020 iPhone 12 colour options in my opinion.
The item was unavailable and then back-ordered for a few weeks, but then magically arrived 2 weeks before I expected! I'm very happy with the refurb unit I received - there are no scuffs, dents or other problems - looks like brand new and this 11 Pro has new options with the new wide angle lens for taking lovely pictures. The battery also holds a full charge. They did add a screen protector to the front which makes me wonder if there was a scratch on the screen or some other issue, but the screen looks fine and works flawlessly. I just popped my SIM chip in from my old phone and then transferred all my settings and data over from my old iPhone.
Note that the included phone charger and cable are not Apple items, but an equivalent that works fine. Also, you will not receive an Apple iPhone box containing the refurbished phone - it comes in the vendor's own box with setup instructions, etc.
NOTE: make sure you read the Apple Support article (support.apple.com) on how to properly transfer your settings and data from your old phone to make the process as easy as possible - it will save you a lot of time and effort. Also, make sure you log out of Find My, Messages and iCloud on the old phone *before* you do a final Reset.
Follow-up: I have been using my iPhone 11 Pro for over a month now and everything is great - no issues or regrets. I'm happy I saved a lot of money taking this upgrade route."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es una excelente compra, me llego sin detalles est√©ticos, con una mica ya incluida y bater√≠a al 98% sin lugar a duda 10/10"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Nunca hab√≠a comprado un celular re acondicionado y ten√≠a mucho temor de lo que me iba a llegar. Mi celular lleg√≥ como nuevo, √∫nicamente ten√≠a un peque√±o rasp√≥n en la parte de donde se carga pero fuera de eso, estaba intacto. La bater√≠a estaba al 90% y ya llevo 9 meses us√°ndolo sin ning√∫n problema. No aconsejo comprar el seguro como yo lo hice pues realmente no lo utilice, nunca te mandan muy bien la p√≥liza y no tengo muy claro de a d√≥nde tengo que acudir en caso de que le pase algo. Por el tiempo que tengo ahorita con el celular pienso cambiarlo en unos meses y ya nunca us√© el dichoso seguro. Ya pens√°ndolo bien, creo que si no tienes una tarjeta de banamex con la que sacar un iPhone en la modalidad iPhone for life que creo que vale la pena por el monto decente al mes, comprar un Rea condicionado es una muy buena alternativa. Puedes comprar un equipo un poco m√°s premium a un s√∫per precio. 100% recomendado!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo bueno:
Lleg√≥ en un d√≠a, incluye cargador y cable usb normal a lightning (lo que me gust√≥ mas ya que se me hace m√°s practico que el usbc-lightning).
Esteticamente le pondria un 9.8 tiene una leve rayita imperceptible basicamente en el √°rea de c√°maras (no en los lentes) y los marcos se acero se manchan con el sudor y con las huellas digitales pero se quitan con una linpiada, no se si sea normal.
En el funcionamiento perfecto. En la c√°mara tambi√©n.
Traia puesto una mica de cristal templado, lo que se agradece mucho.
Los contras:
Siento que la bocina frontal duena distorsionada y cuando esta a volumen alto saca aire lo que me hace pensar que ya no es resistente al agua ya wue por ahi podria entrar.
La bateria esta al 81% de su capacidad original por lo que si siento una duraci√≥n menor a la que esperaba.
Considerando que es un reacondicionado y que lo compre en un orecio bajo en el hot sale la verdad es que estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego bien empaquetado, trae accesorios gen√©ricos pero funcionales (Cable y cargador). La pantalla presenta leves rayones que no interfiere en el funcionamiento del dispositivo, son pocos perceptibles a la vista, nada que no se solucione con una mica templada o protector de pantalla. La esquina inferior derecha tiene un ray√≥n, nada que no se solucione con una funda (Case, protector...). La salud de la bater√≠a es de 84%, nada mal para un equipo del 2019, la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a depende de lo que est√©s realizando en el dispositivo, pero en general me dura casi todo el d√≠a.

Este iPhone lo compre para cambiar mi iPhone 7. La salud de la pila de este dispositivo se deterioro mucho, en menos de una hora me quedaba sin pila. El micr√≥fono no serv√≠a, no pod√≠a hacer llamadas, excepto conectando unos aud√≠fonos bluetooth. Adem√°s, el iPhone 7 ya no es compatible con iOS 16. Por cierto, mi iPhone 7 tambi√©n es Reacondicionado y me duro bastante.

Fue una buena compra, estoy satisfecho con el iPhone 11 Pro..."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto es seminuevo pero en buen estado relativamente ya que se le ven rayones en las esquinas, el cargador no es original y viene dentro de caja cualquiera. Vino con un 79% de bater√≠a de vida üíîüëéüèª"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Esta opini√≥n la estoy realizando despu√©s de usar por 1 a√±o el iPhone. Cuando lo compre ten√≠a da√±os de uso, nada fuera de lo normal, me encanto, lo recomendio bastante. SIN EMBARGO, cuando me lo vendieron ten√≠a 93% de pila de vida y ahora solo le queda 77%‚Ä¶.."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tiene est√©tica de 10 y la bater√≠a tiene una capacidad del 85%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo compr√© para regalarlo a mi mam√°, lleg√≥ aparentemente bien, sin rayones ni se√±ales de mucho uso. La capacidad de la bater√≠a era del 82% (lo cual cumple con lo prometido en la publicaci√≥n), el tema es que se calienta un poco luego de unos minutos de uso y la ubicaci√≥n por gps es muy intermitente e inexacta."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo compre, llego en buen estado. Han cambiado la parte trasera del iPhone y no hay problema con eso. El √∫nico detalle que tiene despu√©s de m√°s de un mes de uso es que el micr√≥fono no se escucha muy fuerte desde el primer d√≠a que lo recib√≠, cuando hablo con otra persona tienen que subir el volumen al m√°ximo para escucharme. El celular fuera de eso me llego con un 99% de vida de bater√≠a, se ve bien y no tiene ninguna otra falla as√≠ que decid√≠ qued√°rmelo a pesar del detalle del micr√≥fono. Si lo recomendar√≠a se entiende que es reacondicionado y por el precio es una buena opci√≥n (lo compre en primeday en 480dls aproximadamente)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono viene en muy buenas condiciones est√©ticas, no se notan rayaduras en la parte est√©tica, la bater√≠a 82% al raz de lo que se indica en la publicaci√≥n el √∫nico detalle fue con el altavoz de la parte superior que lleg√≥ defectuoso pero de ah√≠ en fuera todo correctamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","To start, this is one of the best phone I have used!

Even though it was a refurbished phone. The quality was 100%. Not a single scratch/dent/marks nor anything. Truly brand new quality. So, I was very impressed when I received the product.

The box didn't have the Apple branded cable and cube charger but I am totally ok with that.

The metal body gives it a really premium feel on touch, as it is Gorilla Glass back and front with stainless steel frame. The phone is IP68 dust/water resistant but I never try to test it.

The display is an Super Retina XDR OLED, HDR10, Dolby Vision with 800 nits (typ), 1200 nits (peak). With such high quality I am still not used to this small 5.8 inches screen. Even though it has 458 ppi density.

The Apple A13 Bionic chip makes everything so lightning fast, multi-tasking is a breeze.

The 3 front cameras are as follow:
12 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.55"", 1.4¬µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS
12 MP, f/2.0, 52mm (telephoto), 1/3.4"", 1.0¬µm, PDAF, OIS, 2x optical zoom
12 MP, f/2.4, 120Àö, 13mm (ultrawide), 1/3.6""

Everything makes it look so nice, bright. It is true what they said. iPhone makes taking a nice picture a breeze. It makes sure you can take a quality picture everything you press the button. Without adjusting anything. Just click and that's it. Same with the selfie camera in its quality. Just superb quality!

Stereo speakers is really ggood as well.

The Li-Ion 3046 mAh battery will last for 2-3 days based on my daily use.

Really like the phone, good quality. But definitely over-priced compare to other phones out there in now 2021 market."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es la primera vez que compro algo Reacondicionado, llevo 8 d√≠as us√°ndolo y en general considero fue una buena compra.

El equipo lleg√≥ bien empaquetado, no es la caja original (como podr√°n observar en las im√°genes) pero cumple su funci√≥n de protegerlo, el celular tiene detalles m√≠nimos en los costado, como de uso normal cuando no le colocas una carcasa reci√©n comprado, la pantalla tiene detalles pero igual son casi imperceptibles y no se sienten al tacto, para mi no hay problema alguno respecto a eso. Repito, llevo 8 d√≠as usando el celular y hasta el momento todo bien, funciona como nuevo, el √∫nico detalle es que la Capacidad m√°xima de la bater√≠a es de 87%, aun que tampoco es tan malo para mi.

Las √∫nicas razones por las cuales no le doy 5 estrellas es porque el adaptador de corriente (el cuadrito) no funciona bien, como mencionan en la descripci√≥n tanto el adaptador como el cable USB (cargador) no son originales y el adaptador se siente y se ve de muy mala calidad, eso y por la capacidad m√°xima de la bater√≠a.

Recomiendo que siempre lean las rese√±as, con base a ellas fue que decid√≠ comprar el celular con este proveedor y hasta el momento no me arrepiento, mas adelante escribir√© otra rese√±a porque 8 d√≠as de uso es relativamente poco tiempo.

Nota: En la imagen en donde se ve el logo, la manzana no tiene ning√∫n detalle, s√≥lo es una mancha de mis dedos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente producto para el precio que esta publicado, lo pedi con temor de que saliera defectuoso, tengo 2 semanas con el y ha funcionado perfecto. Tiene detalles minimos en la parte posterior de la camara que solamente se ven si te acercas detalladamente. La bateria venia al 84% por lo que no le pongo las 5 estrellas. Fuera de eso. Me parece un excelente producto. Viene en caja de carton generica con cargador y cable genericos que funcionan bien.
En conclusion, cumple con las expectativas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad es que el producto llego un d√≠a despu√©s de lo esperado pero llego bien empaquetado, inclu√≠a un cubo y cable (no se ven de muy buena calidad) pero se agradece que traiga, el dispositivo llego con 83% en bater√≠a pero eso depende de cada iPhone, los bordes est√°n muy bien cuidados al igual que la parte trasera y c√°maras, por enfrente llego con mica de cristal ( tiene dos ligeros rayones en la pantalla ) pero nada que realmente afecte. Pagas por un producto ‚Äúusado‚Äù pero de buenas condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me llego sin la caja de iPhone, llego antes de tiempo y ha funcionado bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llevo unos 3-4 meses con el tel√©fono, me llego con el 87% de bater√≠a, no se calienta ni ha tenido ninguna falla. Lo recomiendo la verdad"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La descripci√≥n e incluso en las especificaciones de la caja dec√≠a que ven√≠a con arriba del 90% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a la cual no cumpli√≥, y ven√≠a con el 85%.
5% es bastante en un celular de esta marca"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Una buena opci√≥n para adquirir un iPhone sin pagar tanto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Compra justa, sin embargo tienes que tener suerte para que llegue un equipo con buen porcentaje de bater√≠a, eso si del 80% no baja.
A mi me llego con un porcentaje del 83%, la verdad tiene detalles m√≠nimos, debes ponerle mucha atenci√≥n para percatarte de ellos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El cel est√° impecable, parece nuevo, el √∫nico detalle es que el cable del cargador que viene duro un par de meses y tuve que comprarlo nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hola, el producto llego en perfectas condiciones, pero con una bater√≠a al 84%, todo lo dem√°s al 100"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La bater√≠a su capacidad al 87% no me gusto, por lo dem√°s, tel√©fono impecable y funciona perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Agarre una s√∫per promo en hotsale, todo iba bien cuando me lleg√≥ hasta que escuche la bocina de las llamadas y sonaba volada, lo iba a regresar hasta que lo lleve a apple y s√≥lo era limpieza lo revisaron y lo evaluaron 10 de 10 y bater√≠a al 100% hasta ahora todo ok, la neta me raye"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es una excelente oportunidad, sin embargo microfono y bocina estan da√±ados, me hubiera gustado que mencionaran eso en la descripci√≥n, todo lo demas funciona perfecto, es muy normal en los iphone ese detalle.

recomiendo ampliamente, volver√≠a a comprar sin duda."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ en muy buen estado, y me pareci√≥ un excelente precio."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un poco m√°s de 85% de vida y el tel√©fono se ve en buen estado sin golpes, lo √∫nico que no me agrado fue que ten√≠a unas ligeras manchas en la parte de atr√°s, est√°s solo son visibles si inspecciones a fondo el tel√©fono."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Resiste lo que sea, se me ha ca√≠do el iPhone muchas veces y sigue impecable"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hay un detalle muy peque√±o que solo se ve muy de cerca y con un protector de pantalla ya no se ve"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pues para el precio creo que pueden ofrecer un mejor producto, apenas lo recib√≠ hoy pero los detalles son notorios m√°s un ray√≥n en la pantalla que es muy visible a la luz de d√≠a y a la luz de la pantalla, lo probar√© una semana porque llego con 88% de bater√≠a entonces ver√© si vale la pena la est√©tica"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","excelente producto, unico detalle ligero rayon en pantalla pero en lo demas 10/10. La bateria llego en 85%, Face id funcionando perfectamente.
En general el equipo no me ha dado ning√∫n problema, facil dura la bateria el dia entero con uso moderado, tiempos de carga acorde y no tienen ning√∫n sobre calentamiento. Con una funda que proteja completo al equipo queda perfecto, recomiendo ampliamente el producto y al vendedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en buen estado, en cuanto a est√©tica todo s√∫per bien s√≥lo que en la pantalla ven√≠an algunos rayones muy m√≠nimos no afecta en nada puedo decir que esta 9.8 de est√©tica. la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 89% lleg√≥ en 3 d√≠as a Mexico. Precio $10,199 es peque√±o de 5.8 pulgadas me imagin√© que ser√≠a m√°s grande. Es mi primera vez usando IPhone y puedo decir que lo recomiendo ampliamente. Espero no aplicar la garant√≠a y que me siga funcionando al 100% ya llevo un mes y no me ha presentado ninguna falla."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ antes de lo esperado.Por el momento muy bien, no not√© ning√∫n ray√≥n en la pantalla ni en el cuerpo del equipo, parece literalmente nuevo! Y adem√°s de eso la capacidad de la bater√≠a esta al 99% as√≠ que ninguna queja, hare un update si algo cambia o noto alg√∫n inconveniente, hasta el momento todo perfecto.UPDATE 1 de noviembre del 2022Despu√©s de 5 meses de uso la capacidad m√°xima de la bater√≠a se ha reducido dr√°sticamente en un 10% de ser del 99% ahora est√° al 89% me parece que ha decrecido de forma exponencial a pesar de que cuido mucho los ciclos de carga del tel√©fono, esto ya no me est√° encantando como al principio."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Comparto mi experiencia del producto.Me lleg√≥ con la pantalla intacta sin ning√∫n rayon notable al igual que la parte trasera, no obstante los marcos en la parte superior e inferior tenian dos abollones que supongo son marcas de alguna caida. La condici√≥n de la pila estaba a un 81%, eso no me gust√≥ tanto la verdad ya que mi actual iPhone a 4 a√±os de tenerlo consta del 78% y no es gran diferencia.Venia con el cargador (bastante generico) y el cable de datos, falt√≥ la herramienta para sacar la tarjeta Sim.Al momento de querer transferir mis datos al finalizar me mostraba un mensaje de ‚ÄúNo se pudo encontrar Iphone‚Äù y tenia de borrar todo y empezar de nuevo.Por esos detalles decid√≠ regresarlo e iniciar el proceso de reembolso."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Gran compra, dud√© en la calidad y estado de bater√≠a y lleg√≥ con 99% pero es pr√°cticamente nuevo. Recomendado 100%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto est√©ticamente se ve bien, ven√≠a con un protector de pantalla que inteligentemente cubr√≠a un ray√≥n en la parte superior de la pantalla, pero el gran problema son las bocinas, o est√°n voladas o simplemente se escuchan mal y poco, tengo un mes con √©l y pens√© que no iba afectar esa situaci√≥n, pero cada que pongo una llamada en altavoz simplemente se escucha muy bajo y con ruido y aunque dice que uno puede devolver en los 90 d√≠as para solicitar un cambio o devoluci√≥n, no se muestra ninguna opci√≥n para realizarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono en general est√° bien aunque cuenta con un ray√≥n muy llamativo en la pantalla, lo √∫nico que si me disgust√≥ mucho a comparaci√≥n de otros comentarios es que solo cont√≥ con un 81% de vida la pila, cuando otros cuentan que viene incluso hasta con 95, 96% aprox."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen producto solo que en las llamadas se escucha muy distorsionada y grave la voz. Y tambi√©n se calienta en algunas ocasiones, sin necesidad de mucho uso."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buena compra, el tel√©fono est√©ticamente de 10, la bocina algo da√±ada pero por el precio no me quejo, en 3 meses todo lo dem√°s funciona Perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","en si, es un muy buen celular, el color es muy bonito un tama√±o que lo hace c√≥modo para traer en la mano, y por el precio hacen que tengas un tel√©fono relativamente nuevo con la diferencia al comprarlo a un desconocido, de que tienes una empresa que respalda con garant√≠a limitada, pero una garant√≠a; los detalles son que promet√≠an un minimo del 90% en condici√≥n de bateria y llego con un 88%, venia la pantalla con rayones superficiales, no profundos pero si visibles los cuales no afectan el funcionamiento del tel√©fono solo est√©tica, y tampoco tra√≠a la herramienta de extracci√≥n de la tarjeta SIM, detalle al parecer poco importante, pero si no tienes otro, andas buscando alfileres o clips cada vez que necesites quitar la tarjeta."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo viene bien,tiene detalles est√©ticos muy leves que con la funda no se perciben , s√≥lo ven√≠a con un cargador gen√©rico y la bater√≠a ven√≠a a una capacidad del 85% , dura un d√≠a y medio aprox.La verdad es que ten√≠a mucho miedo por los malos comentarios, pero me toco buena suerte , creo que lo volver√≠a a comprar; espero les ayude mi comentario."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hasta el momento bastante sorprendida, tardo un poco en llegar pero parece nuevo, viene con bater√≠a al 98%, la est√©tica de 10. Voy a continuar utiliz√°ndolo, si se mantiene as√≠ cambiare a 5 estrellas."

 Tengo casi un mes con el tel√©fono, no hab√≠a escrito mi experiencia porque quer√≠a revisar que todo funcionara y por ahora todo est√° perfecto.
El √∫nico detalle que encontr√© al recibirlo fue que la caja en la que llego, estaba semi abierta; en cambio, la caja que ven√≠a dentro con el tel√©fono estaba en perfecto estado.
Llego con los accesorios descritos en la publicaci√≥n, cargador y cable gen√©ricos funcionando.
Llego sin mica protectora y con super m√≠nimos detalles en la pantalla, relativamente imperceptibles.
La bater√≠a al 100% de su capacidad.
Botones, sensores y c√°mara funcionando perfectamente.
Si durante el tiempo de garant√≠a sucediera algo, editar√© mi rese√±a. Por ahora recomiendo el producto."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono venia con unos peque√±os rayoncitos en la pantalla pero solo se notaban con la pantalla apagada y en ciertos √°ngulos con la luz. Cuando le puse el protector de pantalla de cristal, es como si hubieran desaparecido, no se notan para nada.

El cargador con el que lo entregan es gen√©rico y no es de carga r√°pida, pero funciona perfecto y se ve de buena calidad.
Fuera de eso, el tel√©fono esta perfecto, no he tenido ning√∫n problema, funciona de maravilla y por el precio, vale mucho la pena, s√≠ lo recomiendo"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","13/10/22 :| sin duda una oferta tentadora a primera vista, un precio accesible por un tel√©fono de tan alta gama. ¬øA qu√© cost√≥? tu suerte, el tel√©fono puede ser un 10/10, impecable, sin detalles. O, puede ser tambi√©n un 1/10, deteriorado, golpeado, raspado y desgastado. Lamentable el segundo fue mi caso, todos los botones tallados y el tel√©fono constantemente a alta temperatura, la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a en un 77% marcando ‚Äúmantenimiento‚Äù. No dudo que puedan salir buenos tel√©fonos de √©sta atractiva oferta, pero no fue mi caso. Estoy en proceso de devoluci√≥n. ¬øMi recomendaci√≥n? Buscar lo original, nuevo y garantizado; en mi caso, me decant√© por adquirir el iPhone 13 mini en la p√°gina oficial. Saludos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buena relacion calidad precio.
El articulo pese a que se Renew, llego en muy buenas condiciones tanto esteticas, como de funcinamiento.
La bateria con un estado de salud mayor al 90%. Al momento con telcel y At&t funciona sin problema.

El unico contra que no tiene compatibilidad para funcional con la banda de telefonia 28, por lo que si eres usuario de altan o alguna OMV (Pillophone, Newww, Bait, etc) que funcione con las redes de altan, no podras usarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cumple con lo que ofrecen, cumple con mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tengo 3 meses con el equipo y funciona muy bien, de est√©tica solo ten√≠a un rayon sobre un costado pero el resto como si fuera nuevo."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente equipo, lo √∫nico que le veo de malo es que la pila me marca al 86% de capacidad, pero no afecta que afecte su funcionamiento"

C√°maras, pantalla, sensores, bocinas y botones en buen estado, viene con cargador y cable gen√©rico. Bater√≠a al 85% de vida. Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ fue que no soporta la banda 28 entonces no es compatible con Altan."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En funcionalidad al 100. Est√©tica si deja mucho que desear. Pero en fin, eso lo sab√≠amos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica 8/10, algunos rayones en pantalla y marco de c√°mara, nada que se note demasiado ni que afecte el funcionamiento, con un case no se nota en absoluto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ justo en el tiempo que me hab√≠an dicho, sin embargo, a la hora de abrir el producto no ven√≠a ning√∫n papel que dec√≠a que era certificado o algo as√≠, √∫nicamente el equipo (con una protecci√≥n tenue y envuelto en papel) y el cable de carga con el adaptador. No me lleg√≥ el gancho para sacar la sim.Internamente el tel√©fono lleg√≥ bien, nada se traba y con un 83% de bater√≠a (esperaba m√°s pero el anuncio era claro). Sin embargo, la pantalla estaba bastante rayada de los laterales y era bastante notorio a un brazo de distancia.En general bien, pero por el precio que se pago (12,800 mxn) esperaba una pantalla intacta."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buen producto! En excelente estado! Lo √∫nico que no se me hizo de buena calidad fue el cargador con el que viene. Pero de ah√≠ todo s√∫per bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Good for the price, battery 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","pues nunca hab√≠a comprado un producto reacondicionado y dec√≠an unos usuarios que era un riesgo . y por lo menos en mi caso este producto sali√≥ muy bueno , nada de fallas y nada casi nada de detalles est√©ticos , yo estoy contento con este producto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo viene sin detalles aparentes, la tapa trasera y bordes sin detalles, se ve perfecto!Ven√≠a con un cristal en pantalla que igual lo hace ver genial, sin embargo vi comentarios de que las utilizaban para disimular rayones, y en efecto, al removerla la pantalla ten√≠a m√∫ltiples rayones peque√±os y algunos m√°s marcados. Con mica no se ven as√≠ que no tengo problemas.En cuanto al rendimiento, el porcentaje de vida de la bater√≠a es del 98 % bastante bien!Satisfecha con la compra, si hay algun cambio modificar√© esta rese√±a."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo viene en muy buenas condiciones, con excepci√≥n del eliminador de corriente del cargador, ya que, sobrecalienta el equipo y a medida que lo usas se calienta demasiado. Cambi√°ndolo por un eliminador original el tel√©fono dej√≥ de sobrecalentarse. El estado de la bater√≠a ven√≠a con un 98% de retenci√≥n de carga y a medida del tiempo (Un par de meses) se redujo a 88%. Cosa normal considerando que es un equipo reacondicionado y estuvo apagado por demasiado tiempo, con el tiempo arroj√≥ la retenci√≥n real de bateria."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto se entiende que es reacondicionado, solo trae un peque√±o detalle en el cristal de la pantalla un ray√≥n pero muy peque√±o como que no ten√≠a mica protectora, la pila tiene una vida del 97% funciona muy bien y por el precio que pague estoy conforme ya que se siente la calidad de los productos apple he tenido tambi√©n gamas alta de android a decir verdad siempre me han durado mas los iphones, por eso esta vez quise volver a esta marca, se que mucha gente desconf√≠a de lo reacondicionado al menos aqu√≠ en Amazon he obtenido buenos productos, me da mucha confianza comprar aqu√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Al igual que muchos, tenia duda al hacer la compra de un producto que no es completamente nuevo, el leer comentarios de estafas o malos productos te deja mucho que desear; decid√≠ hacerlo para probar la experiencia de Amazon con productos reacondicionados y me sorprendi√≥ la respuesta.El producto llego mucho antes de lo esperado, el paquete contiene todo acorde a las especificaciones del vendedor tal cual como aparece en la descripci√≥n, con est√©tica de 9 casi como nuevo ( diminutos rasgu√±os de uso en los bordes ) pero estamos consientes que no es un producto nuevo, la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a es del 90% bastante decente para un producto que no es nuevo. En general todo le funciona a la perfecci√≥n hasta el momento; antes de que termine la garant√≠a de Amazon regresare a reportar como continua el funcionamiento del equipo despu√©s de tiempo.Buena relacion precio beneficio."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular realmente estaba nuevo por que ten√≠a el 100 %en estado de capacidad de bater√≠a m√°s no me agrado que lo mandaron con protector de cristal ya puesto para que no viera que ten√≠a un tremendo ray√≥n en pantalla y me di cuenta 2 semanas despu√©s que le dio curiosidad de por que con cristal ya puesto, eso me decepcion√≥ vi otros detalles est√©ticos que pens√© est√° bien por algo estaba barato no importa yo sab√≠a que era con detalles por que esta especificado que no es nuevo de f√°brica pero el hecho de ocultar un ray√≥n no me pareci√≥, todo lo dem√°s excelente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto me lleg√≥ muy bien y antes del tiempo indicado. Si quiero mencionar que al principio estuve a punto de devolver el celular porque trae algunos detalles de raspones en la pantalla, nada grave. Pero si me gustar√≠a que Amazon tuviera un mejor est√°ndar de valoraci√≥n en sus productos, a pesar de que uno sabe de antemano que el producto es usado, pero aun as√≠ el precio es considerable. De manera general el celular me ha funcionado muy bien. La bater√≠a me lleg√≥ con 94% y el desempe√±o del celular es muy bueno. La soluci√≥n que le di a los detalles fue comprar un protector de pantalla de cristal y se ve como nuevo! Gracias Amazon!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ en tiempo y forma, ten√≠a muchas dudas respecto a la compra, el √∫nico pero que le pondr√≠a es la bater√≠a con un m√°ximo de 82% de carga, fuera de eso todo perfecto con el producto, quedo satisfecho"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Actualizaci√≥n: decid√≠ devolverlo porque tras 1 mes de uso, bajo 2% la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a y se calentaba mucho con los datos prendidos. Si no eres exigente es una muy buena opci√≥n‚Ä¶..Hasta ahora ha funcionado bien, llego con 89% de bater√≠a, tiene ligeros rayones en la pantalla pero son pr√°cticamente imperceptibles. He notado que se caliente mucho la parte de atr√°s por debajo de la c√°mara cuando uso los datos m√≥viles por un tiempo prolongado, si uso la c√°mara mucho tiempo y a veces cuando se esta cargando. Est√©tica 9.5/10.Hare una actualizaci√≥n mas adelante sobre este calentamiento, si no me convence hare valida la garant√≠a!!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This product is great. Every feature works perfectly and battery is at 100% capacity. It‚Äôs not 5 stars cause when I removed the included screen protector there were a bunch of scratches. However, since I only use my phone with screen protectors and it completely covers up said scratches, this personally isn‚Äôt a big dealbreaker to me. If having scratches at all is a big deal to you, just giving you a warning that your iPhone may come with scratches. Other than that, I‚Äôm satisfied with the product :). And yes, the iPhone is real, no other damage besides that"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular llego en excelente condiciones, venia en una cajita muy cool , al principio pens√© que tenia unos rayones pero era c√≥mo pegamento, despu√©s de limpiarlo qued√≥ muy bien, podr√≠a decir que le doy un 10 de est√©tica ya que de verdad no trae ning√∫n golpe o ray√≥n, la bater√≠a llego en 93% creo que igual est√° muy bien, adem√°s el precio en el que lo compr√© fue muy bueno ya que fue de oferta por el hot sale y ahora he visto que subi√≥ mucho, me quedo muy satisfecho con la compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","al tel√©fono le cambiaron demasiadas piezas para mi opini√≥n le cambiaron la pantalla la bater√≠a y la c√°mara la c√°mara quedo muy mal instalada cuando abro la c√°mara se traba demasiado y cuando muevo el celular con la c√°mara se mueve muy trabado y cuando tomo una foto se traba aun mas y cuando cambio el modo de foto se traba aun mas la verdad todo de la c√°mara esta horrible para el dinero que costo y el tipo de tel√©fono que es, tambi√©n el touch aveces no detecta bien la verdad solo esas piezas logre saber que se cambiaron pero no se si le abran cambiado mas cosas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto me gusto, llego en buen estado, ligeros detalles est√©ticos que se notan solo si lo miras muy a detalle, pila al 86%. Todo funciona excelentemente. Me gusto y el precio es bueno"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El art√≠culo lleg√≥ en muy buen estado solo pocos rayones en pantalla pero en general bien lo √∫nico y creo para m√≠ es lo m√°s malo que el porcentaje de bater√≠a me llego con el 81% lo malo que dentro de poco tendr√© que cambiarla."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone lleg√≥ en excelente estado est√©tica de 9.7 solo tiene unos peque√±os puntos en la tapa de atr√°s que solo se distinguen a contra luz ( se han de ver hecho con la funda ) funciona de maravilla, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ al 93% y 4 meses despu√©s ya la tengo al 85% pero a√∫n funciona bien en optimizaci√≥n.Lo recomiendo mucho, lo consegu√≠ a 6 MSI y el costo fue de 14,500 el 11 pro de 256gbMuy conforme con la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Al pasar de unos meses comenz√≥ a fallar la bocina y el reconocimiento facial; fuera de eso la est√©tica es muy buena"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono por fuera est√° en impecables condiciones pero por dentro de bater√≠a est√° en 80% y las bocinas no se escuchan bien lo tengo que devolver"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llevo 3 semanas y hasta el d√≠a de hoy s√∫per bien, est√©tica 9.8 pero pr√°cticamente como nuevo, √∫nico detalle a considerar bater√≠a en 87% de su capacidad. De repente las llamadas tardan en salir un poco, pero quiero pensar es mi compa√±√≠a telef√≥nica. Realmente sorprendi√≥ por el gran producto que recib√≠, sin duda muy recomendable. Espero todo siga como hasta hoy."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ en una cajita de pl√°stico, el cargador obviamente es gen√©rico (si fuera original sin duda se lleva un 10 de calificaci√≥n) 512gb de almacenamiento, lleg√≥ con un 92% de bater√≠a, marcas m√≠nimas de uso. El equipo muy bonito. Lo malo fue que lo ped√≠ en verde media noche y lleg√≥ en color oro. Por el precio lo recomiendo y tambi√©n por la fluidez, para el 2022 no le pide nada a los modelos actuales Android de media gama que rondan en precios similares. Sin duda una buena compra. Saludos desde la CDMX espero les sirva mi opini√≥n. Si pueden adquirir el iPhone 11pro max lo recomiendo mas ya que trae bater√≠a y pantalla mas grande que el 11pro."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me lleg√≥ sin rayones, como nuevo bater√≠a al 85% lo √∫nico malo es que cuando lo pongo a cargar se calienta much√≠simo.Es r√°pido, le dura mucho la bater√≠a y la c√°mara est√° genial cambie mi 6s por este y la verdad si no se calentar√° le dar√≠a 5 estrellas."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El dispositivo llego con una muy buena est√©tica, algunos rayones en la pantalla pero solo se notan a contra luz, lo malo es que me llego con 86% de bater√≠a y a veces siento que dura muy poco, tal vez haga valida la garant√≠a si es as√≠ editare la rese√±a con dicha experiencia."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","el producto me llego con rayones en la parte de las bocinas y de la c√°mara frontal, llevo 30 min intentando actualizar el celular y solo dice ""preparando actualizaci√≥n"""
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Incre√≠ble llevo 3 meses con el equipo y no ha tenido ni una falla, la pila me llego con 99% y sin ray√≥n alguno. Si duda alguna lo recomiendo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Decepcionante: La bocina suena plasticosa, bajo y extra√±o, la pantalla no s√© si sea percepci√≥n m√≠a pero da tonalidades no tan fieles y la se√±al movil hay que alternar el modo avi√≥n para que quiera obedecer. Por otro lado rayones y bater√≠a al 87% que era algo a lo que estaba consciente previamente pero por lo anterior me decepcion√≥; el producto pudo ser bastante bueno en relaci√≥n precio pero esos aspectos son clave, ni quise arriesgarlo a una gota de agua o ca√≠da despu√©s de ver esos detalles üò∞.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","lo √∫nico que no me pareci√≥ es que lo abrieron y le cambiaron la pantalla por una generica, ademas el modulo de las c√°maras ten√≠a tornillos por dentro, pero ya quedo, lo demas muy bien"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iphone 11 pro adquirido llego sin contratiempos.En cuanto a la estetica del aparato tiene un 8/10, no tiene rayones o golpes. El bisel de acero no esta bien colocado y se obseva una separacion en la parte superior izquierda e inclusive se obsevan particulas de polvo. Trae una una mica de cristal en la pantalla y los complementos cable y cargador son genericos como lo indica amazon renewedEn cuanto a la funcionalidad del telefono:1. El telefono no vienen con una bateria original o genuina de apple y es lo primero que te indica el telefono, una vez que lo enciendes y comienzas la configuracion inicial. Dada la condicion de la bateria no es posible verificar el porcetanje que promete amazon renewed del al menos 80%. Con el primer dia de uso el telefono se calienta y la bateria se descarga rapidamente. El telefono se apaga repentinamente.2. El iphone 11 pro, llego con una version de software 14.4.1. Fue un calvario poderlo actualizar a la version 15.4.1 para poder migrar los datos de un viejo telefono a este que llego. No se puede actualizar el ios desde el mismo telefono, se tuvo que usar una macbook pro para hacer el proceso de actualizacion3. Tiene problemas para detectar algunos dispositivos bluetooth, se tiene que encender y apagar el bluetooth varias vecesConclusionesEl telefono no cumple con la promesa de ser un producto de calidad, inspeccionada y probada para trabajar de amazon renewed. Si luce como nuevo el telefono, pero el detalle de la bateria y el descuadre del bisel, evidencia que un deficiente control de calidad en los productos. ademas de no venderlo con almenos una version de ios 15. El vendedor de este telefono es BuySPRY, que tiene buenas calificaciones, motivo por eo cual me anime a hacer la compra, pero me llevo una total decepcionPor lo anterior mi calificacion es de una estrella y devolvere el producto solicitando el reembolso de lo pagado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo he utilizado 5 meses hasta ahora, en dos ocasiones las celdas de la bater√≠a se han descalibrado (se arregla descargando totalmente el equipo y volvi√©ndolo a cargar) y pues fuera de eso funciona muy bien y est√©ticamente est√° como nuevo"

After several days of use, the device has no issues whatsoever that I can discern.The only minor issue was that the shipment was held up for a full week and I had some trouble getting a clear answer as to why on Amazon Chat - it ended up being a payment authorization issue.

A m√≠ me fue muy bien en tanto a est√©tica y uso: 10/10. Pero en bater√≠a me fue un poco normal, me lleg√≥ con condici√≥n de 82%, aun as√≠ me dura todo un d√≠a completo. La verdad yo si volver√≠a a comprar otro acondicionado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Al igual que muchas otras personas dude si el comprar un Reacondicionado era buena opci√≥n. La verdad es que estoy m√°s que satisfecho con el producto, el tel√©fono est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo, en cuanto est√©tica solo pude encontrarle un detalle m√≠nimo y cabe decir que soy muy especial con esos detalles pero no tiene absolutamente nada mal, ni un ray√≥n a la pantalla ni ning√∫n vicio oculto despu√©s de un mes de uso continuo el cual espere para hacer la rese√±a. La bater√≠a me llego con el 98% y se ha mantenido as√≠, as√≠ que t√©cnicamente recib√≠ un tel√©fono nuevo a un excelente precio.Vendedor: Achemex"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ en perfecto estado, bater√≠a al 98% lo √∫nico malo es que se calienta demasiado pero para el precio esta s√∫per bien, yo lo recomendar√≠a."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No le pide nada a uno nuevo, llego impecable"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","estoy muy contento y satisfecho con mi iphone 11 pro, tiene una serie de utilidades que no contaba con ellas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo regrese porque ven√≠a con muy poca bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas al ser un producto re-acondicionado, me anime por la garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as. El iPhone llego al d√≠a siguiente y en perfectas condiciones est√©ticas. Bater√≠a al 86%. Han pasado 3 d√≠as y funciona perfecto, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tiene una bocina reventada :("
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono dice que la capacidad m√°xima es de 100% as√≠ que creo que est√° bien en ese aspecto pero vino de la c√°mara frontal s√∫per rayado y de la parte de atr√°s justo en la manzana esta como despintado y muy polvoriento en el micr√≥fono frontal, no me convence por eso."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This phone is amazing and super easy to set up. Was worried buying used with some of the reviews but it was 100% worth it! Came with a scratch on the metal but it‚Äôs so tiny and you can‚Äôt see it when you put the phone in a case."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo llego bien y la bater√≠a al 100, pero al mes y medio de uso me est√° fallando no se si la bater√≠a o el centro de carga, solito deja de cargar tengo que conectar y desconectar para que agarre"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo est√° en buen estado, solo no me convenci√≥ la vida de la bater√≠a que ven√≠a al 87% y una de la bocinas se escucha distorsionada. Solo por eso le doy 3 estrellas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Una buena compra para el precio, est√° claro que es un producto reacondicionado. Hasta el momento ha resultado muy bien y est√° en buenas condiciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente producto, el unico problema es que me llego rayado de la pantalla, lo demas bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Acabo de recibir el equipo y la verdad me gusto pero me desilusiona que no cumplan con lo que describen, me lleg√≥ con 78% de bater√≠a y sin llave para sacar el sim, veremos qu√© tal funciona, ya estar√© modificando este comentario en el futuro.Ojo: si compras este producto o cualquier otro equipo restaurado, rev√≠salo bien y que cumplan al 100% con lo que describen."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego bien solamente tiene manchas en la parte de atr√°s pero supongo que es por el uso de est√©tica le doy un 8,5"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Para haberlo comprado en $9,999 mxn cre√≠ que vendr√≠a con algo notorio, pero lleg√≥ s√∫per bien, llevo 1 mes y no ha fallado de nada, tuve miedo al principio por ser Rea condicionado pero vali√≥ totalmente la pena!! Lleg√≥ con 83% de bater√≠a pero rinde much√≠simo, muy bien!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The speaker on the screen came super dirty, yuck! Not even sure there‚Äôs a way to clean it? Battery life was 84%."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Beyond expectations! No signs of prior usage, battery health was at 100% (which was better than what I had started with on my previous iPhone from Apple). Packaging was great, came with a glass screen protector outfitted on the device. Runs smoothly, supports all my needs, basically everything I was looking for. My friends & family had doubts when they heard I was purchasing for a reseller, but the phone I received might as well be brand new. I specifically purchased from Amazon so I could get the 11 Pro which is no longer sold by Apple at this time but I‚Äôm thinking I will be a repeat customer when it comes time for a new phone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hasta el momento muy bien lo recomiendo me lleg√≥ est√©ticamente impecable y 92 de bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es una excelente opci√≥n el tel√©fono est√° certificado por Amazon y Apple, tra√≠a el 100% de bater√≠a y sin ning√∫n detalle est√©tico o en el funcionamiento del telefono"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto en cuesti√≥n de est√©tica lleg√≥ muy bien, nada de rayones ni golpes; sin embargo no cumple con la condici√≥n de bater√≠a. Tra√≠a una hoja de cumplimiento arriba de 90, pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con el 88% as√≠ que es lo √∫nico con lo que no cumpli√≥."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad ten√≠a miedo de comprar este tipo de art√≠culos reacondicionados y pues como vi en muchos videos, esto es al azar. Puede llegar algo bueno o algo no tan bueno pero la garant√≠a lo respalda.El m√≠o afortunadamente lleg√≥ intacto a excepci√≥n de la pantalla un tanto rayada pero nada graveLa condici√≥n de bater√≠a al 98% y me ha funcionado perfectamente en estas semanas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me gust√≥ el precio para ser de 256gb.La salud de la bater√≠a estaba en 90%Ven√≠a con una Mica de cristal incluida, no me gusta mucho tener el m√≥vil con Mica de cristal y se la quit√©, me di cuenta de que la pantalla ten√≠a demasiados rayones, muchos peque√±os que solo se ven con luz y otros muy marcados.Eso no me gust√≥ mucho y lo devolv√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone work very well, accept the battery life was very low 86%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llevo ya una semana con el tel√©fono, es el primero de la marca que utilizo, no le pude encontrar ni un solo detalle m√°s que la bater√≠a que ven√≠a al 91% (lo cual se me hace muy bueno por el precio que pagas) el tel√©fono est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo y por la gran rebaja de precio que recibe me atrevo a decir que casi vale m√°s la pena comprarlo rem√©sese"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A decir verdad el iPhone lleg√≥ en un excelente estado, ven√≠a s√∫per cuidado y solo con algunos y muy ligeros rayones, la bater√≠a me sorprendi√≥ mucho ya que viene con 87%, todo funciona incre√≠ble bocinas, sensores etc etc, el cargador es uno gen√©rico eso si pero en mi caso me lleg√≥ en un excelente estado !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pues solo el precio que se me dijo que val√≠a 11 y fracci√≥n y al final fuero arriba de 13 y a√∫n as√≠ decid√≠ comprarlo mal sabor de boca pero estuvo bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La caja en donde viene no es la mejor, √©l tel√©fono viene con algunos rayones c√≥mo se especifica pero funciona bien, aceptable."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I received the iPhone 11 Pro on April 1st, 2021, everything seemed fine! I am a boater and use my phone for navigation, I have been using iPhones for this for over 8 years with no issues. I also use various mapping apps for driving and general navigation. The iPhone 11 Pro I purchased nearly got me in serious trouble - the antenna on the phone was broken... meaning the GPS does not work outside of cell service (I live in a rural place so that is huge). These issues put me and my boat in major danger, the GPS kept telling me I was not where I was.I took the iPhone 11 Pro to the Apple store, after $56 they were able to tell me the phone antenna was broken and was sold broken to me. This was very disappointing and frankly dangerous. The Apple Store quoted me $880 to repair the antenna.The company was responsive but did not offer to pay for the repair or provide me with a replacement. I was offered a refund by Amazon. This is ok but i really just want a phone that works (as per their advertisement)."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Battery life"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me llego con rayones en las esquinas y la pantalla pero nada que afecte en cuanto a bater√≠a me llego con un 90 y con 5 cargas esta en 88 pero espero haya sido por las actualizaciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas pero para mi sorpresa el tel√©fono lleg√≥ con el 100% de condici√≥n en la bater√≠a. Est√©ticamente muy cuidado y todos le funciona perfectamente. Da la impresi√≥n de ser un tel√©fono completamente nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©ticamente se merece un 10, me gust√≥ mucho fue muy f√°cil de configurar, la bater√≠a venia con 93% de capacidad de uso, lo √∫nico que me comenz√≥ a llamar la atenci√≥n fue la pantalla, (estaba consciente al ser un producto ‚ÄúRenewed‚Äù podr√≠a tener detalles) la pantalla supongo fue remplazada pero su calidad era muy baja para mi vista fue un poco dif√≠cil y cansado, me gusto mucho la compra el tiempo de env√≠o, volver√© a intentar comprar un renewal pero ojal√° que ya no venga con este detalle. Previamente tome el n√∫mero de serie para cuando llegue el nuevo no tenga problemas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overall the phone I received was fine. There were several cosmetic issues with the phone that I received.- There was a (albeit thin) 1.5 cm scratch on the screen, underneath the screen protector which was unfortunate- There were several fine scratches on the cameras on the back. Photo capability seems unchanged.- Battery health was pretty good at 95%The provided charger is unfortunately 5V/2.3a and therefore will not fast charge your phone. It would have been nice to see an 18 or 20 W charger included.Overall it‚Äôs fine for the price I paid."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ con unos detalles est√©ticos muy m√≠nimos, no afecta su uso. Para el precio que tiene est√° s√∫per bien. Lleg√≥ a tiempo, el rendimiento de la bater√≠a est√° excelente, ya llevo casi dos meses con el."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El sistema al manipularlo funciona normal, sin embargo el bot√≥n de encendido est√° un poco flojo, el marco del celular se ve de un material ajeno al del iPhone (se ve y se siente muy corriente).La bater√≠a es baja, si bien en todas la rese√±as se menciona que llegan de 95%.En la pantalla hay una mancha que no es removible (se aprecia en la foto de la bater√≠a, est√° a la derecha de la √∫ltima palabra ‚Äúusarlo‚Äù)Los accesorios se ven de muy mala calidad tambi√©n."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ en el tiempo indicado, no tiene detalles , muy buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buen equipo llego en perfectas condiciones y el equipo est√° como nuevo, y con el 88% de porcentaje de bater√≠a, al principio ten√≠a miedo y dudas sobre comprar reacondicionados pero realmente valen mucho la pena. Creo que lo volver√≠a a comprar"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono parece que funciona bien, tengo mis dudas respecto al uso en modo de datos. Fisicamente parec√≠a estar bien hasta que le quit√© la mica, ten√≠a la pantalla muy maltratada (con la mica no se logra ver) incluso hasta el ras de la c√°mara frontal tiene ligeros rayones, la bater√≠a testaba en un 83% en mi experiencia no volver√≠a a comprar celulares renovados"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cumple con todas las expectativas, ten√≠a mis dudas pero la verdad lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo excelente, llevo con el 1 mes, la pila, el sistema todo bien, llego antes de tiempo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded.
 La verdad es que el producto lleg√≥ mucho mejor de lo que esperaba, seg√∫n las especificaciones que te indican de un producto reacondicionado. Por ejemplo, me lleg√≥ con un 95% de bater√≠a, lo cual esta muy bien, llevo aproximadamente 3 semanas us√°ndolo y no me ha presentado ning√∫n problema. Si llego con algunos ligeros detalles est√©ticos, pero claramente en la descripci√≥n dice que puede venir con ellos, adem√°s de que no van a ser percibidos a un brazo de distancia, lo cual en ml caso fue cierto, le agregue una mica de cristal y ya no se nota el ray√≥n. As√≠ que si, desde mi perspectiva todo bien, y de acuerdo a su descripci√≥n. Pd. Adem√°s es muy bonito üëÄ‚ù£Ô∏è"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Vengo del iPhone X y este es tal cual se describe, viene con una leyenda en la pila que podr√≠a ser inferior, pero viene al 100%, al ser un producto refurbished es bastante bueno. No tuvo rayones ni nada raro. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ antes, no ten√≠a ning√∫n ray√≥n y funciona a la perfecci√≥n. La bater√≠a est√° pr√°cticamente al 100% y tra√≠a cable original. Creo que tuve suerte porque se ve nuevo ü§© ya tengo dos semanas con el y sin problemas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estoy muy complacido con mi producto. Me llego en excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hasta ahora no puedo calificar la durabilidad porque me acaba de llegar (rea condicionado), pero me lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones, si no fuera por la bater√≠a que tiene condici√≥n (85) podr√≠a pasar como producto ‚Äúnuevo‚Äù. Me lleg√≥ sin ning√∫n rasgu√±o, perfectas condiciones est√©ticas y por lo que pagu√© estoy muy contento."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me anim√© a comprarlo despu√©s de ver varios videos de Amazon renovado y la verdad estoy muy contento en mi primer d√≠a, todo funciona la est√©tica es impecable y el porcentaje de bater√≠a viene arriba de 90, los accesorios no son problema porque especifica que no son originales pero funcionan a la perfecci√≥n, seria cosa de ver como me sigue funcionando en 1 semana 1 mes etc"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En realidad ten√≠a miedo acerca de c√≥mo iba a llegar el producto ya que el precio me pareci√≥ bastante atractivo, tengo que decir que estoy completamente sorprendida ya que el equipo llego sin un solo rasgu√±o, estetica completamente al 100%, la caja si era gen√©rica y el cargador tambi√©n pero completamente funcionales y correos den a lo pagado por el equipo, definitivamente lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me encanto el celular en general, no tiene ralladuras ni raspones, llego con 84% de bater√≠a, lo cual es aceptable para ser reacondicionado, el celular funciona excelente, como nuevo, las c√°maras tambi√©n, el √∫nico detalle es que tiene un poco despegada la pantalla en la parte de arriba, pero nada que realmente pueda afectarle al celular, venia envuelto en burbujas y con un cargador gen√©rico."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Qu√© me gusto: llevo tiempo us√°ndolo y hasta ahora el funcionamiento es s√∫per √≥ptimo. La bater√≠a tiene buen funcionamiento en comparaci√≥n de otro nuevo que tengo.
Qu√© no me gust√≥: Sobre sale un poco la pantalla, pero es imperceptible en el uso, otro detalle es que en la informaci√≥n del tel√©fono indica que la bater√≠a no es un Producto original."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","De momento llevo una semana prob√°ndolo y todo correcto, desde la est√©tica hasta el software, eso s√≠ en cargador es gen√©rico y no lo prob√© ten√≠a originales."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Aunque lleg√≥ con poca pila, fue a mi apple m√°s cercana a aplicar el seguro.
No me cobraron nada y ahora tengo un 11 pro nuevo!
Es cuesti√≥n de suerte pero por 11,099.00 nada mal. Pienso que es una gran opci√≥n es siempre y cuando no sea muy necesario y urgente el tel√©fono, ya que sino te gusta lo puedes devolver. En mi caso lo compr√© por un cupon de 999.00 que me regalo amazon"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Al principio ten√≠a dudas acerca del tel√©fono porque hab√≠a visto en varios post sobre que a veces llegaban fallados, con la bater√≠a muy desgastada o golpes. Pero en mi caso tuve suerte, el tel√©fono me lleg√≥ con 98% de bater√≠a y con dos peque√±os ara√±azos en la pantalla que no afectan el funcionamiento del producto. El paquete lleg√≥ como indican en la descripci√≥n, una caja gen√©rica y un cargador de dudosa calidad, pero funciona. Lo primero que hice despu√©s de configurarlo fue revisarlo con el programa 3utools para saber si alguna pieza hab√≠a sido cambiada pero no, todo estaba como nuevo y me siento muy a gusto con mi compra y les quiero recordar algo que le√≠ mucho ‚ÄúEs un volado‚Äù puede ser que te toque un equipo casi nuevo como el m√≠o o que te toque uno con m√°s tiempo de uso y/o imperfecciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad todo bien desde el precio pagado hasta la calidad del equipo, llego en perfectas condiciones. Ya llevo unos meses de uso y todo marcha bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Reacondicionado super√≥ mis espectativas. El tel√©fono pr√°cticamente est√° como nuevo. La bater√≠a me lleg√≥ con un 84% de vida √∫til. Est√©ticamente y en funcionamiento le dar√≠a un 10 de 10. Te lo env√≠an con un cable certificado y un cargador certificado aunque ambos no sean originales. Yo soy de los que guardan la caja. Pero estos no vienen con una caja original sino gen√©rica. Dicho eso estoy muy feliz con mi compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bonito y todo pero me llego de 89% de pila cuando la aplicaci√≥n claramente dice mas de 90üëéüèº"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica de 9.5, bater√≠a en 96%, trae una mica de cristal frontal instalada, actualmente funciona sin ning√∫n inconveniente, env√≠o r√°pido.
Actualizare si tengo alguna falla.
De momento la mejor relaci√≥n calidad y precio."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me acaba de llegar el iphone. Est√©ticamente est√° bien, el problema fue que al meterme a configuraci√≥n para ver el estado de la bater√≠a me sale el mensaje de error de que la pieza no es original, est√° mal instalada o no funciona bien. Lo mismo con la pantalla.
Veo que a otros compradores s√≠ les aparece el porcentaje de bater√≠a, por lo que no me quiero arriesgar y usarlo as√≠ sin los est√°ndares de calidad que hab√≠an prometido al comprarlo.

Como no cumple con los est√°ndares que promete el vendedor, estoy iniciando la devoluci√≥n, es una pena porque realmente quer√≠a este celular."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone was visibly damaged in multiple places out of the box. Disappointing."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono llego con una est√©tica de 9, por el precio fue una muy buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo tiene est√©tica de 9.5, solo que el equipo que ha mi me toco tra√≠a la bater√≠a de 80% lo cual ya era problema de uso para lo que se ocupaba, al igual que tenia sobre calentamiento al realizar alguna actividad (juegos en especifico)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone solo llegaba al 80% porciento de bater√≠a y se calentaba mucho al grabar o tomar fotos, se descargaba muy r√°pido creo no me toc√≥ buena suerte."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Phone is ok but the battery life is bad 80 percent life"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Le doy una calificaci√≥n de 7 de 10, presenta algunos rayones en pantalla, los bordes y en una de las camaras traseras. No afecta al funcionamiento pero si se nota que es usado.
Tard√≥ mucho en cargar al principio y se calent√≥, probablemente debe ser por el cargador gen√©rico, ya lo cambie y espero que no me de problemas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","el Iphone venia tal cual como lo describe buena compra para el precio"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo ven√≠a sin ning√∫n da√±o, solo podr√≠a decir que el detalle que encontr√© fue que la bater√≠a es del 82% entiendo que mencionan que es m√≠nimo de 80%, pero en funcionalidad se encuentra al 100, volver√≠a a comprar sin problema ‚Äú."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Qued√© realmente sorprendido!! :D El tel√©fono lleg√≥ con 91% en la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a y con una mica ya instalada, no tiene ni un solo ray√≥n, ni un solo golpe.

Llego con 100% de condicion de bateria, pero hasta ahora ha bajado al 94% no he tenido Iphone anteriormente si que no se muy bien que tan preocupante podria ser. Detalles en los lados de uso, pero pantalla y parte posterior al 10000%

El √∫nico detalle, que ha tenido es que el cargador dejo de funcionar a los dos meses. As√≠ que tengan en consideraci√≥n comprar uno de la marca. De ahi en fuera, no vino con caja ni cargador original, ni mica como muchos decian, pero eso ultimo es lo de menos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","shipping was taking sometime, here may be over a week, arrived in generic box with headphone only, the phone it self had noticeable scratches on screen, the body and the back looked like new, battery health was almost new, it was on discount and decided to keep it since I will put screen shield and those scratches will be invisible.keep in mind (Renewed doesn't mean phone will be flawless)
it has been a month now and phone performing as expected.
removed 2 starts for shipping delay and screen scratches"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","No me gusto el estado de la bateria,me llego un equipo con 87 de bateria, lo utilice por una semana pero el equipo se calentaba y ademas el parlante estaba descompuesto, lo compare con otro iphone 11 y funcionaba genial a comparacion de este, tal vez solo tuve mala suerte ya que en un principio habia escuchado buenas rese√±as de los equipos y por eso me anime a comprarlo, pero como repito tuve mala suerte con este celular.
Tambien tenia una astilladura en el marco de la camara, no me importo mucho realemente pero me decepciono con el parlante."

I had no problem setting it up, and the phone is in great physical condition! Amazing, and great value for the money you pay!"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a un poco de dudas, pero la verdad el tel√©fono que recib√≠ est√° en perfectas condiciones, ning√∫n rasgu√±o en la pantalla, solo un peque√±o rasp√≥n atr√°s (que con carcasa queda completamente desaparecido) micr√≥fono, bocinas, sensibilidad, c√°mara, todo al 100. La bater√≠a est√° en 85 de vida, pero rinde al m√°ximo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone de lejos no se ve mal, sin embargo tiene detalles como la parte del cromado que parece que lo haya pintado con esmalte de u√±as. Ten√≠a esperanza por las opiniones que hab√≠a en el art√≠culo pero para mi gusto no vale la pena el precio, prefiero devolverlo por uno nuevo. La bater√≠a vino en 84% y tiene un ray√≥n en la pantalla pero como le ponen un protector de pantalla para que no se vea. Si no les molesta la est√©tica est√° bien por el precio. Su funcionalidad es de 100%."

 El iPhone esta impecable no tiene rayones ni abolladuras, el tema es el audio, la bocina superior esta da√±ada, cuando haces llamadas no se les entiende bien a las personas, y si lo pones en reproducci√≥n de musica se oye como est√©reo viejo, solo sirve la bocina inferior, y la bater√≠a me vino al ras de lo prometido 81%"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hasta ahorita se me ha trabado poco
Llego con 93% de bater√≠a, as√≠ que creo que es un poco alto el costo con relaci√≥n a la calidad, espero no me falle en el futuro"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Not only what I expected but better. Not at arm‚Äôs length but close up perfect, and battery well over 80%, in fact I think 93% at least.
Seller even got back to me to see if I was happy and anything they could do to help.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Equipo en super buen estado sin ralladuras ni nada por el estilo est√©tica de 100 lo super recomiendo"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone funciona muy bien, me lleg√≥ con un 86% de bater√≠a, hubiera esperado que fuera m√°s pero lo que no me gust√≥ es que viene con un ray√≥n muy profundo, digo ya prendido el iPhone no afecta la visibilidad, pero si le pasas el dedo si se siente el ray√≥n, y no, no est√° sobre la mica, le quit√© la mica pensando que estaba en la mica, y me di cuenta que estaba sobre el cristal.
Fuera de eso funciona bien y no tiene ning√∫n otro golpe o Ray√≥n sobre la carcasa."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a muchas dudas, pero vali√≥ la pena. Est√©tica de 10 y funciona perfectamente. La bater√≠a me lleg√≥ al 100%."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hola buenas noches adquirir un iPhone 11 pro pero ya le puse un chip att& y me aparece error en llamada me podr√≠an ayudar"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pues el equipo me lleg√≥ r√°pido, solo que venia muy desgastado de la pila y la pantalla con muchos rayones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","De momento parece como nuevo, ya revise audio, wifi, bluetooth, tarjeta del chip sin problemas, bater√≠a con 93% de vida, a ver como funciona estos d√≠as."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No duden en comprarlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No le pongo 4 estrellas solamente porque pudieran mejorar la calidad el cargador con el que viene, por lo dem√°s, tanto calidad, envoltura, funcionamiento y est√©tica del equipo es un 10 de 10"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ha sido un buen producto, por calidad-precio hasta el momento muy bien, yo lo compr√© hace 5 meses y los √∫nicos detalles son que la pantalla a veces falla el touch y que la bater√≠a no dura mucho."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono funcionaba bien y de est√©tica estaba bien, no me gust√≥ porque ten√≠a muchos rayones profundos en la pantalla y la bater√≠a era del 86%, por lo que mejor decid√≠ devolverlo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©ticamente hab√≠a llegado con algunos golpes en el marco y rayones en la pantalla que se notaban aun con el protector que le ponen y la bocina de arriba sonaba (en un principio) algo baja, normal si consideras que es mas peque√±a. hasta ese punto son temas que al ser Renewed pueden ser comprensibles.

Pero conforme fui usando el equipo los videos se grababan con un volumen bajo como si estuvieran muy lejos, pero a los 20 o 30 segundos sonaba con volumen normal , en las llamadas en ocasiones sonaba como si estuviera muy lejos la otra persona y a veces ni siquiera se escuchaba a los 3 o 4 d√≠as ya comenz√≥ a sonar la bocina superior como si estuviera rota (como si pusieras un cart√≥n enfrente ).

decid√≠ regresarlo ya que justamente para lo que ocupo no lo iba a poder utilizar, la est√©tica era lo de menos en ese punto pero no lo iba a poder utilizar de manera correcta"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto lleg√≥ muy bien
De est√°tica ning√∫n detalle, c√°maras, FaceID, bocinas funcionando bien
Lleg√≥ con mica
Pero al quit√°rsela me percat√© que la pantalla estaba rayada, no interfiere con la visualizaci√≥n de contenido y no se aprecia al ponerle mica, pero si es considerable el da√±o en la pantalla
Lleg√≥ con una bater√≠a de 84%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es la primera vez que compro un equipo renovado y pensar√≠a que estuviera en mejores condiciones est√©ticas, en particular el equipo que me lleg√≥ ten√≠a ralladuras en todo el marco muy notorias. adicional a ello en la parte de la pantalla me llego con una mica de cristal queriendo enmascarar las ralladuras, algunas de ellas eran muy profundas y se notaban demasiado.
Por otro lado me llego un modelo que se vende en US y el cual no funciona del todo bien con la red de MX o al menos no es compatible con la red compartida en la que tengo mi plan.
Fuera de lo anterior el equipo funcionaba bien y la vida de la bater√≠a era de 92% pero mi decisi√≥n fue regresarlo ya que no cumpl√≠a con mis expectativas y tampoco me era del todo funcional."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The out of box experience isn‚Äôt great, but it‚Äôs 60% of the cost of new. Two days in, battery life is 100%, minor blemishes from what seems like a battery replacement but nothing very noticeable. Looks pretty much new, hardware works great, software works like new. Will update if there are any issues in the coming weeks."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llevo ya con el 5 meses y todo bien hasta ahora. Solo llego con un rasgu√±o en la pantalla casi imperceptible. No trae cargador ni cubo original y viene en una caja equis."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas pero la verdad llego s√∫per r√°pido y en buen estado, la bater√≠a lleg√≥ con un 91% que consider√≥ bien, el celular lleg√≥ con mica de protecci√≥n y sin ning√∫n ray√≥n casi como nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ en muy buenas condiciones, la bater√≠a al 86, est√©ticamente 9.5, funcionalidad 10, sobre los accesorios (cable y cargador) incluye lo que indica en la descripci√≥n, son gen√©ricos. Definitivamente volver√≠a a comprar uno restaurado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular lleg√≥ en muy buen estado. Sin embargo, despu√©s de 4 meses de uso empez√≥ a reiniciarse y a no reconocer la bater√≠a. En cuanto lo llev√© me dijeron que la bater√≠a estaba en perfecto estado, pero que ten√≠a un error en la placa base del celular que arrojaba el siguiente log ""panic full"", que me explicaron, es un error que con el tiempo no va a volver a prender el celular. Hasta el momento se me sigue reiniciando despu√©s de 2 horas de uso y en loops de reinicio de hasta 6 horas!!!!!!!

Chequen sus productos antes de que la garant√≠a de amazon se termine"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes de lo indicado
El tel√©fono viene intacto, sin ning√∫n rasgu√±o y con condici√≥n de bater√≠a de 96%

Ampliamente recomendable üíØ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular viene en buenas condiciones, sin embargo, tiene un uso de bater√≠a del 84% lo cual me parece muy bajo y el aud√≠fono se escucha distorsionado al reproducir audio o llamadas en altavoz. En una llamada con el celular pegado a la oreja se escucha bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto y el precio est√°n muy accesible s√∫per recomendable!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas al ser reacondicionado‚Ä¶ pero me ha servido muy bien‚Ä¶ y no ha presentado falla alguna"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Funciona muy bien todo, pila 85%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","BUENA PRESENTACION YFUNCIONAMIENTO"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica del equipo de 9.9. Trae protector en cristal delantero y trasero. El motivo de cambio de mi equipo anterior fue por la bateria. El unico ‚Äúinconveniente‚Äù de este iphone es que la capacidad m√°xima de bateria fue del 87%. Si me hubiera tocado uno con 95% habria sido perfecta la compra. NO me arrepiento."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Debo de reconocer que al principio ten√≠a mis dudas de comprar un equipo semi nuevo y m√°s por internet. Que llegar√° un libro, un Boing, etc. O que llegara s√∫per maltratado. Sin embargo, quede muy satisfecho con la compra del equipo.
El equipo lleg√≥ el d√≠a estipulado
El equipo f√≠sicamente es de 10
La bater√≠a tiene el 91%
Bocina, c√°maras, Face ID, centro de carga y botones funcionando al 100%
No se si fue cuesti√≥n de suerte o todos sus equipos que maneja este proveedor estar impecables. Sin duda alguna volver√≠a a adquirir alg√∫n otro equipo con ellos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me decid√≠ por este tipo de art√≠culo reconstruidos por su precio, que no se compara con uno nuevo. Este en particular lleg√≥ bien con lo descrito en la publicaci√≥n, a pesar que tiene un peque√±√≠simo detalle en car√°tula no tiene nada que ver con su funcionamiento. Todo lo dem√°s bien, la bater√≠a tiene mas del 80 % de capacidad y la marca te respalda su funcionamiento. Lo recomiendo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen equipo iPhone 11 Pro, aunque ven√≠a un poco rayada la pantalla, bater√≠a 92%."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono funciona a la perfecci√≥n, pero este ven√≠a con la pantalla rayada y no me percate de esto al principio porque tenia una mica puesta, al parecer le pusieron esa mica para que no se notar√°. De haberme dado cuenta antes lo hubiera regresado. Revisen muy bien los tel√©fonos que compren con este vendedor."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Like its good though but dislikes no earphone"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fue la primera vez que adquir√≠a un celular a trav√©s de Amazon Renewed y no me arrepiento. El celular llego en buenas condiciones, pr√°cticamente como nuevo. :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me est√° gustando el iPhone porque me llego muy r√°pido y apenas tiene un ray√≥n diminuto, la salud de la bater√≠a la tiene al 100% y por el momento el celular est√° trabajando bien y sin problemas, actualizo si llego a tener fallas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En relaci√≥n al precio est√° bien el equipo, s√≥lo tiene unas peque√±as raspaduras en los laterales de la pantalla, lo que no me gusta nada es que se calienta demasiado el equipo, pero en si, se podr√≠a decir que est√° bien el equipo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica de 10"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El env√≠o fue muy r√°pido, el equipo esta en terminos generales, bien, algunos rayones pero nada excesivo y opera muy bien; recomiendo al vendedor"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Se ve y funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La bater√≠a tiene un estado de 99%, est√©ticamente se ve al 98% solamente tiene detalles de uso en las esquinas de lado derecho, no esperaba tanto de un producto reacondicionado, solo llevo 1 semana con el celular, a ver qu√© tal va despu√©s"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The phone came with a screen protector! That was great to see

But the battery is not good and there's already glitches sometimes like I have to close apps sometimes or the screen freezes

Plus it easily gets hot"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me ha salvado y funciona excelente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo llego en excelente estado sin problema alguno, y todo funciona a la perfecci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Equipo con la calidad de uno nuevo, la calidad-precio es lo mejor"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cumple lo que menciona ya que vino al siguiente d√≠a de haberlo comprado; despu√©s de revisarle todo vino pr√°cticamente como un iPhone nuevo con la bater√≠a al 100%. Solamente vino con una peque√±a raya ocasionada en el notch pero que no imped√≠a las operaciones del celular y est√©ticamente casi no se nota."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","iPhone arrived in very poor condition and not as described. It had a screen protector loosely and crookedly installed, and the screen underneath had heaps of scratches - all very noticeable at arms length, despite the claim in the item description. Sides were also scuffed and camera lenses had scratches around the rim. Battery health was also abysmal at 83%, above 80 as described but nowhere near the 90+ in other reviews. Immediately returning this. Just buy from apple and save yourself the trouble. Never buying Amazon Renewed again. Very dissapointed."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","el equipo en perfectas condiciones todo trabaja correctamente"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad, ten√≠a mis dudas por tratarse de un equipo ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù, sin embargo todo result√≥ excelente, recib√≠ un tel√©fono por debajo del costo promedio y en perfectas condiciones, ni un rasgu√±o y est√©tica de 100. La funcionalidad, perfecta, como si viniera de Apple. Felicidades a Amazon por ofrecer estos productos que de otra manera ser√≠a m√°s dif√≠cil tener acceso a ellos. Esta compra es garant√≠a de servicio y calidad."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto lleg√≥ con una mica y se ve√≠an rayas en la pantalla, intente cambiar la mica para solucionar el fallo y es la pantalla la que est√° rayada, no son ligeros rasgu√±os. Amazon no debe poner que son Certificados por Amazon si no verifican la calidad ofertada"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me gust√≥ el producto en general solo que es algo peque√±o. Pero es una excelente compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo lleg√≥ con muchos detalles en la pantalla demasiados para la relaci√≥n precio calidad"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ en las condiciones que se especifican en la descripci√≥n. La bater√≠a lleg√≥ con una vida del 97%, aunque tras no muchas semanas de uno baj√≥ a 94%. Fuera de eso, el tel√©fono funciona de manera perfecta. Las c√°maras no tienen ning√∫n problema y est√©ticamente el tel√©fono est√° integro. Como el tel√©fono era importado desde Estados Unidos, sali√≥ un poco m√°s caro y fue un poco m√°s tardado que si lo hubiera comprado en M√©xico, sin embargo, personalmente esto me dio un poco m√°s de confianza."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iPhone est√° en excelente estado, casi como si fuera nuevo, ¬ølo malo?

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en buen estado, bien embalado y funciona sin problemas, solo la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a es del 81%, de all√≠ en m√°s todo esta perfecto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen equipo, buena estetica, con protector en la pantalla y buen % en la condici√≥n de bater√≠a.
Unico detalle no viene con accesorios orginales (no incluye earpods) y en este caso no es cargador de carga rapida."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Dudaba de la seguridad de la compra, sin embargo el celular llego en tiempo y forma, el estado del equipo es como si fuera nuevo. Realmente estoy sorprendido, llego con un cargador gen√©rico y una mica incluida, el estado de la bateria no es el mejor pero sin duda es lo que esperas por el precio, sin duda alguna fue una buena compra."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","De est√©tica le doy un 9.5 por que la pantalla venia con un ligero ray√≥n pero de ah√≠ en fuera todo correcto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tel√©fono en excelentes condiciones. El funcionamiento no tiene queja alguna"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo llego en excelentes condiciones ni un solo detalle y la salud de la bateria al 100 sin duda no me arrepiento de confiar en amazon renewed premium."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo f√≠sicamente estaba en buenas condiciones salvo un ligero rasp√≥n que ten√≠a en el marco superior, lo malo fue que ten√≠a la bocina inferior reventada y la bater√≠a en muy baja condici√≥n de pila. Todo lo dem√°s bien."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo genial esta nuevo literalmente me llego con 98% de bater√≠a y supero mis expectativas"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The iphone was good was good but would not work on Canadian Telecoms. I returned it."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No funciona correctamente, El conector no sirve y no lo puedo cargar. He enviado un correo al proveedor para solicitar el reemplazo o devoluci√≥n y nadie me responde.
Los 90 d√≠as de garant√≠a que ofrece el proveedor al parecer es una mentira.
Los 30 d√≠as que ofrece Amazon ya pasaron y no lo puedo regresar con ellos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El telefono hasta el momento llego bien,llego a los 2 dias de que lo ped√≠, llego con un 90% de visual, la pantalla un poco con rayaduras, pero son minimas, muy buena bateria. Hasta el momento todo bien üëçüèΩ"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estoy muy decepcionado de la compra, el equipo presenta rayones profundos en la pantalla, la bocina frontal est√° sucia y no funciona correctamente, no volver√≠a a comprar renewed con los criterios que maneja Amazon mexico"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Mi iPhone 11 Pro lleg√≥ en perfecto estado (con detalles est√©ticos muy m√≠nimos que a simple vista ni siquiera se ven) y con bater√≠a de casi 90% de vida. A 6 meses de haberlo comprado sigue funcionando perfectamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente art√≠culo, era de esperarse que vendr√≠a con detalles y si, el detalle fue un peque√±o rasgu√±o en el borde, pero la bater√≠a al 100% y cero fallos, lo recomiendo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo funciona bien, es un excelente producto debido a la calidad y al precio, llego con 100% de salud de bater√≠a y no me ha dado ninguna falla, recomendado!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen producto, funciona como si fuera nuevo, la pantalla tiene el true tone y verificando con el 3utools no le han reemplazado piezas, por eso la bater√≠a al 84% que a√∫n as√≠ me dura todo el d√≠a sin problemas, no se calienta y corre super bien todas las aplicaciones, el √∫nico detalle es un rasgu√±o en la pantalla pero es imperceptible"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es bastante √∫til, casi como nuevo, solo se apaga la pantalla muy de vez en cuando pero prende el sistema en segundos (supongo que por eso lo regresaron) relaci√≥n precio calidad bastante Bueno! Volver√≠a a comprar uno as√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No fue lo que esperaba, lleg√≥ incompleto sin cable ni cargador üòû"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lleg√≥ en el d√≠a indicado.
F√≠sicamente. El tel√©fono lleg√≥ muy bien empacado, ven√≠a con un cargador y cable gen√©rico pero con certificado de calidad, y est√©ticamente al 100%, tambi√©n tra√≠a su mica de cristal.
Funcionalidad. Hasta ahora toda va excelente, la bater√≠a con 100% de desempe√±o y para el uso que yo le doy me dura dos d√≠as completos, literas dos d√≠as con sus dos noches, as√≠ que si lo recomiendo. Gracias!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo iba bien. A los 4 meses dejo de funcionar: se apag√≥ de la nada y nunca volvi√≥ a prender. Nunca m√°s comprare los reacondicionados de Amazon. A ese precio me sale m√°s barato un nuevo que me durar√° unos a√±os y no unos meses."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono tiene da√±o visible no lo he usado esperar√≠a que funcione bien. Est√©ticamente le doy 5 no es posible que no lo env√≠en ni con cargador."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy buen equipo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono lleg√≥
Como nuevo sin detalles de uso y sin ning√∫n rasgu√±o, lo √∫nico malo fueron la caja y los accesorios no originales, es una muy buena compra por el precio y vale la pena"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Funciono bien el primer mes, al momento me est√° causando problemas con el touch, no cierra aplicaciones, no me deja bajar y subir brillo y volumen, la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a bajo 5% en cuesti√≥n de 1 mes de uso, me gustar√≠a saber que aplica en este caso. Saludos."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√° es una de las mejores compras que he hecho, el celular est√° pr√°cticamente nuevo, no tiene ning√∫n detalle f√≠sico y a√∫n cuenta con su Mica y tiene el 100% de bater√≠a, sin bien como de menciona los accesorios son gen√©ricos al igual que la caja para m√≠ no fue inconveniente, el precio est√° por menos de la mitad que uno nuevo, asi que si tienes la oportunidad y el dinero es una muy buena opci√≥n."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Note que el celular se encontraba algo sucio, al principio pens√© que eran rayones pero tras limpiarlo qued√≥ muy bien.

Solamente unos rayones muy peque√±os en la pantalla,m√≠nimos.

Bater√≠a con el 98% de vida √∫til y cargador y cable de corriente gen√©ricos como indicado

Peque√±os detalles que hacen que la primera impresi√≥n al abrirlo no sea tan placentera, m√°s a√∫n entiendo que no es un equipo %100 nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente producto como nuevo, ya tengo desde marzo us√°ndolo y no me a fallado ni un poco, todo perfecto el cargador gen√©rico que incluye esta excelente carga s√∫per r√°pido al 100 mi equipo. Ni un solo rasgu√±o equipo impecable. A pesar de ser re acondicionado funciona perfectamente. Ya hab√≠a comprado uno desde diciembre 2020 y a√∫n sigue funcionando perfectamente."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Por el precio era de esperarse que el producto viniera con detalles, la pantalla viene intacta, la bater√≠a al 93%, y si tiene detalles est√©ticos que son de esperarse."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llevo ya varias semanas de uso y esta excelente, se ve casi como nuevo, es una excelente opci√≥n si est√°s buscando cambiar de equipo!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo en buenas condiciones en general, solo con algunos marcas o rayaduras en la pantalla, no entregan accesorios originales, el cargador no cumpl√≠a con el Voltios y Amperes que un cargador original requiere."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Debo aceptar que compr√© con miedo el cel. Pero despu√©s de ver videos y rese√±as me anim√© y debo confesar que es una de las mejores compras que he realizado. Funciona a la perfecci√≥n, s√≥lo ten√≠a un par de raspones m√≠nimos qu√© ni se notan. Por el precio 100% recomendado"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular vino en perfecto estado? bateria al 98% de su capacidad. el unico detalle es que viene en una caja cualquiera y con un cargador fake pero que igual funciona. Por el estaso del celular 10/10, venia con mica"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Does not come in original Apple iPhone casing but it works and looks like brand new.No scratches, battery life is good.Overall recommend."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En verdad es una excelente opcion precio/calidad, lo recomiendo ampliamente, puedes comprar con seguridad, de impuestos me regresaron 13 USD, fenomenal. Llego a Mexico super rapido."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","No me gusto, porque est√©ticamente se ve√≠a muy deteriorado respecto al precio aparte de la vida de la bater√≠a muy degradada en 80%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La bateria esta en perfecto estado, y en general ni siquiera parece renovado esta como nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estoy fascinada con el s√∫per buena compra la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a ven√≠a en 94% lo cual me parece excelente, solo tuve un problema con la pantalla que al quitar la mica que ya viene incluida la pantalla esta muy rayada, pero al colocar mica de cristal como si nada!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","S√∫per bien el equipo, bastante satisfecho üëå"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Producto como nuevo, con un 85% de bater√≠a , no viene con caja original ni cargador ni accesorios"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo ven√≠a en excelentes condiciones , quiz√° alguna raya o rasp√≥n pero casi imperceptibles"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tengan cuidado y chequen el numero del modelo, pues en mi cas recientemenete me di cuenta que no es compatible con la banda 28 en M√©xico"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Muy bien tel√©fono"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente estado del tel√©fono, funciona de maravilla y fue un buen upgrade del 7 que ten√≠a a este. El hecho de ser ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù no ha afectado en nada por lo que lo recomiendo ampliamente, la bater√≠a del m√≠o llego al 100% que era lo que m√°s me preocupaba y la est√©tica no ten√≠a ni un solo detalle"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto llego en mal estado ya que la pantalla venia con un rayon muy profundo , hasta parece estrellado, la bocina de llamadas se escucha ronca y con ruido y el embalaje queda mucho a desear, la bateria tenia un 82% y se calento al cargarlo ya que llego con un 10%"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","P√©simo producto con muchos rayones y no parece ni cerca a estar como nuevo es un producto con mucho uso"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen producto, lastima la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Parec√≠a como nuevo sin detalle alguno y con la bater√≠a al 100% pero se me hizo raro que tuviera cristal proyector, a los 3 meses me se estrell√≥ poquito el cristal protector y al quit√°rselo para ponerle otro vi que la pantalla estaba rayada y con el cristal no se le nota nada. De darme cuenta desde el principio que estaba as√≠ de rayada lo devuelvo sin pensarlo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo parece realmente nuevo, viene con su cable y cargador gen√©rico, as√≠ como una llave. Tiene unos ligeros y no visibles rayas en la pantalla pero es de esperarse. La pila est√° al 90% de su capacidad. Creo que es una buena compra"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto lleg√≥ intacto, parece como si lo hubieran sacado de la caja de apple y lo hubieran enviado, ni un s√≥lo ray√≥n. S√≠ vino con protector de pantalla puesto, capacidad de pila al 100%, la capacidad si es la que mencionan, face ID funciona normal, env√≠o s√∫per r√°pido de 1 d√≠a y no tuve problemas para usarlo ya que si estaba 100% desbloqueado."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es primera vez que compro un celular renovado y he quedado totalmente sorprendida y satisfecha. Tengo 3 d√≠as con el y todo ha marchado correctamente, volver√© a actualizar este comentario en 3 meses de haberlo utilizado (antes de que se acabe la garant√≠a) tiene un peque√±o ray√≥n en la Parte de arriba pero nada que afecte al dispositivo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","el producto f√≠sicamente esta impecable muy bonito , funciona bien el √∫nico detalle es que descompone los cargadores y es imposible estar comprando cargadores originales cada dos semanas llevo 3 cargadores marca apple comprados directamente que se descomponen y tambien se descompuso el generico que me enviaron en 1 semana pero cre√≠ al principio que era por que no era el original los demas cargadores despues lo vi como coincidencia pero pues ya fe mucho es lo unico que duran intente ver la politica de 90 dias de garantia pero por ningun lado me aparecen no recominedo comprar por que para poder probar 30 dias es muy poco tiempo para saber que fallos tienen"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El estado de la bater√≠a es de 97%. Luce como nuevo, no tiene defectos est√©ticos, un punto muy peque√±o en una esquina y una peque√±a rayita cerca al puerto de carga. Funciona bien, c√°maras, botones, pantalla touch, bocinas, altavoces, micr√≥fonos y FaceID."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en excelente estado y empacado y hasta el momento funciona s√∫per s√∫per bien"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En general el celular ven√≠a en buen estado, con 88% de bater√≠a pero lo que no me gust√≥ es que tra√≠a unos rayones bastante profundos y que no se notaban porque tra√≠a la mica protectora pero al quit√°rsela me di cuenta de eso y mejor lo devolv√≠. Deber√≠an de dejar de enga√±ar al comprador con eso."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Fue una excelente compra, me costo el 60% de lo que tendr√≠a que haber pagado por un equipo nuevo, y las funciones hasta ahora han estado como si lo fuera. De no ser que no tiene los accesorios y caja original, podr√≠a pasar por un aparato nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","It works very well"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Esta completamente nuevo en exterior, 85% de vida de bater√≠a y cable y caja de conexi√≥n gen√©rico. Bien!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular si esta en estetica de 8.6, el unico inconveniente es la bateria, dura entre 3 horas de uso maximo, pero tomando en cuenta el precio y el precio del reemplazo es proporcional al costo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Pero tenia 84% de battery life y alrededor de 500 ciclos de carga. Lo devolv√≠"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Que parece nuevo"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a miedo de que fuera estafa pero al final vali√≥ la pena la compra. El tel√©fono es pr√°cticamente nuevo sin ning√∫n detalle est√©tico. Me llego en 2 d√≠as, solo el empaque es lo malo y que no viene en su caja original ni cargador original pero por el precio est√° bien, queda en segundo t√©rmino. Me llego con 94% de vida de bater√≠a, esta perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En cuanto est√©tica lleg√≥ Perfecto pero me lleg√≥ con una condici√≥n de 83% la cual no le tomo importancia reconociendo que es renewed, contaba con un fallo en la bosina que no se escuchaba casi nada, m√°s a parte que las c√°maras se ve√≠an poco borrosas."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Encantado con el Producto!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono viene en un caja gen√©rica , con cargador y cable gen√©rico , est√° en excelentes condiciones , lo que ves es lo que recibes dec√≠a que podr√≠a tener alg√∫n defecto f√≠sico pero en mi caso no fue as√≠, sirve al cien yo solo si recomiendo que le compren los accesorios originales. Estoy feliz"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cuando reci√©n abr√≠ el producto se ve√≠a en perfectas condiciones. Ni un solo rasgu√±o. Mi primer duda fue al encenderlo. No funcion√≥ el bot√≥n de encendido. Despu√©s de encenderlo al conectarlo con el cable de luz inicie el proceso de configuraci√≥n. El celular constantemente se bloqueaba y se escuchaba el sonido t√≠pico de bloqueo de los iPhone. Era imposible usar el m√≥vil as√≠, sin embargo despu√©s de un tiempo logr√© configurarlo. Intent√© actualizarlo a la versi√≥n iOS 14.3 (la √∫ltima a este d√≠a) con la esperanza de que esto solucionara el problema, sin embargo, al estarse instalando se apag√≥ el m√≥vil (pienso que por el falso que ten√≠a el bot√≥n lateral) y al apagarse al actualizarse el firmware qued√≥ inservible y no funcion√≥ m√°s, solo encendiendo en modo recuperaci√≥n. Intent√© actualizarlo y recuperarlo desde iTunes, sin embargo, me marcaba error una y otra vez y lamentablemente, despu√©s de varios intentos, tuve que devolverlo. Por lo visto fue una falla del Hardware que no ‚Äúreacondicionaron‚Äù al sacarlo a la venta. He le√≠do rese√±as muy buenas y otras nada buenas sobre los celulares reacondicionados y creo que es cuesti√≥n de suerte, por eso es que ya hice la orden de otro celular en espera de la devoluci√≥n de este."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular me llego con la pila Justo al 80%,Dije no esta mal pero al momento de cargarlo se calentaba demasiado dije bueno lo dejo pasar pero cuando puse mi chip/si card no hagarronpobre con otras y menos, lo regrese."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tenia mis dudas de que el tel√©fono llegara en buen estado sin detalles est√©ticos ni operativos pero me llev√© una agradable sorpresa al recibirlo sin ning√∫n da√±o est√©tico, operando sin problemas y con su bater√≠a al 99% de vida, Seminuevo como Nuevo. Adem√°s que me llego dos d√≠as antes de lo programado. Satisfacci√≥n Total."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Est√©tica 10/10, ni un rasgu√±o, en perfectas condiciones. Lo escane√© en 3utools y todo es original, m√°s de 300 cargas con 93% de bater√≠a. Lleg√≥ con 95%, pero baj√≥ despu√©s de la configuraci√≥n. Est√° un poco lento el desplazamiento en pantalla, pero ser√° cuesti√≥n de usarlo m√°s para ver si es alguna falla"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me gusta que la est√©tica de lo que compro a√∫n cuando es usado este al 10 de 10 aqu√≠ como lo compro por medio de Amazon pues no lo puedo ver f√≠sicamente, El √∫nico detalle que tiene que le veo ese es dos laterales vienen maltratados de ah√≠ en fuera todo bien!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones, parec√≠a nuevo, funciona al 100% y la bater√≠a esta casi al 100, con un 85%. Lo compr√© hace varios meses y no he tenido ning√∫n problema. S√∫per contenta con mi compra!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cuando compras un equipo reparado se corre el riesgo de que salgan defectos. En este caso es una pena en el caso de las llamadas. Si estoy en una, se corta sin aviso previo. Dos segundos despu√©s entra otra llamada que hace se corte la anterior."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Tengo ya 3 meses de uso m√°s o menos y todo ha sido excelente, desde que me lo dieron ven√≠a con el 100% de vida de la bater√≠a y protector de pantalla, obvio viene en otra caja y con otro cargador pero es lo de menos, la mejor compra !!!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en excelente condici√≥n y con 96% de bater√≠a, est√©ticamente luce como nuevo, muy cuidado, lleg√≥ con mica de cristal, el √∫nico detalle fue que no lleg√≥ en caja original y el cargador es gen√©rico."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono viene como nuevo, solo le encontr√© un peque√±o ray√≥n y nada m√°s, lo he estado utilizando sin fallas o problema alguno, esperaba q la pila tuviera cierto desgaste y al revisar el rendimiento la encontr√© al 100, el cargador no original, es lo q no me gusto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Buen estado general solo microrayones que se ven poni√©ndole mucha atenci√≥n. No me gusto que a la semana les hicieron un muy buen descuento."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en perfectas condiciones, estaba un poco nervioso con respecto a c√≥mo llegar√≠a el equipo, pero pr√°cticamente llego c√≥mo nuevo, ning√∫n solo ray√≥n, la bater√≠a al 100% de su capacidad. Adem√°s lleg√≥ con una mica de cristal puesta. De no ser porque viene en una caja gen√©rica con accesorios gen√©ricos creer√≠a que es totalmente nuevo. Ya no cuenta con garant√≠a limitada de Apple, pero con la garant√≠a de Amazon est√° perfecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","De lo mejor!! El equipo como nuevo pi√±a al 97% y sin desgaste en general.S√≥lo el cargador es de baja calidad por que el cable que incluyen es bueno.En general una muy buena compra; Esperar√© a tener m√°s tiempo de uso con el para dar m√°s detalles."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono te lo entregan con una mica ya puesta y se le ve como un pegamento no le tome importancia al principio, la sorpresa viene al retirarla la pantalla esta s√∫per rayada entiendo que sean productos renewed pero es un exceso el da√±o en la pantalla se le ven los ratones de uso normal pero adem√°s de eso trae varios rayones ya pronunciados en pantalla hasta parece cuarteadura"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Poco rendimiento en la bater√≠a"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular por fuera OK. Ya cuando lo configur√© resulta que la bater√≠a tiene un 77% dd capacidad cuando seg√∫n Amazon este celular deber√≠a tener arriba del 80%. Ya el mismo celular me manda aviso que la bater√≠a est√° muy degradada y debe d√°rsele mantenimiento porque se encuentra muy degradada seg√∫n el mismo iPhone. Se supone que Amazon lo debi√≥ revisar antes pero no fue as√≠. Lo regresar√© de inmediato y ya no comprar√© m√°s productos renewed, mejor a juntar dinero y comprarme uno nuevo. Ya estoy cansado de darle muchas oportunidades a los celulares re acondicionados de Amazon, tirola toalla."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas al comprar un celular reacondicionado, pero el que he comprado a llegado como NUEVO! la bater√≠a esta al 100%, no tiene ningun detalle (m√°s que un peque√±ito rasgu√±o en la pantalla) que con un buen protector no se aprecia. El telefono viene completamente liberado y trae un cargador generico y cable. Estoy muy feliz de mi compra y del dinero que me he ahorrado! (adem√°s de contriibuir al ambiente)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El articulo llego tal cual se prometio, ahora solo espero que dure bien a largo plazo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llego en perfecto estado, bater√≠a al 100%, me preocupaba que llegara da√±ado o alg√∫n problema est√©tico pero no, la verdad es que me sorprendi√≥"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones. Realmente cumple con todas las expectativas, la bater√≠a en condici√≥n del 100% y sin ning√∫n detalle."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad tuve mis dudas al realizar mi compra pero al final todo sali√≥ bien, el equipo llego a tiempo y condiciones que no me lo imaginaba, lo recomiendo al 100% a mi experiencia."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","UNA ABSOLUTA VERG√úENZA QUE AMAZON DIGA QUE ESTOS TEL√âFONOS REFABRICADOS FUERON REVISADOS Y TESTEADOS POR ‚ÄúEXPERTOS‚Äù PARA LUCIR Y FUNCIONAR COMO NUEVOS.El tel√©fono que me llego no Se quedaba sin se√±al de manera Intermitente, haci√©ndolo pr√°cticamente inservible. Adem√°s se calentaba desproporcionadamente. Estando en reposo llegaba a temperaturas como si estuvieras jugado. Me imagino que ambos problemas est√°n relacionados y radican en la placa madre del tel√©fono. Absoluta verg√ºenza."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El empaque al ser gen√©rico me dio un poco de desconfianza pero el tel√©fono lleg√≥ en excelentes condiciones, est√©tica al 100, revis√© en un programa las partes del tel√©fono y todo de f√°brica, no a fallado hasta el momento.. lo recomiendo por el precio y los meses sin intereses"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono esta en muy buenas condiciones, de est√©tica le doy un 10, la vida de la bater√≠a esta al 100%, sin duda estoy muy satisfecho de esta compra, los accesorios no son originales pero funcionan muy bien, pero en la publicaci√≥n te lo indican, la caja es gen√©rica y en conclusi√≥n el tel√©fono esta divino y a un super precioüëçüëèüëèüëè"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono llego con demaciados rayones y golpes en los bordes y adem√°s la bocina sonaba muy mal, lastima lo tuve que regresar"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El iphone viene en perfecto estado. Yo crei que podia venir algun desperfecto, pero no fue asi.Viene con un cable y un cubo para cargar (no son originales) pero cumplen perfectamente su funci√≥n.Viene incluso con una malla protectora para la parte de enfrente.Yo tenia un iphone y no me costo NADA de trabajo pasar mi informacion de un telefono a otro.Viene totalmente desbloqueado.Buena compra!! :)"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lamentablemente tuve 2 problemas pero el principal es que al abrirlo venia una bateria de steren y y unos audifonos de baja calidad que ademas estaban rotos"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El celular me llego s√∫per r√°pido, vienen en caja gen√©rica. Es producto original, de est√©tica le doy 10 y bater√≠a 10. Ya tengo 5 meses us√°ndolo y sin ning√∫n problema la verdad."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was excited to take a chance on an amazon renewed product, however I can't say it's worth the price after all. The battery does not last long at all, and the screen itself had some deep scratches that affect what you see on-screen. The condition was fine elsewhere on the device, but I think they tried to hide the deep scratches on the screen by putting a screen protector on. To pay over $1,000 for something like this, I just don't think it's worth it at all."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","I was so surprise ! It looks brand new! Battery is at 99%. I definitely recommend this product!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","NO TIENE SE√ëAL. Despu√©s de cumplir los 3 meses de garant√≠a el tel√©fono dej√≥ de recibir se√±al hice pruebas de fallo de SIM y nada cambie a ESIM y segu√≠a sin funcionar. NO COMPREN ESTE EQUIPO Ya que la garant√≠a de los 3 meses no sirve de nada si va a dejar de funcionar al d√≠a 91."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estoy tienesl problemas con el celular como puedo hacer para devolverlo ya que me dijeron que ten√≠a una garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto vienen en las mejores condiciones pero no me gustaron las medidas y muy peque√±o y quiero cambiarlo por una versi√≥n PRO MAX...¬øEs posible hacer este cambio?"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Equipo sin se√±al, es decir no liberado para Telcel por lo menos y se calienta al cargarse"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","He comprado previamente refurbished y ha sido buena experiencia , por lo que decidi comprar nuevamente y no fue la excepcion"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Compr√© el iPhone 11 Pro y todo en perfecto estado , llego en tiempo y el √∫nico inconveniente es que por los 15k que pague la bater√≠a ven√≠a al 85% bastante gastada , aunque est√©ticamente parece nuevo ."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El aparato lleg√≥ empacado en una caja gen√©rica (como era de esperarse), con un cargador y cable tambi√©n gen√©ricos. El aspecto del aparato es impecable, no tiene ning√∫n rasgu√±o o se√±al alguna de uso previo. Ven√≠a con todo y un vidrio templado ya preinstalado.S√≥lo la instalaci√≥n de mi AppleID fue algo trabajosa, porque el aparato no ven√≠a actualizado y pidi√≥ que se actualizara a la √∫ltima versi√≥n del iOS para poder trasladar mis contenidos de mi viejo iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Lo √∫nico que no me agrad√≥ es que no son originales, el cubo y cable para cargar el tel√©fono"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto tiene PESIMO desempe√±o inal√°mbrico. Es muy dif√≠cil conectar con redes WiFi y el Bluetooth tambi√©n tiene muy mal desempe√±o. En realidad se vuelve un producto inservible. QUISIERA CAMBIARLO POR FAVOR"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Jam√°s compren reacondicionado de Amazon. En menos de 3 meses ya le tuve que cambiar la bater√≠a y a la pantalla le acaba de salir la l√≠nea verde.En fin, mi error por comprar reacondicionado y no de f√°brica."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El aparato llega con cargador y caja gen√©rica, a los pocos meses deja de funcionar el Face ID y no tiene garant√≠a para ello."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Esta incre√≠ble el equipo la verdad, esta impecable, bater√≠a al 95%, , estoy muy satisfecho, excelente servicio, con el cargador si quedan un poco mal, m√°s que nada el cubo de carga, pero vale la pena ya que como comento mi equipo est√° nuevo realmente."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Las condiciones est√©ticas del tel√©fono son incre√≠bles, en realidad podr√≠a pasar por un tel√©fono nuevo, el estado de la bater√≠a estaba al 93 lo cual era de esperarse, viene en una caja distinta y el cable y cubo para cargarlo no son originales, pero se entiende al ser Renewed.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El d√≠a s√°bado 28 de mayo recib√≠ el celular, a primera vista estaba en perfectas condiciones. Todo OK hasta el d√≠a de hoy martes 31 de mayo, cuando recib√≠ una actualizaci√≥n de IOS 15.5 y detect√≥ una falla en la pantalla y la bater√≠a, al ingresar al enlace me manda directamente a una p√°gina de sugerencias para acudir al servicio t√©cnico de APPLE, argumentando que las piezas son de menor calidad."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente celular como nuevo bateria al 100 % lo malo es que viene en caja generica y cargador generico pero el equipo impecable, seria bueno que por unos pesos mas incluyeran caja y cargador original"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Estoy sorprendido del estado, no tiene un solo rasgu√±o ni en la pantalla, ni el los bordes, por lo que he le√≠do en los dem√°s comentarios, tuve suerte. La bater√≠a funciona al 94%. Excelente!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","A pesar de no ser nuevo de paquete, est√°n en muy buen estado, vale la pena ya que vienen como nuevos y por un precio mucho menor, con respecto a la caja es gen√©rica igualmente el cargador pero insisto, por el precio y la calidad del producto vale la pena y lo recomiendo bastante."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En relaci√≥n calidad-precio es la mejor opci√≥n, el celular lleg√≥ como nuevo, por m√°s que busqu√© no encontr√© ning√∫n ray√≥n o imperfecci√≥n. Lo recomiendo 100%."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","El equipo venia impecable y con 93% de bater√≠a. El √∫nico ""defecto"" son los cargadores con los que te lo env√≠an pero vale bastante la pena ya que el equipo en cuesti√≥n de funcionamiento y est√©tica est√° al mill√≥n"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Sab√≠a que era reconstruido pero ya de iPhone s√≥lo ten√≠a la carcasa, la pantalla se ve√≠a con colores muy opacos, nada que ver con cualquier pantalla del iPhone 5 en adelante, adem√°s se trataba el sistema operativo a ratos y no funcionaba el touch correctamente, tuve que regresarlo.

"iPhone 11 Pro ","1.- La bater√≠a no dura nada la trae al 86%.2.- Viene bloqueado con USA no puedo usar mi red de telefon√≠a.3.- Se calienta a los 20 minutos de usarlo.4.- El cargador gen√©rico se sobrecalento demasiado solo lo use 1 vez.5.- No puedo hacer cambio de nada con garant√≠a porque es de Estados Unidos y aqu√≠ no vale la garant√≠a de apple.Total estafa."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me lo compr√© para mi, hasta ahora funciona perfecto, no se calienta, se carga r√°pido, venia con cargador (no de la marca) y venia en caja (no de la marca)."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Llege el color incorrecto :( Cuesta mucho por llegar incorrecto."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me encanto"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Enga√±an al comprador ocultando los defectos.No recomiendo compren este tipo de art√≠culos, siempre traen detalles, en mi caso, no me percat√© de inmediato que la pantalla ten√≠a raspones ya que el producto inclu√≠a una mica de cristal templado, cuando la sustitu√≠ me llev√© la sorpresa que la pantalla presentaba muchas imperfecciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El tel√©fono cumple con las expectativas, muy buen producto y en excelentes condiciones."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Me sorprendi√≥ bastante, el producto lleg√≥ intacto y en perfecto estado. En efecto, los accesorios son gen√©ricos, pero si ya hab√≠as tenido iPhone, esto no es un problema. Hasta hoy ha funcionado muy bien. ¬°Estoy muy contenta con mi compra!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","S√∫per buena oferta, llego como nuevo, sin rasgu√±os y da√±os"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hoy recib√≠ el celular, est√©ticamente le doy un 10/10, la condici√≥n de bater√≠a aparece con 100%. El cargador es gen√©rico (como dec√≠a en la descripci√≥n) y no trae nada m√°s. Hasta el momento todo bien, despu√©s de 2 meses les comparto qu√© tal va."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Cuando llego cre√≠ que me hab√≠an estafado ya que el empaque y la caja son de otro tipo, el tel√©fono llego en excelentes condiciones 0 rayones le dar√≠a un 10 de 10 y ten√≠a 91% de vida √∫til en la bater√≠a, le funciona todo el cargador es gen√©rico pero si le funciona."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Ten√≠a mis dudas pero llego s√∫per bien, sin ning√∫n rasgu√±o ni nada por el estilo, el m√≠o llego con 99% de bater√≠a. Llevo casi 1 mes con el y todo s√∫per bien, recomendado!"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Una maravilla, el iPhone lleg√≥ sin un rasgu√±o, la bateria al 95% y todo funcionando perfecto. practicamente nuevo."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","This device came with a random (non-apple) aftermarket display with plastic black edges. The brightness of this display cannot be adjusted more than 10% from peak, so you're stuck with near max brightness even when using it at night. The touch sensitivity is almost non-existent. It is so insensitive that it's next to impossible to type as it misses every 5th or so touch.It also has glue marks around the edges of the display and back glass.$900+ for a makeshift 64gb 11 Pro when the 13 Pro's are out is madness. This price would be too high if it came brand new in the box. Look to Marketplace or eBay."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Es la mejor compra que he realizado en Amazon. Me lleg√≥ impecable. Con bater√≠a 95"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Todo muy bien salvo que no llego en la caja de apple"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","La verdad mi experiencia fue neutra. Si la calidad de la bater√≠a estaba por encima del 80%, no es cierto que vienen ‚Äúcomo nuevos‚Äù. Me toc√≥ un equipo totalmente usado ven√≠a golpeado y con grietas en la parte trasera. Hay una gran diferencia entre un equipo renovado y un equipo de segundo uso, pero bueno el precio es aceptable para el valor original y poca depreciaci√≥n de un iPhone."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Incre√≠ble! Super√≥ mis expectativasLa bater√≠a est√° en perfecto estado y a un buen costo, me lleg√≥ al d√≠a sig a mi domicilio.Sin duda volver√≠a a comprar otroGracias üôèüèª"

Probablemente no tiene bater√≠a. Una completa estafa0/10 en general"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Solo ten√≠a un golpe en la esquina y unos ara√±asos muy muy peque√±os en la pantalla. Nada que afecte el funcionamiento. Para ser el de m√°xima capacidad fue una ganga, muy bonito y la bater√≠a al 100%."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Excelente compra aprovechando el descuento que hubo, lleg√≥ un d√≠a antes de lo esperado.Est√©tica 10/10 no tiene ni un solo detalle en la pantalla ni en los bordes ni por la parte trasera.Bater√≠a 97% de vidaAdem√°s viene con un protector de pantalla inclu√≠do üëåüèΩ"

"iPhone 11 Pro ","I have just received my iPhone 11 Pro. The first problem I know is it‚Äôs my front camera isn‚Äôt working. I bought this phone because of the camera and you guys forgot to mention that the front camera isn‚Äôt working. Battery life okay, touchscreen okay but I don‚Äôt think that I pay money for something to be missing."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El producto como nuevo una ligera mancha en el borde por donde se bloquea el celular pero es m√≠nimo, viene con un cristal en la pantalla ya integrado, la bater√≠a esta full 100% muy buena compra no tiene ning√∫n detalle es muy buena inversion"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","En la publicaci√≥n dice que viene con un m√≠nimo de 90% de vida de la bater√≠a pero me llego con el 86%. Personalmente lo regresar√© porque esperaba m√°s del celular."
"iPhone 11 Pro ","iphone en perfectas condiciones, llego con 98% vida de bateria osea literalmente como nuevo el unico detalle esta en el empaque ya que es generico y no tiene la caga ni los cargadores originales de apple"
"iPhone 11 Pro ","Hola. El d√≠a de hoy recib√≠ mi celular, esteticamente 10/10... lo que me causa conflicto es que no puedo utilizar el celular porque me pide un c√≥digo alfanum√©rico, intent√© ingresar un n√∫mero que ven√≠a pegado en la parte de atr√°s, el cu√°l cre√≠ que era el c√≥digo pero no es. No segu√≠ intentando porque el celular empez√≥ a bloquearse ya que la contrase√±a no era la correcta.Si alguien pudiera ayudarme, se lo agradecer√≠a."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Adquiri el telefono el 4 de octubre del 2020 y el 5 de noviembre ya no quiso prender y lo lleve a ishop mixep para repararlo y me dijeron que ya no habia nada que hacer que estaba inservible. Solo 3 meses me duro y ni uma vez se me cayo ni nada, no regalen su dinero comprando un cel reacondicionado les sale mucho mejor comprarlo nuevo, yo aun lo estoy pagando y ya ni sirve."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Yo esperaba por la garant√≠a de Amazon que iban a checar los celulares con algo m√°s de rigurosidad. El tel√©fono estaba en muy malas condiciones de la pantalla y ten√≠a una rayadura que era muy notoria incluso a 1 brazo de distancia, como menciona la garant√≠a. Por eso lo he devuelto, pero la experiencia de usuario con el reembolso es definitivamente deficiente :(("
"iPhone 11 Pro ","El m√≠o lleg√≥ con una est√©tica de 10, pr√°cticamente nuevo, la bater√≠a al 93%, es cuesti√≥n de suerte pero a mi me pareci√≥ una excelente compra, muy recomendable."

"iPhone 11 Pro ","Overall, product was function but for $1200+ it was just shipped in a piece of brown paper with no actual packaging and the iPhone was sliding around the box when I got it. Since it is used was expecting a bit of scratched but recieved it with 2 inch long marks on top right of screen, which was very disappointing."
