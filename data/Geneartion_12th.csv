"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro Premium thinking I had eliminated all the problems associated with buying a used phone. The ""Premium"" in the purchase was a promise of a cosmetically excellent iPhone with a one-year guarantee and a minimum battery health of 90%. Well, therein lies the rub. The exterior of the phone was excellent but upon checking the battery health I found it to be 87%. I might have been willing to accept it, but I noticed on the inspection card that all items had been checked off including the 90% battery health, but the card had not been signed or initialed. I started thinking about what else had not been checked so I boxed it up and sent it back. I'll try it again because I believe that one person doesn't make or break a company."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","When my phone arrived it was flawless, not a scratch or scuff. The phone was easy to setup and the price was well worth it."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Good"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","My first iPhone coming from a Galaxy 9+ and I‚Äôve been loving it. The battery life is great, health came in at 97% and despite me being an avid social media user, it stays charged all day. It had some tiny scratches on the sides but I didn‚Äôt mind cause it was used. I got screen protectors and a few cases and I LOVE IT."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Phone is amazing, came quickly looked like new and runs like new"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Beats buying a brand new phone considering Amazon's warranty and customer service"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Me encanta. Llego r√°pido y en la caja nuevo. Parece que lo compr√© en un lugar official."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","<3<3<3"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Great seller ! Item functions as described. Original quality iphone 12 Pro Max! Great IOS simple to navigate and use. The IOS ecosystem is good for those who prefer Apple products from ipads to Apple watch or Airpods."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","So I first had ordered this phone but it was only renewed, I got the phone and it was in bad shape, so I returned it. Then I came across Amazon renewed premium so I decided to give it one more shot. They promised that the batter life would be above 90% so I took a chance. I was absolutely blown away, when I got the phone all setup I viewed the battery health and it was 100%! Super happy with this phone and I saved around $250 compared to buying it brand new!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","El producto est√° como nuevo"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This is what I was looking for and will probably get the next version next year"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","It seems like a pretty functional phone.. appears to work well in most capacities other than the battery, which is right off the bat draining very quickly with very mild usage. (Was assured to be at 90+%)(the last refurbished iPhone I bought came at 98% and after 2 years of usage is at 92%) So it‚Äôs a bit of a bummer because I‚Äôm just going to have to get the battery replaced soon. I honestly might just exchange the phone soon, just throughout writing this review the battery has drained 7%‚Ä¶. That is terrible in my opinion."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","love"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","After deciding I wanted to upgrade my phone I figured that going the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù direction was the most affordable option. I must say I was very hesitant at first. Even when I got the device, the plastic on it gave the impression it was banged up and the screen possibly cracked. Luckily for me I realized it was just the plastic, and after removing the phone looked as though it came straight out the apple store. It works just as good as well. All in all so far I think it was a great purchase."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This iPhone works like it‚Äôs brand new. If you are looking for a phone like this Buy it. Everything works as it should. Love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Face Recognition works great but read that it is too easy to replicate so I don‚Äôt use it. Prefer fingerprint recognition. Other than that the phone is great."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I think all iPhones are great phones-long time user here. I specifically wanted a 12 Pro Max; tried the 13 Pro Max from Apple Store & felt it was too heavy. This model just right and has almost all same features as the new 13. Hard to find locally to purchase, and the Renewed Premium is just like a new phone. Battery maximum capacity on it is 99% and body looks flawless! Definitely worth purchasing a Renewed Premium."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Soooo I‚Äôm originally a Samsung type a girl but my kids kept pressing me to try IPhone and I brought the 12 pro max, the phone over all is a great phone. It has face recognition for all my apps and purchases. My battery life is excellent also it will stay charged all day. The phone also came clean and with a cord and wall charger. I‚Äôve had it little over a month and so far so good it came with a yr warranty, so I‚Äôm very pleased with this buy"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","this phone is absolutely perfect!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I bought this iPhone 12 Max because it was advertised as ""unlocked"". I received it and installed it on my TMoble account. However, it would struggle to get onto the network and stay on it. I took it to TMobile and they gave me a new SIM card and the phone still struggled to find the network. As it turned out, the phone always looked for an AT&T network. This phone was also previously an AT&T phone per the codes in the phone's identification information. No matter how many times I selected the TMobile network it always switched back to the AT&T network and hence the phone was unreliable with connecting and staying on the network."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Alot of scratches on the front screen, and the phone had icloud locked by previous owner. Great job for a thousand dollars phone . And sure it been tested by professional technicians before it's going to your hand lol ."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered this phone in plenty of time, weeks before my son would get home on leave from the army. Got it charged up, & when he arrived we went to the Verizon store to get it activated. Turns out it was a locked phone, even though Amazon advertised it as an UNLOCKED phone right in the item description. Horrible. Waste of my time, and now we may not have time to get him another phone before he leaves. Amazon screwed this up entirely."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This phone has major sound issues I feel like I bought a broken phone. It does not have sound sometimes. I don‚Äôt think you should buy from these people. I tried to return it and I never got a response. I d give them no stars if possible"

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","The battery is not good"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Came home was happy I got it went to update it then all a sudden keeps restarting n wont stop"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","This renewed premium ""like new"" iPhone was nothing of the sort. It had three defects in the screen, one of which was as big as the head of a match! Avoid this seller."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","EL CARGADOR NO ES COMPATIBLE CON EL CELULAR YA SE ARRUINO"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Really disappointing they lie about the one main thing that makes this phone cost more than regular renewed."

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Title of review are words spoken by my older brother. In spite of the fact that this iPhone was ‚Äúrenewed,‚Äù my brother never mentioned this fact to me because for him it‚Äôs brand new. He is totally obsessed with all apps, cameras, ease of use, sound quality, and Pacific Blue color. Tremendous battery life and 256GB storage are awesome! I absolutely agree with my brother because I own the same phone in Silver. If you‚Äôre concerned that this phone isn‚Äôt compatible with the AT&T mobile network, DON‚ÄôT BE!"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I reviewed the product and it looks good without any physical damage, I did not get the original charger but that is not a big deal. I will update this review based on how this iPhone works in the next couple of months but I would recommend to buy"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","I upgraded from an iPhone 8 to use as my work phone. The speed and performance upgrades are super noticeable, and the battery life is in a whole new world.

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Primera vez que compro un equipo renovado. No sab√≠a que esperar. En Apple resulta que los equipos RENOVADOS PREMIUM son mejores y tienen una garant√≠a m√°s larga que los No Premium. Este tel√©fono que compr√© ven√≠a en una caja blanca con verde de AMAZON y en el interior un cable y cargador gen√©ricos. Al remover la protecci√≥n de pl√°stico del tel√©fono, mi sorpresa fue encontrar un equipo PR√ÅCTICAMENTE NUEVO. Ning√∫n golpe ni marca de otro tipo. Lo √∫nico que encontr√© (y porque le estuve buscando algo) una rayita diminuta en la pantalla junto al marco. Raya superficial de unos dos mil√≠metros‚Ä¶ La bater√≠a est√° al 91% y al encenderlo de inmediato se actualizo el sistema operativo a IOS 16.1.2
TODO, todo funciona muy bien. No se nota la diferencia entre un equipo nuevo y este. Definitivamente, es una Excelente inversi√≥n y decisi√≥n ir por este equipo."
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo lleg√≥ en aproximadamente 2 semanas. Todo muy bien. Est√©ticamente est√° al 100% y salud de bater√≠a 92 que considero que es muy bueno. El cable y cargador gen√©ricos pero nuevos de buena calidad. Muy recomendable."

"iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo llego 10/10 parec√≠a completamente nuevo, el mes de uso dej√≥ de obtener se√±al, lo lleve a revisar y estaba fracturado de la tarjeta, me cobraron 200 dls por soldarlo,"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Llego s√∫per bien. Sin ninguna detalle, con la bater√≠a al 100%; todo incre√≠ble, fue muy buena decisi√≥n.M√°s de 1 mes sin problemas!Recomendado!"

Muy recomendable"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Compr√© este iPhone con el miedo de que no cumpliera mis expectativas, afortunadamente, este iPhone se encuentra ""C√≥mo nuevo"" lo inspeccione durante un tiempo considerable y no tiene ni un solo rasgu√±o, la bater√≠a de encontraba al 100%"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","Todo muy bien"
"iPhone 12 Pro Max","el celular llego con una lijera raya en la pantalla, poco perceptible, pero para mi es un da√±o, al encenderlo y elejir el idioma, ah√≠ se queda y no avanza, p√©sima experiencia, ahora espero no me den tantas vueltas con mi reembolso ya que solicit√© la devoluci√≥n"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Se encontraba en un muy buen estado, la bater√≠a era moderada, todo se encuentra bien, Face ID, pantalla y sim. Recomendado."
"iPhone 12 Pro","This phone was a good purchase and value for money."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Usually the term refurbished and renewed scares people and right fully so. There are many sellers online that sell junk. If you carefully research the seller, you can have a great experience and save LOTS of $$. I bought this iPhone 12 Pro from Mobile Supply on AMZ and the phone was excellent! It honestly looked brand new. The seller was prompt and courteous on communication.
I have bought other Renewed items on AMZ and have had good experiences, but I would check out the seller each time."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Changed my review again seller sent screen with a screen protector in addition. Had given them 4 stars because of the price at the time but had changed it to 5 stars because everything about phone is excellent."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Super fast delivery. Product delivered ahead of schedule. Good quality."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Nice clean pretty much like new very satisfied"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I‚Äôm a little annoyed that the price dropped from $696 to $629 a couple days after ordering but I guess my timing was off with the 14 coming out. Battery health is at 90% but otherwise the phone is like new. Camera is such a step up from my XR! Definitely faster and I have better signal with the 5G. Happy with my purchase just wish I got a better deal. Comes with an extra charger which is nice because Apple does not include chargers anymore."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone looks and works perfect."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Like new condition, everything works! Love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","**Edit** 10/12/2022:

This phone's battery has now decreased to 96% since my last update a week ago. I lowered to 3 stars from 4 stars as this phone seems to be degrading fast!

------
Ordered this phone as a cost effective alternative to the 13 and/or 14 as the features and ""Bells and Whistles"". Was forced to update my previous device as the iPhone 7 no longer supports iOS 16 :-(

Thoughts on this order/process:

Pros:

-Looks brand new
-Faster than my iPhone 7 ;-)
-Camera is awesome
-Battery Life (con below) was received at 98%!
-Fast, seamless setup.
-Unlocked and Not T-Mobile (which I originally ordered)
-Came with charger cord/adapter
-Fast delivery
-Apple certified parts validated in settings (screen, etc.)

Cons:

-Battery life went to 97% after one week of use?! That makes me very nervous.
-There were some dings I found on the outer edge of the phone in 4 places-No biggie as there's a cover on it now.
-Wish there was an option for T-mobile vs. Unlocked. Apparently, there are multiple sellers on this product and even though I chose ""T-mobile"" I received ""Unlocked"" which is fine, but I paid more for the T-mobile vs. another seller that was a cheaper ""Unlocked"" option.

Other than that I'd rate this purchase 4-4.5. I will update accordingly as I progress with the life of this device. I'm just so happy to be upgraded to a newer iPhone!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It‚Äôs like a brand new phone!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Face recognition was on point . And battery life has been good . Way better than my old XR."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was very skeptical buying a refurbished phone but I am so happy I did! This phone is so amazing! There isn‚Äôt a single scratch on it and the battery life is even at 90%! Worth the money 100%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is great!! Looks like it just came out of the box! Real value for money!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone arrived 2 days early in neat packaging. It also came with a charger and thank you note. 100% battery life and the quality felt brand new. I recommend this company for phones for sure. Great service!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Todo bien pero una de las salidas de sonido ya no se escucha y por lo que vi a la mayor√≠a le toc√≥ la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a mayor a 95% y eso que compre la versi√≥n renovada en excelente estado‚Ä¶ es recomendable comprar l versi√≥n en medio y no la excelente porque no le veo diferencia‚Ä¶ puedo regresarlo hasta noviembre ah√≠ veo que tal va x 1 mes pero por el momento todo bien‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was very surprised. arrived as new, well before the deadline is very well packaged."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The seller is very responsive if you have any concerns or questions. Iphone 12 Pro came super fast and I am impressed, like new condition and the battery health is 100 percent. Very happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Feels like new. Some issues with the mic some times but overall good"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Good phone, it arrived in the estimated time, it does not have any scratches, neither on the screen, nor on the cameras, nor on the back. Everything works very well, and came with 89% battery life"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phones great and does everything an Iphone can do. Hopefully I dont need to purchase another phone for the next 2 years."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Battery life was 100% and condition was great,
Also got double the storage for no additional charge!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Product was perfect love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Really great!! In perfect condition, except battery with 80%, but as expected! Function and no scratches nor the screen or anywhere else, which was amazing for me for this price."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I was a bit skeptical about this company given some of the reviews but I‚Äôm so glad I took the chance. 2 things that shocked me was that the battery life is 100% and the phone came with a screen protector already on it, a new usb type c charging block and cable along with a pop socket. No regrets!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I just got my iPhone 12 pro in mail today, I want say it package real nice and phone feel luxury even thou is refurbished. In addition I will do my review testing out the phone and see if there's any fake going on but however it came in good shape, no scratches what so ever.

So guy if you want buy refurbished iPhone trust me is worth it, I am going take picture and do a video soon on it. I appreciate amazon as loyal customer and more shopping to come in the future. Appreciate however read this and let see how the phone goes. Thirdly, I want thank seller for well design packaging got a charger and sim kit, I hope in the future people can be honest about thier review before at hand test before you write about it."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente producto, lleg√≥ exactamente con todas sus descripciones de venta. Acertada inversi√≥n. Recomendado!!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Love the phone. Been wanting it since it came out and finally put some money together to buy it. I do must say I‚Äôm happy to be back with iPhone. I was stuck with a Motorola G4 for almost a year and a half and that phone took a beaten and I finally got tired of it lagging and been a bit of an annoyance to navigate. This phone is clean, sturdy, and very well put together. Love the cameras, I blew my friends mind when I showed him it could take pictures in the dark on SELFIE mode. Even for a refurbished phone it still looks brand new, no dings nor scratches. Looked very clean and smooth when I unwrapped it. And yea unwrapped it. Would‚Äôve prefer getting the whole ‚Äúbrand new fresh off the box‚Äù experience. But I‚Äôm not complaining. They secured it pretty well. Package might not be filled with bubble wrap but this phone is durable. All they needed was to wrap it around with some foam and the phone got to me in one piece, looked brand new. Didn‚Äôt even have to squint my eye I swear.
Side note I didn‚Äôt put a rating on the finger print because I do not know whether this phone has one. I haven‚Äôt bothered the face recognition is enough. It won‚Äôt rwcognize your face with a mask on (obviously) but it does recognize from all kinds of angles. Literally even as far as your arms can reach. I‚Äôve gotten myself an Apple Watch lately the 7 specifically and they go hand in hand love them both. I‚Äôve had the phone for 4 months now and it still looks brand new, I still take it out of the case and feel it. I did spent a grand on it, which for a lot of people it is pretty pricy but so far I haven‚Äôt had a complain or a regret for buying a thousand dollar phone. Which was a HUGE thing before I bought it. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm finally back with iPhone money doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre happy really.
Camera is crisp btw."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Looks and works like new. No scratches or anything"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone smaller than desired..."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Tengo el telefono ya 3 meses y hasta ahora todo esta perfecto. Lo utilizo en Ecuador y sirve bien con mi operadora. Entregado en caja generica, cable y cubo genericos de buena calidad. Nivel estetico 9/10 ya que la pantalla si muestra simbolos de uso y rasgpones menores.Finalmente para ser un telefono del 2020 es bastante costoso."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone works good no problems speakers loud üëäüèΩ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using to type this up"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Cre√≠ que era m√°s grande."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I have been buying Amazon refurbished devices for years and have always gotten great products. This phone was no exception. The time the phone shipped to me was super short. It did make me nervous when the phone didn't come in the Apple box, the phone was in mint condition. I also loved that there were screen protectors on the phone and a charger with the box. I have been putting this phone through the ringer and it is still great. Overall I would totally recommend getting this phone and I love mine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great phone with no issues on the phone. The phone charger didn‚Äôt work, as it was probably a refurb too. The cost was a little high, but the phone was like new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","i Have not use it yet , because it has a small but deep scratch on the left side of it that why i do not know how it work. I might keep it for XM gift."
"iPhone 12 Pro","There are two Big risks on the screen, then its a Good Condition phone, its not Excellent to me."
"iPhone 12 Pro","This is my first iPhone bought by myself i worked for it and ummm I‚Äôm not going to lie I mean to purchase the Pro Max BUT I accidentally bought the Pro only so yup there it is But I must say the phone is still amazing and looks so nice like if I would‚Äôve bought it from the apple store it had 100% battery life is 512GB that‚Äôs so good to have that much space to install how many games or videos I‚Äôd like and still have a toon of space overall I totally recommend this phone to anybody and it‚Äôs a great start before you get to the 13 Pro or Pro max because you don‚Äôt value stuff if you didn‚Äôt have something worse or less valuable before that definitely worth every penny."
"iPhone 12 Pro","When trying to activate the phone, I went to my carriers local store and tried to have the store person install my SIM card for me since my previous phone was destroyed. Once I arrived to the store, the store person starts to explain that when my sim is inserted that the phone‚Äôs sim was locked to a carrier. That confused me cause i clearly bought an unlocked phone so I reached out to customer service. At first, they didn‚Äôt even address the fact that I couldn‚Äôt activate the phone cause even when I clicked on the carrier locked option in the settings, it said that I had to contact the cell phone provider since it was locked to a carrier. They even tried to send a link to me to try to contact them from a different website when we already had an amazon chat opened ?? Definitely got frustrated before customer service finally got back to me & showed how the phone sent was compatible for my cell provider by checking the IMEI in the settings. Thankfully the phone is finally working!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","the product came with no scratches and no damage at all but after a day of owning I discovered that the top speaker was not working"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Pretty good refurbish. Everything really looks brand new. No scratches or marks on any of the surfaces and very clean glass. It was packaged well and arrived in good condition. My only complaint is that it arrived a little dirty. If you are buying this you might want to purchase a phone cleaner as well. While the screen and other surfaces were clean the speakers and charging port had dirt and lint inside that need to be cleaned."
"iPhone 12 Pro","My daughter is enjoying the iPhone 12. We had no problems with integration to Tmobile."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I had some doubts since this was not the super premium quality of renewed phone but it looks as new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","El encabezado del anuncio dec√≠a que se trataba de un 12 pro Max y a la hora de recibir el paquete lleg√≥ un 12 pro"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It came early, and well packaged. And looks brand new. It‚Äôs definitely worth the money."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Not original charger but I‚Äôll live def worth the savings will update if anything happens"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It's the first time I ordered a refurbished phone, and the quality of the device is way better than I thought. iPhone has solid software and design. I compared it with my old 7...in a nutshell, the Size is comparable, the home button is missing, and the camera was added. Switching between the two generations was difficult due to the missing home button, but after a day, I'm almost stopping to press on the display... Face id works brilliantly. Even recognized me with glasses in the car"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The screen was not original"
"iPhone 12 Pro","One camera lens appeared to have moisture/condensation inside, which made (3-4) watermarks/bubbles appear on the pictures."
"iPhone 12 Pro","La bater√≠a ha funcionado genial, estado del 100%, no ten√≠a ning√∫n rasp√≥n ni nada, el color es hermoso y la c√°mara incre√≠ble. Solo no me gust√≥ que el cargador no vino con el c√∫bito y el cable da√±ado"
"iPhone 12 Pro","mala calidad de la pantalla"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought 2 copies, a Blue one and a Space Gray. The blue one arrived with a small scratch on the surface (not on the screen), but with 100% battery capacity. The gray one, arrived in perfect shape (no scratches anywhere) but with 88% of battery capacity.It is what you are buying, a Renewed phone, not new, not used, somewhere in the middle and is certainly a gamble. They both are working perfectly and have no other flaws, i would give the product in general 8 out of 10, and would recommend it."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone 12 Pro is in over all good Condition but the battery Health is only at 90%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone come along with charging cable, Nice pakaging but charging cable are not working"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is in a great condition, it would have been perfect if the charger cable was in a better quality"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Good condition but battery doesn‚Äôt last much longer than my 2y old 11pro"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this refurbished. It looks brand new and works perfectly fine. In fact, it was so new you that it still came with the option to purchase AppleCare."
"iPhone 12 Pro","El tel√©fono funciona muy bien, es un excelente tel√©fono sin desperfectos est√©ticos, pero con un detalle que esperaba no lo tuviera pero lo tuvo‚Ä¶ la bater√≠a en condici√≥n de un 91%, un detalle."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Battery health is only 82%, not great"
"iPhone 12 Pro","El celular est√°n en muy buen estado pero, el encabezado del anuncio de este iPhone dice que es un 12 Pro Max (6,7 pulgadas), pero al recibirlo en realidad llega un 12 Pro (6,1 pulgadas)... Y para mi eso es enga√±o!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Hello, I first would like to say thank you for the timely shipping. However, I am not too impressed with the phone. I purchased from this seller specifically because of the reviews but it seems as if I got a bad phone. The front face of the phone is scratched to the top. The battery health is 88% and upon getting the turning on the phone it was dim, turned up the brightness still dim barely can see. This resulted with me taking it to the Apple Store and having them take a look. They told me it‚Äôs either software issue or a problem with the phone. I spent the money for an excellent condition phone and I‚Äôm not getting this"
"iPhone 12 Pro","My phone came with 100% battery capacity, no perceivable external damage. It was almost like new. Currently trouble shooting my phone crashing in video mode. Will up my stars if the issue gets resolved."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Exactly as described. Arrived with no damage and unlocked allowing smooth transition to a new phone!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I received my new phone yesterday and was delivered as promised. Arrived in excellent condition with a battery health of 100% which is far better than promised. So far, I'm working thru the learning curve, but set up was a breeze."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great value for the price."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I love it because it it just like a brand new iPhone and it‚Äôs fully unlocked and you pay not as much"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Only had it for a few days, but everything works and it seems to hold a charge well. The phone itself looks like new aside from the tiniest, hair-thin scratch on the bottom right corner of the screen. But honestly, you can‚Äôt even see it and it might have been from me lol so I‚Äôm not counting it as damage. Overall, really nice phone for the refurbished price."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this phone in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. Got it in the mail and went through the whole process of setting it up & transferring all of my information off my other phone. My husband calls me on it and the speaker doesn‚Äôt work!!! The phone is broken! You can barely hear the other person on the other end talk! How in the world do you let someone spend almost $600 on a phone that doesn‚Äôt even work!!! Very disappointing! Now I have to go through the whole process of returning and waiting for another phone."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Prior to me purchasing this product the reviews had me second guessing my decisions but after receiving my package i promise you all that it is worth it maybe i got lucky but despite all that i would definitely recommend purchasing commodities from trademore keep up the good job!!!-Jordi-Jovane"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Something wrong with the speaker"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone came as shown which was great, but the phone was locked so we couldn't use the phone no matter what we did. We tried to trouble shoot the phone to have the phone unlocked and we even found out that Verizon was the original carrier and called over to Verizon to unlock the phone and they couldn't unlock the phone. We liked the phone and wanted to keep it, but we were not able to as the phone was locked even though we were told it was unlocked. If we were able to use the phone and it was truly unlocked, I am confident we would have loved the phone and would have had no problems"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Works just as described"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I love it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It didn‚Äôt take long for the package to come, about 2 to 3 days. When it arrived, the phone looked like it was in perfect condition. Battery life was 94%, i recommend this product!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I am totally disappointed. I paid about $800 and expected the ‚Äùrenewed‚Äù phone at least look complete. But there are scratches all over the phone and the top half of the screen is broken.I spent a day using it and tried to accept the fact. But cracks on the screen seriously affect the feelings of use. I'm going to buy a brand new phone and using this as a backup."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Shipping was super fast, next day delivery. Battery life was very good (99%) and there was no obvious scratch. It has been more than a month since I got it, and everything is fine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is okay all around except for the battery. Battery life is horrible and it came with a battery health of 86 which is almost the recommended replace number I think it should have had a replaced battery as apart of the refurbish but that clearly did not happen very dissatisfied with that but others then that the phone works well and everything else seems to be good but if battery life is important this may not be for you."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The product is brand new. Aside from the battery percentage being 87%, it cosmetically has no wear and tear at all, because I assume it had a really good case on it prior. Definitely a great purchase for 700$. The battery being that way does not change anything drastically for the potential trade in value of the phone anyways so if you‚Äôre looking in to a renewed phone you should have great luck. If you don‚Äôt, return it and simply get different phone and it will be assured quality."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I have had good results with this purchase. Transfer of my information from my phone to this purchase was good, face recognition is good, no scratches or dings, battery life as described and I am pleased with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I heard that this phone is perfect especially for people who like taking pictures. I am very sorry that I have to return it at this time.I have only opened the packet and examined the phone. I have never turned it on. I did not input any information either. The only reason I entered a 3-star rating is because that goes either way.Thank you for your understanding."
"iPhone 12 Pro","When the phone arrived it arrived in excellent condition! It had no cracks or scratches, and it had 97% battery life. The shipping is 2 days although my package arrived a little late because of the holiday. The customer service is great and I had someone to answer all my questions right away! Shop with this seller, everything is a 10/10"
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was already logged in with a diagnostic app open, and the app showed that one of the cameras failed the test. The telephoto camera didn‚Äôt work and the phone said it detected a non-genuine apple camera. The battery health was also at 93%, which isn‚Äôt like-new. The only upside was that the body wasn‚Äôt scratched and did look like-new."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Battery life was 92% which means I've only had to charge every other day. No scratches or marks on phone."

Also, the camera and flashlight buttons on the home screen sometimes do not work. I press the flashlight, for example, and the button appears to be pressed but the light doesn‚Äôt turn on. For the camera, the screen will just turn black. Otherwise it works fine."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was very good overall and the battery health was 100% but the screws of the phone were missing. You lost a star dude."

I easily transferred the SIM card from my old phone to the new one and set it up with my phone carrier with no problems."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Everything was great and transferred over. My only complaint was the face recognition didn‚Äôt work. Other than that everything was fine"

"iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Really good for its price. Battery isn‚Äôt horrible I was worried about the battery but I‚Äôm honestly suprised. (I‚Äôm not getting paid for my review)"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Overall it was a great value. The battery health was as advertised (greater than 80%). It was 88% to be exact. The phone looks and works great."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Great improvement with the addition of ""raw"" photos. Possibilities are endless."
"iPhone 12 Pro","More Information on working conditions and transparency on major repairs of the phone (such as replacing camera etc). I found out by chance that major repairs were done to the phone. Too much emphasis on ‚Äòhow‚Äô the phone looks. Had I known in advance of the major repairs I would not have bought the phone. Price difference from new to renewed is too close."

"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone actually came in before the date it was due."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Definitely worth the money, works like new but the battery life is not what a new iPhones should be. Otherwise I‚Äôd highly recommend!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Fast shipping, great product and accesories. No complains. Exactly what I ordered"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Awesome iPhone, came like new, no to not visible scratches. I got it connected right away with my provider without any problem. Face recognition, extraordinaire. Battery life, pretty descent to handle all those features and last about 24 hours. Great technology is expensive, so, the price is acceptable for an item that is almost perfect."
"iPhone 12 Pro","I bought two of these phones, for my husband and I, with high hopes. One was fine, my only complaint for that one is that the battery is at 86%, but not noticeable.The second one was a disaster. Was fine when I first started it up, but then as I was setting it up I noticed that one of the back cameras was badly cracked. Now this wasn‚Äôt visible from the outside, but it was spiderwebbing cracked across two of the 3 cameras. Also, I got a warning pretty quickly by the phone that the screen was a third party screen and installed improperly. I went to the Apple Store and they said the best thing was to return it and just get my money back.I‚Äôm severely disappointed because now I have to go through the hassle of returning it as well as try and get a replacement. Not happy."
"iPhone 12 Pro","It‚Äôs a great phone but my phone back camera is having problems. My 12 Pro came in March 17 ,22 I don‚Äôt know why the camera doesn‚Äôt wanna focus it‚Äôs like trying to focus , but it‚Äôs shaking at the same time and making noises but if you zoom in or have wide view it doesn‚Äôt do that."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The back of the phone was not glass. It was replaced, nowhere in the description stated this."
"iPhone 12 Pro","The look, feel, and performance of this iPhone 12 Pro is in no way distinguishable from a new one. Not a single scratch, blemish, dent, or scuff on this phone. I would think all electronics from this seller are in perfect condition. Battery life is 96%"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Not sure what is up with this phone but it is the absolute slowest I have ever experienced. I thought that by ordering the 512G I would have a much faster loading time. I am wondering what is wrong with it. Even when I am connected to WiFi it takes 3-5 minutes to load internet browser pages. Not impressed at all & now have all my info loaded onto a phone that I am not satisfied or happy with."
"iPhone 12 Pro","No scratches no marks no scuffs and battery health was 100% phone was like brand new‚Ä¶. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt up to par is it didn‚Äôt come with an original charging block but that‚Äôs a very small issue if any issue at all"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I just got my phone and when I opened the box I saw the phone is already cracked. I didn't say anything until I saw the dirt inside the speakers, I was speechless... I put the phone to charge an hour ago and it's still on RED!!! I WANT REFUND ON MY ACCOUT!!"
"iPhone 12 Pro","For a renewed phone this is awesome! works perfectly no flaws battery is AWSOME! if i could give one piece of advice to the seller 86 FEDEX not the best haha but aside from the that the phone is a 10 out of 10 thank you!!"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Bought this phone since my other phone was broken. The appearance of it is great. Set it up and the camera option goes black. Contacted seller, but the suggested troubleshooting offered I had already done. Nothing fixed it! In addition, I can process a refund and return the phone which will leave me without a phone for over week. I need a phone with my job! I don‚Äôt recommend buying!"

"iPhone 12 Pro","I was excited to get the new iPhone and willing to pay the amount it cost but then I take it out of the box it came in and it already had minor scratches on the display and It was really off putting I can‚Äôt stop staring at it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","It can‚Äôt be updated and shut off every time"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I'm not usually one to make an accusation like that so quickly, but this phone clearly was never inspected by anyone.Here is what is wrong with the device I got: - It cannot hold a charge past 10%, I cannot even complete setup because it requires 20% to update the software. - The charging port only works for one side of the lightning cable, meaning half the time you plug it in you have to flip it around and plug it in again. This iPhone's charging cable is designed to be plugged in either way and still work. - It is dirty and has several chips around where the metal casing and screen meet (not a big deal but it is DEFINITELY visible from any distance you look at it from).I am convinced that this phone was purchased on eBay or something and upsold on Amazon. I am very upset that the $720 I spent on this phone went nowhere and will be expecting a refund."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Seriously, like a brand new phone! Can not tell the difference. Battery health is above 90% and little if any to no a scratches. Phone functions flawlessly. I would recommend this seller. Thank you!"

"iPhone 12 Pro","I like the Face ID don‚Äôt have to Remember passwords"
"iPhone 12 Pro","This phone had a big chipped area on the camera lens with a Crack going up the whole lens. It's terrible that they would ship it with that as noticeable as it was. Terrible"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I'm truly bummed that this phone didn't work out. My carrier spent hours trying to get their system to port in the phone but couldn't. Their conclusion, based on the error codes they encountered, was that the phone was made for use outside the US and had a manufacturers block on it that couldn't be removed - or maybe fraud. I hesitate to say that but who knows. The good news is that I reported this to Amazon and the device provider just as I described above and the device provider refunded my payment through the Amazon system - no questions asked."

I gave it the benefit of the doubt, let it charge and used my old phone for the day.Fast forward 72hrs later, the battery life is better but not still draining easily after it drops below 80%. Thankfully I reached out to Amazon and they are sending me a replacement (thank you!)Hoping my Asurion warranty will work on my new replacement and not just this iPhone with the poor battery life."

"iPhone 12 Pro","The phone didn‚Äôt work, it would just freeze when I try to set it up, also came with a minor crack on the screen, understand it s not new, but who wants to pay $600 to get a cracked screen.Took 10 days to have refund.Waste of time, but at least I got my money back."

The callers on the other end constantly complain that they cant hear me and its a lot of background noise and at other times, no sound. I can hear them fairly clearly but they have all sort of issues hearing me. This is my second purchase since the first one had cracks on the screen. Dont be like me, make sure that if you do purchase, thoroughly test it before sending it off to Canada as a gift! Save yourself the disappointment and expenses. Avoid these and just put the extra mone and buy from apple refurb or buy New if you can. Take my advice"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Mala apariencia del art√≠culo"
"iPhone 12 Pro","Scam"
"iPhone 12 Pro","I use to be a great fan of amazon renewed phones yet lately it appears quality control is severely lacking. Sometimes I‚Äôve got lucky yet about 50% of the time it‚Äôs been a real hassle activating the phone just to discover immediately or down the road something is defective. On this particular phone the camera didn‚Äôt work from the get go. I‚Äôd press the shutter button and it would click yet a photo would not be taken. Quite frustrating when the sole reason I was upgrading from an 8 plus was for the improved camera.If there is a good deal on a phone because they sell out so quickly you might want to buy 2 to insure that one of them works correctly. Personally, I am really reluctant to purchase another renewed phone because of the time involved setting up the phone only to have to spend more time taking it to a ups store to return it now that amazon doesn‚Äôt provide ups pickup wirhout paying an additional $7.99 for pickup."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Recived mine from a carrier new but coming from a 6s to a 12 is night and day! If your in the market for a decent iOS this is a great choice,my brother has the 12 mini he loves it,I even put aside my SE for this in Colbalt blue <3"

"iPhone 12 Pro","Phone arrived and was already powered on, which was strange. Came FILTHY. Gross caked on crud around the volume on/off switch, the speakers, and battery port so you knew the previous owner had a case on it. Tried to clean it because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was dirty or scratched but the gold edges were very scratched and chipped. Couple of scratches on the cameras. Didn‚Äôt activate phone so can‚Äôt say if this effects it yet. The price went down so I‚Äôve ordered a second one. Whichever is least-worse I guess I‚Äôll deal with. Will update."
"iPhone 12 Pro","Buy it"
"iPhone 12 Pro","This is my favorite iPhone the only problem is when I received it the middle camera had a crack across it. Also the sides are scratched up and the sound ports were very dirty. The biggest thing is the battery life is at a 87% capacity when I bought it and I felt a little cheated because it kinda does pretty fast as well as my xr did. I also cannot ever get Siri to work for me on this phone and never had that problem before and ft is always cutting off at random times and I can‚Äôt ever call anyone they have to call me and I answer it."

"iPhone 12","El porcentaje de bater√≠a es aceptable, los otros aspectos cumplieron con mis expectativas"
"iPhone 12","I ordered the iPhone 12 and not a scratch on it. I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use.

I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%.

Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector.

CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches. Front facing and the two back cameras ....

Overall great purchase."
"iPhone 12","It‚Äôs in beautiful condition and everything seems to work great so far. It‚Äôs only the first day I‚Äôve had it, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I got it within a couple days after ordering too, which was a plus."
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono estaba bien la verdad se miraba impecable lleg√≥ r√°pido .pero al mes dejaron de funcionar las c√°maras y el flash as√≠ que lo devolv√≠ fue dentro de lo que cabe f√°cil la devoluci√≥n y me renbolsaron mi dinero .pero es muy recomendable a mi parecer comprar as√≠ .la verdad muy contento es bueno tener la confianza de que no vas a perder tu dinero"
"iPhone 12","Just had bought the iPhone 12 renewed premium and this phone seems new to me. I couldn‚Äôt find any flaw it had 100% and it works just as new I‚Äôm very happy with this iPhone 12"
"iPhone 12","The ‚Äúgood‚Äù quality isn‚Äôt so good in my opinion. The phone has a ton of faded paint marks around the sides top and bottom of the phone. I‚Äôm not sure if every good quality iPhone is sold like this, but the quality was definitely more deteriorated than I expected. At the same time, the price mark is definitely better than a brand new one."
"iPhone 12","Day one and very happy with the condition of the phone. It is like brand new. The phone arrived a day early. Very happy so far with what I have used it for today. The seller was excellent to work with and offered to let me contact them should I have any other questions."

"iPhone 12","Phone came without a scratch & 100% battery life. I'm super impressed. Love love love my new phone."
"iPhone 12","The phone is a great phone definitely an upgrade from my iPhone XR. Camera is much better and so is the processor. However, I gave it 4 stars because it stated no visible damages, scratches, Etc‚Ä¶noticeable but there are just a few tiny nicks on the sides that I assume are from a case that‚Äôs is not so forgiving when taking on and off. Other than that, Nothing noticeable and the battery life is at 94% which is better than I anticipated. The 5g and quickness is also an upgrade. I believe this phone is great for the money spent compared to other prices I‚Äôve seen and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going for the 14 anytime soon."
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm disappointed in the battery life. I thought the battery would be new.
One reason I upgraded my phone was battery. I had a iPhone 7plus. I bought it brand new and the battery was starting to drain fast.
I haven‚Äôt tried the face recognition yet."

"iPhone 12","Fantastic phone - like new. I have been using it for a while now and had no issues. I would recommend anyone go with this seller."
"iPhone 12","excelente estado"
"iPhone 12","The spouse needed a new iPhone to replace the old iPhone 6 SE Apple that won't even update anymore. Years ago we replaced the battery on the old one and it was getting weak again, so it was way past time.

I was glad the refurbished unit I received was exactly as described. The battery shows 88% life left, decently over the promised value. I saw minor scratches in the metal but nothing really noticeable. I ordered a case and glass screen protector and you can't even tell it's not brand new.

The size of the phone is slightly taller and wider than the old 6 SE, so it seems familiar, but the face of the screen is MUCH larger, making it more usable. It works very similarly to the old phone, except for having no physical home button. The home gestures work easily and the setup had everything PLUS updates making all the old apps work, so the spouse was quite happy.

I, too, was happy doing ""tech support,"" because Apple does all the heavy lifting. Just kick off a backup to iCloud on the old phone (in case something goes wrong). When the backup finishes, move the SIM card to the new phone and turn it on. Set the new phone next to the old one, and follow the prompts. The data comes across and much of the setup will be just as expected.

I think if you're getting an Apple phone, a recent model certified refurbished phone is a good way to save a bit of money."
"iPhone 12","iPhone 12 arrived almost fully charged so that was nice, every piece of hardware on the phone worked and passed diagnostic tests. Has a few tiny nicks around the cameras but the screen is flawless. Battery had 87% out of 100% capacity so I‚Äôll have to replace it sooner rather than later, but isn‚Äôt a huge deal. Overall a fantastic upgrade from my iPhone SE 2020. The OLED screen is just beautiful.

Also, I ended up putting it in a LifeProof Fr√©, at $80 it‚Äôs a pretty penny for a case, but it offers extremely good protection without limiting access to the phone‚Äôs functions. Highly recommend both this phone and said phone case."
"iPhone 12","lo recomiendo 100%, buen estado de la bateria, conserbava su garantia aun por apple, en perfectas condiciones. lo unico esque tardo mucho en llegar. se recomienda al provvedor no enviarlo por usps"
"iPhone 12","Genius purchase here with quality care, detailed attention straightforward approach, and grand design in getting what you pay for, Comes with a year to return, comes completely acceptable as like-new, the item is fully functional and is not in anyway meant to be purchased just for money consumption. I got what I paid for and at a closer price than getting a new product, this like new product is way more acceptable. Grab yours today. Also, keep in mind the GB. Storage is essential. I know my 128 will not fail me, go higher if you are a content creator."
"iPhone 12","CP is not a dual sim phone. Very disappointed."
"iPhone 12","I gotta say I was surprised that the phone looked almost brand new, although the color around the camer were stripping off but that was no big deal because I bought camera lens protector to put around it so there was nothing to complain about. The battery health was at 85% which is very good for a good phone, everything worked fine and I am very pleased with my order. So if you‚Äôre having 2nd thoughts about buying from HYBRID IT, just buy it because this was a great buy. üòÑüëç"
"iPhone 12","Perfect"
"iPhone 12","Great seller with fast service. Review 48+hours of use: The device works properly well with fast battery charge, the physical condition of the device could be better, I will buy again from this seller."
"iPhone 12","I love this phone! Came with a small dent in the top right corner but it doesn‚Äôt affect the phone and it isn‚Äôt very visible. I‚Äôve had it for about two months and still not a single problem! Although, at this point in time, I would go buy a brand new one from Apple just because you would be its first owner and you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about any scratches or defects. If you do buy this phone, it isn‚Äôt much different from a brand new one."
"iPhone 12","The refurbished phone was in good shape and still had the glass screen protector. Power adapter and cable were generic, but who doesn't have either of those these days?"
"iPhone 12","Everything about the phone was fine aside from the earpiece speaker not working and the speakers on the bottom only work half the time. Sometimes they randomly cut to half volume even when it‚Äôs turned all the way up. Battery came at 80 something % so not bad."
"iPhone 12","Amazing"
"iPhone 12","Recib√≠ el tel√©fono en perfectas condiciones ,sin un ray√≥n, todo en orden y funcionando perfectamente"
"iPhone 12","Bought a acceptable iPhone 12 came in really good condition a little dirt in the speakers and a little scratch and at 87% battery life"
"iPhone 12","First time buying a ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone. I was happy with my iPhone 6+ but the whole world is 5G. Screen size is just an 1/8 of an inch more narrow, but it is almost an inch taller than my 6+."
"iPhone 12","External body like a new.
Battery health 89%
Camera and sound ok
Screen with no scratch"
"iPhone 12","Every works just fine, and it looks great"
"iPhone 12","Got this to give my old phone to someone else and it‚Äôs just good as buying a new one, of course the corners came scratched but with a case on you don‚Äôt even know. Got it turn on with no problems so it‚Äôs unlocked like it says."
"iPhone 12","I like the phone. I bought it because it has a Ceramic Shield glass that is 4x better against breaking if dropped.
It is a second hand phone and it has a screen protector on it. This was unknown to me.
There are 4 marks on the screen protector that bug me.
I‚Äôm hoping I can remove the protector."
"iPhone 12","Me gusto"
"iPhone 12","The phone is really good, but my only complaint is that the screen had some small but kinda noticeable scratches on the top of the screen. Everything else was perfect, even the battery was at 100%. I would definitely recommend this phone, if you don't mind a little scratches on the screen."
"iPhone 12","SIM removal tool product missing.
Phone color fade out near back camera. please checkout images.

Requesting to send good condition another phone without any damage."
"iPhone 12","Good buy, there‚Äôs a slight cosmetic damage on the top edge of the phone but it doesn‚Äôt show once the case is on, so not a dealbreaker. Battery Health was 100% and lasts long."
"iPhone 12","Phone freezes at times and glitches but overall I love the color and size of the phone"
"iPhone 12","This thing is practically new. VERY minor scratch but other than that, perfect. Definitely worth the risk to buy refurbished."
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","Very much like a brand new phone. Everything works and was able to get it set up in about 5 minutes. Only two or three knicks that are very small but understand for a refurbished phone. 100% happy with my order. (Haven‚Äôt had it long enough to review the battery life)"
"iPhone 12","Screen was broken. Screen was also faulty. Waste of time to buy this to have to return."
"iPhone 12","The shipment came a day earlier and able to use it within minutes of unboxing it. Facetime and everything worked"
"iPhone 12","Bought as a secondary phone for my Galaxy S22 Ultra. I bought Acceptable Condition and the only real wear I see is a few paint chips on the aluminum sides, which you can't see unless looking really close. Battery health at 88%. Also came with a preinstalled screen protector. Ended up taking that off since it messes with the facial recognition.

The packaging was quite disappointing. Just came in a USPS small priority box that was damaged, and the phone only had one layer of bubble wrap and was sliding out of it as I opened the box."
"iPhone 12","Well. It‚Äôs an iPhone 12. I got what I paid for. A few things though:

-The package did not come with a SIM card tool.
-The battery health was at 87% when I received it. Not cool.
-The phone did, however, come with a free screen protector pre-applied. It wasn‚Äôt applied evenly, but hey, at least it‚Äôs free.

Would buy again for a friend in the end."
"iPhone 12","My granddaughter loves the phone."
"iPhone 12","Todo bien con el celular esta en excelentes condiciones esteticas no tiene detalles de uso. Lo unico malo el cable con el que me vino la primera vez que lo use se rompi√≥."
"iPhone 12","The ear speaker is filthy. Other than that the phone looks like new. Battery life is 91% which isn‚Äôt horrible."
"iPhone 12","My battery life is already 80% not good for an ‚Äúexcellent condition ‚Äú"
"iPhone 12","Everything about this phone is good except for the screen. It‚Äôs hard to type and scroll through social media. You have to use your entire finger not just the tip. It‚Äôs really insensitive."
"iPhone 12","The phone is mostly ok. The screen has an issue (there is a small area that looks faded one the sceeen is off, noticeable when screen is on), however, biggest issue and why I gave 3 stars is because the Esim is still locked to AT&T, the previous carrier of the phone. Which means I can never have two numbers in this phone. I will contact Amazon about this and update this review based on their response."
"iPhone 12","This iphone 12 battery health was less than the 90% they say on the product description. The phone also had a very visible ding on both sides of the power button and to top it all, the return process was much worst than other product. Amazon requires UPS to pick up the item at the address where it was delivered and that cost me a day's work."
"iPhone 12","Received iPhone 12 securely packaged with a new charger and pin to remove sim card. Cosmetically the phone looks great. So far it has been functioning well too. I am hoping this one will last us, our last refurbished phone from a different reseller had issues within a year."
"iPhone 12","Genuinely yes this was a great phone saves money just like new saw absolutely nothing wrong with it"
"iPhone 12","No Frills, arrived as advertised, phone felt like someone used it for a few months before trading it in for a newer model. Lifelong android user and this was my first iPhone (GSM Carrier). I was able to put my SIM in and my phone was online and working within the hour. Had the phone for a bout a week now and the hardware feels great - I feel confident that the battery is at least at the 80% level that they say it is.

If I have to be picky, there is a minor scratch that can only be seen if the phone is held at a sharp angle to the light. There is also some scuff marks on the sides where the phone was potentially rubbing on something. Both of these extremely minor gripes vanish when I put on a screen protector and a phone case.

Final Verdict: I'm very happy I made this purchase and it was fantastic value. I got over the ""renewed"" feeling pretty quickly, but I can see how that might bother some people."
"iPhone 12","iPhone 12, decent condition. Battery life disappoints, some rashes on the edges but overall decent."
"iPhone 12","my phone is next to perfect! i found the tiniest scuff near the camera on the back of the phone, but i really had to hunt to find any imperfections at all. battery at 92% and lasts all day with constant use. speaker sounds great. phone calls are clear. very happy with my purchase."
"iPhone 12","When we first got the phone the wifi and the Bluetooth didn't work.. after several times of resetting tge network. It randomly turned on."
"iPhone 12","The phone arrived quickly and was good value for the price as I didn‚Äôt want to pay full price for a 2 year old phone. However I did order the wrong storage size therefore returned the product."
"iPhone 12","Stop getting notications and a faulty charger, does not charge properly. I caution anyone who is thinking of getting a refurbished iPhone it's best to pay for a new one. I'm sending my back. Glad these issues manifested its self before the 30 days are up."
"iPhone 12","Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the best photo of the phone. Sorry about that. What I will say is, there are absolutely no visible damages to this phone- not on the screen, any of the cameras, the sides or edges, and not on the back. The phone operates like new- and in fact, If I bought it without realizing it was renewed, I would have thought it to be brand new. I think perhaps the only thing is that the sound clarity was iffy at first, but that could have just been me because it is absolutely fine now. I wanted to wait the full 90 days before giving an honest review, but so far everything has been fine. The battery life is superb- it is 6:10 PM now and It‚Äôs battery is at 75% without charging and with a decent amount of use during today. I really am enjoying the phone so far, however if anything changes, I will probably edit this review.
In short, I do believe the purchase was worth it!"
"iPhone 12","I use my phone for pretty much everything and the battery isn‚Äôt bad it does go a bit faster if your using it all day but that‚Äôs any phone"
"iPhone 12","The I phone 12 arrived quickly but was poorly packed. It was delivered loosely in a bubble sleeve in a box in a plastic mailing envelope. The sleeve was inadequate to keep the phone from rattling around inside the box. The phone was listed as excellent, same as new, but the phone had noticeable scratches on the top area of the screen. Other than those two gripes, the phone otherwise was in excellent shape and was able to be initialized properly. After staring at the screen scratches for a few hours, I decided to return the phone, at my own expense."
"iPhone 12","It worked right away, I‚Äôm not entirely used to IPhones so I did have a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to use it. Now that it‚Äôs been nearly a month since I bought it, it works fantastic, the storage is great and I didn‚Äôt even notice any superficial damage like the product says it does. Honestly, I‚Äôd recommend if you want an IPhone but are hesitant, believe me I get you, I‚Äôm certain you can trust this."
"iPhone 12","The battery dies really fast. Last night it totally shut off and I couldn‚Äôt turn it back on. That was frustrating. But finally got it working again."
"iPhone 12","The phone functions properly I received mine with 89% battery life there is a pretty deep scratch on the screen but overall decent price for the phone"
"iPhone 12","I was hoping a better battery life since I choose the ""excellent"" condition, also I still can see scratches around the phone."
"iPhone 12","Product arrived one day early, only couple small marks in the screen but overall it's better than I expected. A+"
"iPhone 12","El celular es totalmente funcional. Las peladuras y rasgu√±os son casi imperceptibles. Los parlantes ven√≠an un poco sucios. Por todo lo dem√°s est√° muy bien."
"iPhone 12","Apple genuine parts and fast shipping, I love my new phone!"
"iPhone 12","This product was incredibly good"
"iPhone 12","Read deal"
"iPhone 12","Shipping didn‚Äôt take long. Works perfect i purchased an iphone 12+ at store and had so many issues and havent had a single problem since we received it nothing everything works good."
"iPhone 12","Bought an iPhone12 from Networkstore. Shipped quickly and was in perfect condition. Battery life was 100%. Easy to set up and came securely packaged."
"iPhone 12","perfect condition, & 100% battery. couldn't be happier with Amazon!!"
"iPhone 12","The product looked brand new and in perfect condition. We‚Äôve had it a couple of weeks and it came in perfect working order. So happy to have bought it from this seller! Thank you SO much! We couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the product, delivery time, or the entire experience."
"iPhone 12","I always get worried when i see refurbished in the title, but this time i decided to go for it since it was a great prime day deal, and it came 1 day sooner. I got the Iphone 12 green and i was amazed that it looks brand new with only 2 minor scratches on the back. Thats no problem since its going to have a phone case. Overall its a great buy."
"iPhone 12","Product came on time and works perfectly! Don‚Äôt usually buy phones online but this was perfect"
"iPhone 12","All features work perfectly and the housing is in excellent, near new condition. There was one very small knick at the top but was covered by the phone case. Overall a great buy as I was able to save over $200 unlocked and battery life was 90%."
"iPhone 12","Battery life 89%"
"iPhone 12","Would recommend all the negative comments are strange because mine was just fine"
"iPhone 12","Si"
"iPhone 12","I liked it very well"
"iPhone 12","Wonderful phone beautiful. Mint condition not scratches runs perfect out of the box so far. It's been only a few days and no used it on a regular basis yet but impressive so far"
"iPhone 12","Honestly, for $200 off this is a steal. Battery came at 90% health, no scratches that I can find, clean screen, great face recognition. The only way I could tell that it was used was the charging port had a really small amount of dust. Otherwise would‚Äôve never known it was used."
"iPhone 12","This phone purchase was GREAT! Price was reasonable, phone is AMAZING and literally perfect! No issues, even received it earlier than anticipated."
"iPhone 12","Charging cable not working, it does not charge the phone. Went to service center and they said, charging cable is not appropriate to charge the phone, i need to buy another one. My only question to seller, why they do this kind of cheap work, where they gave a faulty charging cable. Would not recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12","This phone came in great condition. The only thing was the battery health was in the mid 80s like around 85%. Otherwise, great buy."
"iPhone 12","Phone came with a broken ear speaker. For some reason, neither of the speakers were inspected according to the Amazon Renewed ""20-Point Inspection Test Certificate"". There is visible damage to the ear speaker as per the photo attached. These parts should also be tested. The phone cannot be used as a conventional phone with this broken critical part. I will be returning this phone; very disappointing.

Edit: (Adjusted from 1 to 3 stars) Immediately after returning the phone, I purchased an identical one. I‚Äôve had it for about 6 months and it works great with no issues. No damage, scratches or other wear. The phone is fast and battery is normal. When it comes to used items like this, it‚Äôs a gamble. Thankfully there is a return policy when you get a bad apple."
"iPhone 12","Very good product....battery is 97%"
"iPhone 12","Amazing quality definitely recommend!"
"iPhone 12","No supero mis expectativas como lo hab√≠a hecho en otras ocasiones."
"iPhone 12","Have to make calls on either speaker or with AirPods in :("
"iPhone 12","Excelente servicio y producto"
"iPhone 12","I was a little afraid their would be a lot of scratches since this is my first time getting a renewed device and I was honestly surprised. Also if you get the T-Mobile version it will work with T-Mobile owned places like metropcs. Mine came literally with no scratches, it was also well packaged. The battery does last a while and charges fast too. I recommend getting a separate charging block but the charger that does come with is good. I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase and not disappointed :)"
"iPhone 12","This iPhone was. Shipped promptly, it arrived safely. It‚Äôs operating at full capacity!! Looks like new!!"
"iPhone 12","I ordered this phone as fully unlocked. When I received it I quickly realized that the sim was locked by Verizon. Luckily I was able to find a website that unlocked it online for around $40 instead of having to send it back. Not to happy I had to spend an additional $40. Other than that good phone üëç"
"iPhone 12","Great phone but I removed the screen protector because the touch screen was slow and I discovered some scratches on the screen."
"iPhone 12","Exactly as described. Excellent pre-owned condition. Best iPhone I‚Äôve ever owned."
"iPhone 12","I was looking for a uphone/renewed but was concerned about the battery life or scratches/damage. This phone came immaculate, with 100% battery life. I am very satisfied with this purchase I just transferred all my data so this is the first day very pleased with purchase so far"
"iPhone 12","Battery life was at 100%. Looks basically brand new with no noticeable cracks or scratches. Good experience overall."
"iPhone 12","Phone came in pristine condition. Battery health at 94%. Would definitely recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12","Buen estado, bun funcionamiento y bateria al 90 %, recomendado 100%"
"iPhone 12","Got this and it was new no marks.Battery life was a 100%. I definitely 100% recommend."
"iPhone 12","Came with 100% battery life but price went down $50 since my purchase üòü"
"iPhone 12","Came faster then expected and in perfect condition!I was leery getting a second had phone this way, but very happy with what I got and it has absolutely no problems what do ever."
"iPhone 12","So fair, phone works fine. But I'm a bit disappointed by the condition of the phone. The sides are scratched and worn."
"iPhone 12","The frame had dirty spots on it and the charger and speaker ports were dirty"
"iPhone 12","Came in two days sooner than expected, came with 80% charge and works amazingly! been looking to upgrade my phone to a new one at a reasonable price. didnt want to spend $1000 on a brand new phone! Found this one and decided to buy it based on reviews. so happy i did!"
"iPhone 12","For a iPhone that is like $600 buy it"
"iPhone 12","Excellent conditions as described. No problems with the phone"
"iPhone 12","I honestly have never ordered a phone on Amazon before because I was always a little skeptical but these guys delivered the phone came with 90% battery life and it‚Äôs like new with just a few minor scratches on the outside aluminum 10/10 would buy again."
"iPhone 12","Apple sells a brand new, yes brand new iphone 12 at the time of this purchase for $699. This will be new with a full 1 year warranty, plus option to extend to a second year. This item sells for $539, used, scratched up, don't know what it's been through, and comes with a 3 month warranty from Amazon ""renewed"". I think Amazon is genuinely trying to do good here, but these third party vendors are not living up to their end. I received a supposedly ""like new"" iphone 12, and it came with more than 11 cuts on the screen, 3 deep, 4 medium, and 4 other significant cuts easily visible. I just don't know what these vendors are doing, wasting time, resources sending these phones back and forth. Amazon needs to better enforce the standard for phone condition better. The back and forth is not good for the environment, or time, all of which in short supply. I Cannot recommend this seller, at all."
"iPhone 12","Just got it. Seems okay"
"iPhone 12","The iPhone 12 I was sent was in excellent refurbished condition. I‚Äôm a very happy customer üòÄüëçüèº"
"iPhone 12","The purchasing process was very smooth, was shipped quickly and safely, and communication has been excellent. The phone did have a noticeable scratch on the glass of the screen however with the screen protector on it is barely noticeable. Other than that everything is as advertised in like new condition."
"iPhone 12","Description says the phone is refurbished, and honestly I just was looking for an iPhone to use alongside my Android phone. I actually love this phone, and it was cheaper to buy it here than Apple itself. Phone is fully functional and has 0 cracks or scratches. Well worth the money!"
"iPhone 12","I'm still learning the different aspects of my phone, but so far it is great."
"iPhone 12","2 scratches on front screen. to replace a screen is 200-250. also the battery is at almost 80 percent battery life so it drains pretty fast! says it was in excellent condtion and it was not ! not worth what i paid for it!"
"iPhone 12","Excelente producto"
"iPhone 12","Muy buen producto. Solo faltaron los aud√≠fonos"
"iPhone 12","it running late but that fine"
"iPhone 12","Funciona muy bien el reconocimiento facial la vida √∫til de la bater√≠a me toc√≥ al 88% es muy aceptable muy buena inversi√≥n comparando el precio con sudam√©rica el celular est√° como nuevo"
"iPhone 12","Just like new! I'm happy, easy to upload my old information no issues."
"iPhone 12","Se ve y funciona de maravilla apresar de ser renovado, solo un detalle que el cargador y el cable son gen√©ricos, se recomienda comprar los originales ya que estos pueden afectar y da√±ar el celular a la larga"
"iPhone 12","For $500, include a charger with the same specs as what originally comes with the phone. The subpar $0.10 1A USB-A charger from 2015 it came with would take 12+ hours to charge an iPhone 12 that's turned off, NEVER if turned on. It went straight in the trash."
"iPhone 12","wouldn‚Äôt unlock"
"iPhone 12","Quick delivery, safety precautions for delivery we‚Äôre awesome. Exactly what I was expecting!"

"iPhone 12","The battery life does not last long and the screen is sluggish when using it."
"iPhone 12","Everything looked good with it. 5 months later it constantly shuts off and wont update. I mean i hoped id get more than 5 months for $1000"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Minor damage just a few barely noticeable scratches on the screen, everything was working great but now I‚Äôm having so many problems, when I went in to connect it to my account it said it was still on someone else‚Äôs. Now it‚Äôs connected but I‚Äôm having so many issues I tried restarting it when I had a problem and when I tried to turn it back on it kept shutting itself off and when it finally stayed on none of my app icons were loading and my apps crashed when I tried going on them. My texts are disappearing after I send them I‚Äôm surprised this app loaded when I opened it"
"iPhone 12","I was happy to find the exact phone I wanted in the refurbished section. This is actually good enough to be new. The battery is at 100% maximum capacity and the screen and body are in pristine condition. The price was great too. Overall very pleased with purchase."
"iPhone 12","M√≥vil como nuevo sin marcas desgastes de bater√≠a al 97%"
"iPhone 12","Iphone12 died 95 days after purchase of $630.18. Was kept in otter box in my purse. Was never dropped, gotten wet, left in car or outside. Just died overnight in my purse in my dining room on 0ctober 27/28th. Warranty/ return was October 21, 2022. Im a disabled senior and the only way I could afford is with Amazons 12 month same as cash payment plan. Took to 2 repair places and phone no good.
Amazon contacted suupplytronic they replied twice with exact same message: past warranty date and take fr repair! Which I previously told them I had taken to repair! So,help what so ever from them!
I‚Äôve purchased 4 refurnished phones and a IPad for Amazon and they are all working find to this day! Will try Amazon again and will never purchase anything from supplytronics againüòíüò£üò†"
"iPhone 12","Used for two months then it conked out. Black screen won‚Äôt charge or then on. Was great until then."

"iPhone 12","Love it. Totally worth it. Nothing wrong and basically brand new"
"iPhone 12","Lo √∫nico que no me gusto fue la bater√≠a que vino 89% pero del resto todo excelente recomendado"
"iPhone 12","Bought this for my partner and was thrilled to be able to get the purple she preferred for under $800. Delivered on the first of the delivery window in like new condition. The only problem she had connecting the phone to her service was actually an error on T-Mobile‚Äôs end when they cancelled her old SIM instead of transferring. Supervisor said it was new hireü§∑üèª."
"iPhone 12","This phone came wiped to factory setting but had a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) installed from the IT department of Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although they are software to by-pass MDM the phone was worthless to me. I took the phone to my local Apple Store and the tech stated that the MDM can only be removed by DHS. I was unable to upgrade my Iphone 8 to this Iphone 12. Once I restart the phone the MDM would come up asking for a DHS login and password. Worthless."
"iPhone 12","Great as advertised!"

"iPhone 12","I got the phone and everything seemed fine. That was until I took it outside and the Data didn‚Äôt work.Ended up returning better off going to apple"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 As you can see by the video, I received a phone that had a very inconsistent response. I thought it was just a bug first setting up the phone, then once I got it all set up it still had some inconsistencies with the responsiveness of the screen. I don't know if this was just a one off thing but it's annoying that it happened to begin with. You expect (especially when buying a refurbished product) for it to be fully tested and make sure issues like this don't occur. Now I have to return the product, wait for the refund to process and buy another phone; which is truly a giant inconvenience when this could've been prevented with a slightly more thorough testing. It might've just been a one off thing, but it's still shouldn't be happening; may I also note that the phone was barely protected during shipping (inside a box that was too big, with a bag and a plastic screen cover on it) which could've also been prevented and may have been another factor that would've messed up the phone during shipping."
"iPhone 12","Just came a little scratched"

"iPhone 12","I bought this phone for someone outside USA. Unfortunately calls work only on loud speaker which we dint realize during initial set up. This is a major issue and it literally makes the phone unusable. I tried to contact the business for return or replacement but they have a no return/ replacement policy when taken outside USA. The worst part of it all is when I checked Apple for IPhone 12, it is available almost for the same price. Not sure why I went through all the trouble for getting this phone!"
"iPhone 12","I just opened my package today & it looked like this. I already used the charger for my other phone."
"iPhone 12","It came in decent conditions but the scratch on the screen upset my girlfriend a lot"
"iPhone 12","The fact that they overly advertise the product. Yes it was clean without scratches but the battery? Yeah that was done for. From the moment I got the phone it was dead and never charged I had to go get it fixed myself instead of waiting for a refund"
"iPhone 12","Battery 87%, the screen was of poor quality and it has cosmetic damage. I returned the cellphone"
"iPhone 12","I have used different sim (T-Mobile, lycamobile and AT&T) but iPhone unable to select the network. Even I trued manual selection , I didn‚Äôt work. Rebooted multiple time , no use. I have requested for refund
Let‚Äôs see the response.
I did more research on the ICCID number, it says Unknow, it means it is defective or phone is locked.
As per the product description, it is unlocked phone. Seller is not paying for the return shipment which is one more disappointment"
"iPhone 12","Just loved overall very happy"
"iPhone 12","Me lleg√≥ hoy, esta muy bien cuidado, todo 10/10"
"iPhone 12","Everything I need/want in a phone. camera is exceptional, change over from earlier phone was easy. hope to have this phone for several years."
"iPhone 12","Workinh just fine"
"iPhone 12","For a product sold as 'Excellent condition - renewed', this arrived with very visible scratches and dents on the body and a malfunctioning screen already giving errors. Seems like it was not handled well by technicians, has low quality aftermarket parts and is being passed off as excellent - I'd say good at best. Wouldn't recommend."
"iPhone 12","Paid $460 dollars for a phone that was fraudulent! It was a off brand phone in iPhone case. It was CRACKED and it screen didn't work and all u could hear was a woman speaking some language I couldn't even identify. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!"
"iPhone 12","This a good phone , it‚Äôs basically brand new"
"iPhone 12","iPhone constantly says no service. It has done this since phone was received and connected. I thought it was the service provider so I switched services and it is still doing it. I have tried everything that google says to fix it and nothing has worked. Not sure if I was sent a defective phone or what. Unsatisfied with product."
"iPhone 12","Compre el celular para abot√°rgame algo de dinero, pero tuve que cambiarle la pieza que lee el chip, como lo ped√≠ para otro pa√≠s ya no pude devolverlo, a la final gaste lo mismo que habr√≠a gastado por un celular nuevo."
"iPhone 12","I bought one for myself in June and one in December for my girlfriends daughter. No issues. I don‚Äôt know where these horror stories are coming from."
"iPhone 12","No tiene ni rasgu√±os y funciona perfectamente. Recomiendo la compra"
"iPhone 12","The speaker is low and muffled, and needs to be replaced. It should have been caught and fixed by the original seller, but they missed it. Now I have to spend more money to get it fixed."
"iPhone 12","Not premium condition! Battery was only at 85% health. Premium price guaranteed minimum of 90% Battery health! Be careful when ordering premium and paying extra. There is no special support or service."
"iPhone 12","Worth buying phone looks brand new very much renewed I‚Äôm very satisfied with my purchase"
"iPhone 12","Really like the new design with the iPhone 12."
"iPhone 12","Title"
"iPhone 12","This iphone cannot stay connected to my carrier (sprint, now tmobile) for more than 10 minutes. I've had it for 2 days and for maybe 2 hours TOTAL, I have had cellular signal. It randomly connects and disconnects. I was using it as a GPS today and it went blank on me. This is my hometown where i always have had signal with iphones and my carriers. I spoke with apple support and they confirmed that I was sold a faulty device and that this ""pre owned"" process amazon has is a JOKE. They do not inspect these devices fully. and You have a HUGE chance of getting a faulty device. My device looks fine from the outside. No scratches or smudges. But unless you have wifi, this device is nothing for you. Im stuck with a glorified ipod touch at this point. I cannot make calls or use this phone outside my house, period. This was my first and last order with amazon renewed services. Do yourself a favor and get a new one or get one from anywhere but amazon's preowned services. amazon preowned department is a bunch of monkeys pretending to know what a working phone is"
"iPhone 12","Touch screen top section non responsive in less than 1 month light use. No replacement option and even Amazon could not contact the seller. Returning to Amazon for a refund."
"iPhone 12","Very good product as described and expected. Very robust and easy to use and configure."
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","La pantalla estaba maltratada y la vida de la bater√≠a no vale la pena"
"iPhone 12","This was the best gift to myself item is in great condition no regrets. Great seller I would recommend them to anyone"
"iPhone 12","I have purchased 3 iPhones in the past three months for family members and two out of the 3 were damaged. This iPhone 12 had the button glued shut. They physically did not press or click or worked at all. I also ordered and iPhone 11 Pro Max which had the wifi not work (Literally greyed out and disabled) and yes I did every single recovery, reset and including DFU Reset. Idk who are the Block heads that's ""Inspecting"" and ""Testing"" these phones but they are so obviously broken I highly doubt anyone is doing any type of testing. Furthermore, the returns are outrageous. 30+ day for ""Return Processing"" Plus another 7-14 days for the money to be returned to your account. 40+ days waiting for a refund on a phone that came damaged and was shipped out literally the same day."
"iPhone 12","en la pantalla indica que el respuestao no es orginital, la camara terrible, LAMENTABLEMENTE yo vivo en Guatemala y me sale muy caro mandarlo a devolver, pero fue muy mala compra"
"iPhone 12","It was great"
"iPhone 12"," Phone is in physically great condition but it won't charge and battery health is 88%"
"iPhone 12","Hasta el momento el tel√©fono llena mis expectativas, el
Producto vino bien embalado, bien protegido y y al momento que lo estaba como lo hab√≠a pedido"
"iPhone 12","Great"
"iPhone 12","The iPhone is great it's almost like brand new and I would totally recommend it!"
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone on the quicks to replace my old Iphone 7+ that broke, it says in the description that this phone comes fully unlocked and everything, my sim card isn‚Äôt working at all, i can‚Äôt get no types of service, it literally says i have no service even when my service is completely active, i had to order a replacement sim because i thought my old sim wasn‚Äôt working, turns out it‚Äôs just this phone ü•≤ , this is so frustrating cuz i love this phone and everything but i just want to be able to make calls and use my phone without wifi, i could‚Äôve just went and bought this for the full price off apple and been using my service. this is so upsetting"
"iPhone 12","The product shipped quickly and was in very good condition."
"iPhone 12","I think this iPhone comes as one as new as far I haven‚Äôt noticed any imperfections or signs of used phone. Totally in good condition almost mint"
"iPhone 12","The phone broke on me in 3 months got it fix and it never started working right again. What a waste of money would never buy a refurbished phone again. I contacted the seller and they weren‚Äôt able to do a thing for me and I was just ignored for a few days right before my warranty ended"
"iPhone 12","Screen went blank after 3 months. Took it to Apple store. They said the screen was damaged and repair was not done properly leading to moister buildup. Total garbage. Don't buy from here."
"iPhone 12","Love my iPhone . Received it promptly and it appears to be new. I got my information transferred and it so much better than my former iPhone . I would recommend this product to my family and friends."
"iPhone 12","Damage product with a lots of scratches. very bad quality. What a waste of time and money."
"iPhone 12","I bought this phone, bought a case and screen protectors and a wireless charger to go with it, and then discovered when I put my SIM card in that it was locked. Now I have to decide if I want to try again and hope I get an unlocked phone this time, or pay twice as much for a new phone. Ugh."
"iPhone 12","Battery life lasts me all day since I do use my phone for work at Publix . It‚Äôs easy to login to all my accounts with face recognition and it came tempered glass screen protector best thing ever"
"iPhone 12","No dings or scratches, even has a screen protector. Battery at 87% capacity, other than that, the phone is perfect.

update - this phone is sim locked. The description says Fully Unlocked (Renewed)."
"iPhone 12","I was using an IPhone 6 so you can only imagine the joy I had when this started working for me all set up. Came exactly how I wanted it to"
"iPhone 12","The phone was dirty when I got it. It was almost like someone took a phone case off of it and then threw it in a box and sent it to me. All the speakers were visibly dirty. Functionally it worked great until I tried to make a call. The ear speaker did not work at all. I could use speaker phone and the speaker for music worked wonderfully. Also, the facial recognition only worked about half the time. Most the time I had to put in the pin to open it. This would have been my first apple phone in over a decade so I don't know if this would have gotten better if I rescanned my face or not because I only had the phone for a day. The return went very smoothly though and for that I give the company props."
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôve had this phone for 3 weeks now and the battery health has already gone down to 97% which is not normal for an iPhone 12. Especially if I‚Äôve only had it for 3 weeks. I have to pay $100 to get the battery replaced now. Not worth your money."
"iPhone 12","I would strongly advise a friend away from buying a renewed iphone. I ordered the 12, and will be returning it. The screen sensitivity is terrible. does not respond even as well as my 3 year old iphone6. Faulty hardware or software bug i guess. Has been a big headache for me."
"iPhone 12","i am going to return it not working right very disappointed"
"iPhone 12","Making phone calls and cancelling robo calls."
"iPhone 12","Order the phone so I can send to my dad in Jamaica. I bring the phone with me to Jamaica so I can give. after he received it he said that he can only use the phone on speaker. So many starches and the phone was so dirty. The battery life at 88%. This iPhone is no good and I spent so much money for it. Now my dad have to pay someone to get the phone fix. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!! WHY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR A GARBAGE PHONE. AND THEY SEND ME THE WRONG COLOR. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"
"iPhone 12","The front camera doesn‚Äôt work 95% of the time."
"iPhone 12","It came with three scratches and heats up a bit. The battery life is ok but could die slower"
"iPhone 12","Batterylife can not be rated at this time"
"iPhone 12","Worked well"
"iPhone 12","Great photo quality. Fast processing speed. Like the facial recognition. Quality product."
"iPhone 12","I do not recommend this equipment is terrible.- mine arrived with signs of misuse and bumps on all corners.- scratched never use it.- I returned it to the store.it's garbage.is a scam I stole 50 percent in the return . IS ESTAFFFAAAAAA"
"iPhone 12","No me lo entregaron con caja, y tiene alginos peque√±os rallones en la parte de atraz, fuera de eso parece que el telefono esta super bien"
"iPhone 12","I bought the phone and it came with 89% battery health. Pretty decent I would say. After finishing all the process and downloading the software update, I tried to play music just to check the speaker. The speaker was tearing up. When I called someone I couldn't hear them while on the hands-on phone calling and very low voice while on speaker.
It says certified but still got a defective product. Returning it on the first day."
"iPhone 12","This phone simply does not work. It came with issues from the get go. The screen and surroundings has dents in it like it has been dropped and mis treated. When i tried to set up the phone it will go from a black screen with a scroll wheel in the center to the home screen, back to the black screen. There is no way to make this phone work. We have spent all day researching online how to do a factory reset, but the phone wont even allow you to do that! Very frustrating and very annoyed."
"iPhone 12","Phone is in good quality except for one little scratch on the back. Battery health came at 100%. Runs smooth no problems. Came unlocked"
"iPhone 12","The phone arrived in inadequate packaging to protect the phone. There was nothing to cushion the phone or protect it from rough treatment in transit.

When I tried to use the phone, it worked only long enough to load all my personal information and then went black. Despite many attempts to charge it, retart it, etc., it will not turn on or operate. Very frustrating. The phone is clearly not functional."
"iPhone 12","Phone was described as excellent condition. I received a dirty scratched phone in fair/good condition. I‚Äôm frustrated by electronic resellers being so shady. Don‚Äôt buy, I don‚Äôt even trust the phone authenticity."
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12","The phone didn‚Äôt work. Thankfully, Apple replaced it. However, it cost me $32.00"

"iPhone 12","Phone was supposed to be unlocked. It was not. I was unable to activate. Had to reset to factory and return."
"iPhone 12","Has a lot of scratches and has a bad battery life dont but this."
"iPhone 12","Bought this renewed I phone. 5 months later the phone says locked to owner with the original purchasers icloud account. This company can't supply an original purchase receipt to unlock the phone with Apple and won't return or exchange the phone. $700 paperweight. Buyers beware."
"iPhone 12","todo de acuerodo a las especificaciones, muy conforme"
"iPhone 12","What a rip off, refurbished is too expensive considering I got an inferior scratched product, it was in my possession for 2 minutes when I saw the damaged screen, never even turned it on so don't know if it worked. Insult to injury I had to pay shipping costs to return! What a waste of time and money, I will buy new only."
"iPhone 12","Excelente"
"iPhone 12","I‚Äôm guessing this was B grade. This phone was hiding 3 scratches under the screen protector"
"iPhone 12","item did not come unlocked, wasn‚Äôt compatible with my sim, said it was locked by the carrier, unusable"

"iPhone 12","me lleg√≥ un telefono en muy mal estado f√≠sico y mala bater√≠a, no los recomiendo"
"iPhone 12","I mistakenly bought 2 phones with the hope that we wouldn‚Äôt get defective products. Boy, was I wrong. Took these in same day to our provider only to find out that not just one, but BOTH are sim locked. Without knowing the previous provider, we‚Äôre SOL. I started a return immediately after finding out that they can‚Äôt be used. This product is 100% a scam. If you decide to purchase these, don‚Äôt expect them to be unlocked. Just buy new so you know you‚Äôre getting exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to."
"iPhone 12"," Good condition work good battery life 100"
"iPhone 12","Perfecto estado"

"iPhone 12","Speaker doesn't work so I can't even face time. Called and was told the seller would send a label for me to return it, it's been a month and I never got it. So you're really gambling if you buy it from this shady person."
"iPhone 12","Phone is working fine"
"iPhone 12","Excellent"
"iPhone 12","This phone was scratched and came in a bad cardboard box with an android charger and the camera didn't work I couldn't charge it and it was such bad quality definitely known as refurbished this was the worst experience ever. It wouldn't connect with my carrier and for 700$ I was mad as all can get out please please save your money and don't buy this piece of junk."
"iPhone 12","I like so much"
"iPhone 12","Maybe I will revise this review later, but after waiting two days longer than anticipated, I received my phone with no instructions whatsoever. I guess I will go to my carrier tomorrow."

"iPhone 12","I bought this thinking it would be unlocked. Also my phone service provider wasn‚Äôt able to unlock it."

"iPhone 12","Charger port doesn‚Äôt work"
"iPhone 12","This is definitely not the quality I expected"

"iPhone 12","The display is amazing, very clear and durable. The battery life is for medium users, so 4-5 hours per day."
"iPhone 12","Amazon says the phone is 100% unlocked and I received a phone locked into a carrier. If I wanted to buy a locked phone, I would have went to the store physically. If you‚Äôre like me and want an unlocked phone DO NOT buy this one. Thumbs down double thumbs down"
"iPhone 12","This phone was a gift and advertised as refurbished. When we took it into our wireless carrier to activate it, we where shown several marks on the outside edge, a small chip in the screen and a slightly dirty charge port. Our wireless carrier said that if it is advertised as refurbished it is supposed to be like new. We didn't fully unpack the phone until we got to our provider because my daughter didn't want anything to happen to it before it was activated and put in a protective case."
"iPhone 12","No lo duden , es perfecto y con garant√≠a."
"iPhone 12","As my eyes have aged, reading on a small screen has become more difficult. My old 6 plus had a relatively large screen which made reading easy. The 12 is both shorter and narrower. I am not willing to pay for a 12 Pro Max which is bigger.

This is an Accessibility issue that affects millions of iPhone users. Apple could make the model 12 in different sizes with little effort.

Another solution would be for all news apps to support rotating the screen. Their text length then would be more reasonable with the slightly larger print that I need."
"iPhone 12","No issues with my phone! You'd never know that it was renewed. Very happy with my purchase and this seller. 10/10!"
"iPhone 12","A new Iphone 12 is $20 more! That‚Äôs all!! Why buy renewed??"
"iPhone 12","Liked the overall quality, sharp pictures and long battery life."

"iPhone 12","The shipping was fast and the phone is like it's brand new straight from the store. Zero scratches or defects. It came unlocked so I just put in my son's Cricket chip and the phone works amazingly. Good price for a nice device!!"
"iPhone 12","The reconditioned unit is like new and was a snap to set-up. It transferred all data from my Iphone 6 without a problem."
"iPhone 12","Battery dies fast, face recognition works sometimes and the charging port only works with certain chargers definitely needs improvement or lower the value of the phone because it‚Äôs not worth no where near a grand."
"iPhone 12","So far so Good! Phone came looking like brand new! No trouble activating or switching info. Fingers crossed!"
"iPhone 12","Phone was in perfect condition! It worked flawlessly on T-Mobile transferring over from my old iPhone."
"iPhone 12","So I was very skeptical at first about buying a refurbished phone but I was pleasantly surprised how good it was and ready to go! everything transferred over perfectly just be patient it takes some time to move all of the data especially if you have a bunch of photos to move."
"iPhone 12","Enhancement of the previous six were much smaller and functional but still looks the same with a enlarged pixel gripper like this one"
"iPhone 12","I bought the iPhone 12 from Refurb Supply Source. The phone was delivered in two days, and came in like-new condition with 100% maximum battery capacity.

"iPhone 12","I am shocked at the great condition that the phone is in being refurbished as well as the high battery life. This is my second phone purchased from this company over the last few years and they both have been great."
"iPhone 12","I got this phone at 86% battery health . Everything is perfect otherwise"
"iPhone 12","The newest IPhone. It feels good in the hand. It has boxed off sides. Face recognition works. I am pleased so far."
"iPhone 12","I spend so much money on this phone and from the beginning the wifi and bluetooth never would turn on. Now the phone keeps resetting randomly meaning idk when it will just shut off on me and for how long. This was meant to be in new condition but it had scratches on it but not something I really cared about. I just wanted a normal phone."
"iPhone 12","Son loves this purchase"
"iPhone 12","I always feel like I‚Äôm taking a chance buying ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù electronics but the prices on the new iPhones have led me to do this twice. And I‚Äôm glad I did! This phone arrived early, perfectly packaged, and included a charging cable and cube and a sim chip remover. The phone is in perfect condition with not even a tiny scratch to be seen. I‚Äôve been using it for several days now and it works great. Battery life on arrival was 98%‚Äîawesome! The only odd thing I noticed is about the Amazon listing. The price is fluctuating a lot. One day the phone was $519, still a reasonable price, but the next it was $420. So perhaps you want to keep an eye on that and time your purchase."
"iPhone 12","love itit is my fizt iphone ad i am samsung android guy but so fsr i love thiscompering to my frinds iphone 11 this is lot better"
"iPhone 12","-Phone has no 3.5mm jack-No wall charger is included in the box-Constantly and incessantly asks for Apple ID password, over and over, at random times, locking the Apple ID account without warning, notice, or reason, requiring email verified unlocks. One of the most frustrating user experiences I've ever had.-iTunes sync consistently fails to synchronize songs added, despite them showing up in iTunes and syncing. No warnings were displayed at all. This isn't helped by the fact that it's impossible to sort songs by date added in the music program. Wow.Unacceptable failures in design that, by 2022, should have been ironed out years ago. Oh, and the notch is annoying and hurts the design.3/5 stars."
"iPhone 12","Battery capacity is 89%. I wish it had a higher capacity, but it is okay for me to use anyway. Everything else was fine."
"iPhone 12","Super nice like new iPhone. Comes with a pin too. A couple of dollars off can get you a cup of coffee!"
"iPhone 12","Countless scratches on the back and bumps around the corners.Not even cleaned, let along ""renewed"". Totally a rip off.Can't wait to return it."
"iPhone 12","I bought my wife a gift and this was it. Buying something used always comes with its pros and cons. Overall the phone was great other than a little nick at the bottoms right if the screen and low battery health. The phone operates and normal overall."
"iPhone 12","This phone was a perfect upgrade from my XR. Face recognition is easy to use and reliable. Easy set up after transferring what I needed. This was as advertised and worth the price. I am happy with this phone and would buy again from this seller if needed."
"iPhone 12","I recently got one, I can't complain, the phone is brand new-like (clean) except for some few scratches on the side buttons but since I got it with the case is not even noticeable.I like it üòÅüòÅ"
"iPhone 12","Good"
"iPhone 12","I purchase an iphone 12 64GB renewed premium. Phone was like brand new and I couldnt tell it was used. The battery had 93% capacity was the only indication that it was not new. The phone came packaged in a Amazon Renewed Premium box and with a generic white charger, lightening cable and sim tray removal tool. I set up with US Mobile Super LTE sim and everything is working good so far."
"iPhone 12","I had checked up this iPhone and I expected a regular version and not a mini but it‚Äôs what I got. It has accepted my old sim from ATnT which I am happy with. I‚Äôm also happy that the iPhone was placed in my mailbox. Amazon has been losing my packages by their people leaving them at wrong doors so I was very stressed that I was going to lose my phone. So for that, you get a five star from me. Thank you."
"iPhone 12","It was a perfect gift for mu daughter"
"iPhone 12","This phone is like a 100% new phone!The quality is great. No scratchesBattery is 100%Phone guarantee is until Oct 24, 2021I can use Vietnamese sim card by this phone"
"iPhone 12","I am thrilled with this purchase. The phone is in pristine condition. Has great battery life and takes great photos. Also, came with glass protector. Experienced no problems in set up and has been working fine. I would most definitely purchase again when the time comes."
"iPhone 12","I bought this iPhone due to the fact that it was 100$ cheaper than the original sold by apple. I‚Äôve bought phones on Amazon in the past and have had no issue with them. However, when this phone came in the mail it was different. The phone turned on and functioned all right, but I soon noticed that it would restart over and over in a span of a 30 min use. This made the phone unusable. I went into the settings and found the warranty from the previous owner. Luckily, it was still under warranty. I took it to the shop and they had to basically replace the entire phone. I was really disappointed that I was sold a broken product. :("
"iPhone 12","Personal phone international pleaseüòä"
"iPhone 12","Phone was for my daughter. She loves it! The battery is much better than expected. She is very pleased with the camera. Great pictures. Well pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 12","I was a little concerned when I first started setting the phone up and it wouldn‚Äôt charge normally. It was plugged in for 4 hours and only got to 40%. I tried my old charger and it worked like a charm. The one they sent with the phone was shot. But- that‚Äôs the only down side and it‚Äôs not a big deal. The phone looks perfect, holds a charge very well, works like it came straight from Apple! I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase!! Five stars!"
"iPhone 12","Phone is in great shape and is working well. Had to get a different SIM card from ATT, as the iPhone 6 had a much larger SIM card, but we‚Äôre up and running with no issues."
"iPhone 12","Really great phone seems like brand new. Brand new battery. I‚Äôve been heavily using this phone for the past month no complaints."
"iPhone 12","buen producto gracias"
"iPhone 12","Estaba como nuevo , me encanto , funciona a la perfecci√≥n"
"iPhone 12","i was very scared reading the reviews after i bought the phone. the phone came in perfect. no visible scratches , everything works, it's unlocked. do it !!"
"iPhone 12","Battery is 100%, the body is perfect and the screen have a small scrat on the superior part, but it's very superficial.For a renewed iPhone deserves a 5 star."
"iPhone 12","I purchased the product on August 25th, and today October 16th midnight my girlfriend decided to changed the screen protector because the one that came with the phone makes a lot of finger prints, so once my girlfriend removed (it was actually a gift for my girlfriend) she noticed that there were several scratches on the screen that we didn't notice when we purchased the product ( I can't share pictures of it because we work on a cruise ship and the internet sucks on the open sea so I only can barely write reviews and purchases) I'm writing this now because we just noticed and in the product review said that the screen doesn't have scratches. I hope you guys be more honest with the description of your products next time so customers don't get this surprises after a month of purchase. I hope you can read my review. Thanks"
"iPhone 12","Renovado premium es la opci√≥n."
"iPhone 12","Dude en comprarlo por ser Reacondicionado pero hasta el momento muy bien. La condici√≥n de bater√≠a ven√≠a en 80% algo q no me gusto mucho pero lo mismo dec√≠a en la informaci√≥n del producto."

"iPhone 12","Hasta ahorita no heteido problema con el producto, siento que es nuevo y se ve prometedor, hasta este momento le doy 10/10 al vendedor y a las p√∫blicacion pues me lleg√≥ lo que esperaba"
"iPhone 12","El tel√©fono vino con 88% de bater√≠a hubiera preferido arriba del 90% pero est√° muy bien, solo tiene 2 detalles de los cuales solo 1 es realmente visible y con una funda no se ve ninguno, venia algo sucio pero nada del otro mundo, con cables de segunda mano pero de calidad decente,El √∫nico contratiempo es que veo 2 rayones en la pantalla, fuera de eso excelente."
"iPhone 12","Muy buen producto, es la primera vez que compro un Producto renew y se encuentra en condiciones impecables"
"iPhone 12","Esta perfecto"
"iPhone 12","Condiciones f√≠sicas muy buenas, sin da√±os considerables, muy ligeros rayones propios del uso. Funcionamiento excelente y condici√≥n de bater√≠a al 90%."
"iPhone 12","El equipo lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones con un par de golpes en las esquinas y rayones en los bordes de las c√°maras (las c√°maras est√°n en buenas condiciones y sin rayones en los cristales).La bater√≠a con un 87% de calidad, la pantalla sin rayones y todas las funciones operan de forma normal:Bocinas, micr√≥fono, WiFi, Bluetooth, Face Id, etc."
"iPhone 12","Me sorprendi√≥ mucho que la bater√≠a llegar√° en un 99%, el tel√©fono no presenta muchos detalles f√≠sicos pr√°cticamente un 9 de 10, en cu√°nto a su funcionamiento es muy bueno llevo una semana con el y no he tenido problema alguno, actualizar√© despu√©s para m√°s detalles..."
"iPhone 12","El celular viene bien, con un cargador gen√©rico y funcionando sin problemas.Solo tenia dos rayones en el marco de la esquina y bateria al 88%, pero la verdad por precio no me puedo quejar."
"iPhone 12","No est√° al 100 detalles est√©ticos pero pro el precio pasa"
"iPhone 12","Lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ y eso es con amazon quendice garant√≠a de 90 d√≠as de producto renovado y al mes ya no te da la opci√≥n de devolverlo"
"iPhone 12","Compr√© un iphone de estado ‚Äúaceptable‚Äù, pero en muy buen estado f√≠sico (la compra fue con clevercel). Bater√≠a con el 87% de vida, ninguna pieza modificada, s√≥lo unos raspones en las esquinas (se ocultan con una funda), y lo mejor 2k menos que los que dicen ‚Äúestado excelente‚Äù. Yo s√≠ recomiendo clevercel."
"iPhone 12","Tengo un mes con el celular, hasta el momento me ha funcionado muy bien, me llego bien cuidado con algunos peque√±os rayones que no se notan,la pila es de 89%, lo entregaron con cargador,cable,estoy muy satisfecha con la compra"
"iPhone 12","No viene con cargador."
"iPhone 12","Hice un estudio previo a la compra asi que el iPhone llego como se supone que llegan todos los Renewed, la caja en perfectas condiciones y con lo prometido. El telefono SI tiene signos asi que le dare en estetica un 9/10 tiene 3 ""picaduras"" en los marcos y un muy peque√±o raspon en el borde de la camara. La pantalla tiene muy pocos ara√±azos, nada que impida el uso de la pantalla ademas que el protector hace que se vea impoluto. La bateria llego en 90% y el cargador incluido es funcional a mas no poder, inclusive quise hacer la primer carga con un cargador rapido de Samsung y no quizo, solucion: usar el incluido generico. El software esta bien, la compatibilidad con la telefonica (Telcel) a la primera, 4G y 5G funcional, y todas las conexiones funcionales. En pocas palabras hice una prueba general que me llevo un dia y medio y nada fallo. La bateria no tiene problemas, la pantalla no tiene problemas, las camaras funcionan perfectamente. Creo que abriendo la mente a pensar que es un celular seminuevo te das cuenta que es una excelente compra y que te ahorraste un muy buen dinero."
"iPhone 12","Super√≥ todas mis expectativas, qued√© muy satisfecho con mi compra. Lleg√≥ al d√≠a siguiente. El iPhone ven√≠a bien empaquetado, con mica en la pantalla y cargador. Solo con unos peque√±os detalles en la c√°mara que realmente no se notan nada. Capacidad de la bater√≠a del 93%"
"iPhone 12","TODO BIEN, VINO EN CAJA GENERICA.. EN ESTETICA LE PONDRIA UN 9"
"iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Pues me gust√≥ ven√≠a con el 89% de bater√≠a ven√≠a en una est√©tica de 9 la verdad es que no parec√≠a usado muy bueno lo recomiendo, le√≠ algunos comentarios negativos me arriesgu√© pero sin duda alguna no me arrepiento"
"iPhone 12","Todo bien"
"iPhone 12","Con el dispositivo todo bien hasta el momento, solo que el cable para cargar venia mal... tendria que haber sido usb a lightning y me venia con un usb a usb tipo ""c""."
"iPhone 12","En general, el equipo est√° en muy buenas condiciones. La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° al 100%, est√©ticamente no tiene ning√∫n detalle ni en la parte trasera ni en los laterales y todo funciona perfectamente.

Lo √∫nico que no est√° en tan buena condici√≥n es la pantalla, que cuenta con algunos rayones visibles y que son m√°s profundos de lo que esperaba de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n del producto, pero debido a que lo dem√°s est√° en perfecto estado no me molesta.

En cuanto a los accesorios, no son originales; el cable me parece bueno pero el cargador si me parece de mala calidad por lo que no lo us√©. Adem√°s, el equipo ven√≠a con un cristal templado instalado, lo cual se agradece.

Definitivamente me parece una muy buena compra, con el √∫nico detalle de que la condici√≥n de la pantalla fue peor de la esperada."
"iPhone 12","Estaba un poco nerviosa de saber c√≥mo iba a llegar pero para mi sorpresa todo lleg√≥ en orden, y con bater√≠a condici√≥n al 100%, no me ha fallado en nada el iPhone, lo recomiendo ampliamente"

"iPhone 12","Para ser un equipo remanufacturado, est√° en buenas condiciones. La pantalla, sin rayones y el funcionamiento de hardware y software est√° bien. s√≥lo unos detalles m√≠nimos de est√©tica en la parte inferior. lleg√≥ bien empacado.
El √∫nico problema es que necesito factura y a la fecha el vendedor no la ha enviado despu√©s de varias solicitudes."
"iPhone 12","Excelente llego como nuevo y hasta con mica"
"iPhone 12","El producto lleg√≥ a tiempo y gran est√©tica , solo un peque√±o detalle en la parte de aluminio del tama√±o de la punta de una aguja. De ah√≠ en fuera como nuevo la pila al 100% ning√∫n ray√≥n visible en la pantalla. Viene con protector de muy buena calidad comet√≠ el error de ponerle uno y la calidad del touch bajo much√≠simo por eso me di cuenta que tenia doble mica termine quit√°ndole la otra. Trabaja de las c√°maras excepcionales cabe resaltar que ten√≠a el S20FE solo extra√±o poco el Zoom de 3x pero realmente se usa pocas veces. Estoy muy feliz con esta compra."
"iPhone 12","El equipo me lleg√≥ con el 100% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a y pens√© que la hab√≠an cambiado pero al revisar el serial es el mismo de f√°brica, solamente unos rayones en la pantalla y la tapa trasera que a simple vista no se ven de tienes que verlo a contra luz, de ah√≠ en fuera el equipo parece nuevo y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."

"iPhone 12","Llego con 90% de vida de bateria, tiene algunos rayones y detalles est√©ticos pero no se perciben a simple vista y no afectan en el rendimiento. Viene perfectamente limpio y con una mica de cristal templado."
"iPhone 12","Producto no es reconstruido como dise de echo es usado cargador no son originales caja no vino solo ven√≠a la caja de Amazon ven√≠a solo el tel√©fono , cheque la pila solo trai el 80% nada que ver con las foto que publico trai rayones en la parte de abajo y el display no es oled seg√∫n yo lo compre por que era reconstruido No usado , un poco desecionado üòî"
"iPhone 12","Tomando en cuenta que es un equipo USADO, esta muy bien bater√≠a al 90.Hablando del iPhone 12 red tiene un lado sin metal pero es normal por la edici√≥n"
"iPhone 12","It looks and operates like new, I am very pleased.I am amazed at how easily and fast it was transferring all my data and apps from my old iPhone 7 to this iPhone 12.Everything works like new."
"iPhone 12","El art√≠culo lleg√≥ bien, totalmente desbloqueado con est√©tica de 8/10 y con porcentaje de bater√≠a de 87%, hasta el momento a funcionado muy bien y la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a es buena"

"iPhone 12","Me gusto mucho, el color est√° bonito, vino en muy buenas condiciones y con 100% de bater√≠a"
"iPhone 12","Me toc√≥ un dispositivo con el 100% de salud de la bater√≠a, con unos rayones casi imperceptibles (no not√© los rayones cuando le puse mica) y funciona demasiado bien, fui a Apple a que le corrieran un test y todo sali√≥ s√∫per! Es seminuevo y desde mi experiencia muy recomendable!PD Tambi√©n ven√≠a con garant√≠a por 3 meses en Apple"
"iPhone 12","Simplemente lo mejor que pude haber comprado"
"iPhone 12","El producto lleg√≥ con 86 de bater√≠a , pantalla en estado implacable , ning√∫n solo ara√±azo, sorprende"
"iPhone 12","Ayer me lleg√≥ y va perfecto, no tiene detalles est√©ticos y venia con mica, la pila me vino con el 91%, lo seguir√© usando a ver como va pero es muy buen producto, original : ) igual a la imagen, recomiendo"
"iPhone 12","Comprado con el vendedor BuySPRY, el tel√©fono lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones, solo un rayo en la parte de arriba del tel√©fono, pero ya prendida la pantalla no se nota. Todo correcto y original; pantalla, bater√≠a, IMEI, n√∫mero de serie, todo en orden. La bater√≠a me lleg√≥ con un 99%. Buena compra."
"iPhone 12","Me llego a tiempo, me llego unos rasgu√±os pero muy superficiales, de bater√≠a me llego al 89% con mica, para el precio fue una excelente compra, el √∫nico pero que le pondr√≠a es que viene con cargador y cable gen√©ricos, pero de ah√≠ en m√°s todo est√° Perfecto"
"iPhone 12","El equipo llego el d√≠a que decia al momento de la compra. La vida de bater√≠a fue de 100%, lo cual me sorprendio mucho. Un par de detalles fisicos en el marco, pero para ser renewed esta muy bien.La caja y cargador pudieron ser mejores, pero de lo demas no hay queja."
"iPhone 12","El iPhone llego en buen estado, aunque como esperaba llego con cargador y caja gen√©rica. En cuesti√≥n de est√©tica le doy un 98% y la pila ten√≠a un 90% de vida. En general despu√©s de casi un mes de uso, todo muy bien!!"
"iPhone 12","Me lleg√≥ como si fuera nuevo, solo el cargador y el cable no eran los adecuados para este modelo"
"iPhone 12","Todo perfecto, solo un peque√±√≠simo ray√≥n en la parte lateral. Fuera de eso funciona excelente"
"iPhone 12","El producto est√° muy bien, me lo mandaron sin ning√∫n golpe, solo un muy muy leve rasgu√±, no visible a simple vista. Les recomiendo comprar el producto directamente con *Amazon internacional*, ya que te mandan una caja con los datos de que se reviso del equipo y la pila est√° casi nueva, y pues lo principal, es que 100% seguro que te env√≠en el tel√©fono que pediste"
"iPhone 12","Cumple con todas las expectativas"
"iPhone 12","Excelente servicio, r√°pido y seguro a la entrega. En muy buenas condiciones y muy buena est√©tica"

"iPhone 12","Esta padris√≠mo, no se noto que fuera reacondicionado, aunque con bater√≠a al 97%, y trae el cargador generico no es el original, de all√≠ en fuera estuvo excelente."

"iPhone 12","El equipo en buen estado solamente que no es lo que dice la descripci√≥n puesto que dec√≠a que era equipo libre pero ven√≠a con una sim de T Mobile, y estaba bloqueado por el operador al momento de ingresar mi sim de Telcel me mencionaba ese bloqueo de SIM inv√°lida, solicitar√© mi reembolso."
"iPhone 12","Compre un IPhone 12 reacondicionado con la teor√≠a que todo funciona a la perfecci√≥n pero no me deja ni configurarlo, no me deja pasar de la secci√≥n (selecciona tu pais o region ), por lo tanto lo devolver√©, les contare como me fue con la devoluci√≥n, saludos"

"iPhone 12","El celular lleg√≥ est√©ticamente bien, pero se reinicia sin ninguna raz√≥n a cada rato y parece tal cual lo regresan lo ponen a la venta sin rebizarlo realmente"
"iPhone 12","No sirvi√≥. El iPhone 12 que ped√≠ no funciono. Su estado era bueno, sin embargo nunca se pudo configurar, no se pudo actualizar y tampoco dej√≥ transferir los datos, lo que me hizo pensar si era ROBADO. Ya hab√≠a comprado anteriormente un iPhone 8 renovado y no tuve problema, pero este fue una total decepci√≥n.

Regres√© el tel√©fono y para evitar problemas mejor ya no lo volver√© a comprar."
"iPhone 12","El dispositivo ten√≠a multiples rayones en la pantalla y parte trasera, los bordes de las camaras principales se encontraban astillados.
En general, el articulo estaba muy maltratado."
"iPhone 12","No me lleg√≥ el producto, no es real la publicaci√≥n, ya proced√≠ a la devoluci√≥n pero a√∫n no me responden!"
"iPhone 12","Su bater√≠a ya no dura casi"

"iPhone 12","P√©simo producto lo devolv√≠ aun sigo esperando mi reembolso"
"iPhone 12","Llego en perfecto estado a pesar de ser Reacondicionado, primer equipo que compro y sin problema."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was brand new! Battery health of 100% perfect condition!
The only problem was that when I logged in my Apple ID, my data was stolen and purchases were made on my card within a few minutes."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came the morning after I ordered even though It was suppose to come a week later, everything came as described without a scratch,
the phone was at 100% max battery. Best purchase I‚Äôve ever made on Amazon, definitely worth it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Item is exactly as stated in the seller description. Love the size! Didn't use facial recognition so can't rate it. Got all the features and no scratches on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","So at first I was sketched out because it came in a box that was like for a phone I‚Äôve never seen before but I opened it and was super excited. I mean it had a cube and charger and the phone was in perfect condition. It even had a screen protector on it which was cool. But I‚Äôm very excited and hope this helped!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived actually unlocked and worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in, which after a long struggle with carriers and phones was a big relief. I can't speak on the facial recognition because I don't use it, but it seems like a like-new phone to me."
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone on sale on early access day and I chose to pay a little extra for the higher standard refurbished version. When I received it everything was good except there was an area on the screen that had several scratches. It is advertised as being scratch free with 90% battery but mine was scratched. My only recourse is to return it, not exchange it, meaning I lose the sale price."
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought for my daughter's 11th birthday and she loves it. Fast shipping great quality picture is beautiful and the mint color is gorgeous üñ§"
"iPhone 12 mini","I order one from this shipper. It came with a malfunctioning screen and a notification on apple that the screen was not supported.
They don‚Äôt appear to do exchanges, so I had to return the first one and buy another.
Second try got one that works."
"iPhone 12 mini","ok so like most people buying a renewed from from amazon, I was a bit skeptical. However, when I got the phone in the mail I have to say I shocked. okay it wasn't packaged the best but it came with a SIM card remover, brand new charger, and a box which apple no longer provides. everything is working perfectly but when I unboxed the phone I noticed a pretty deep scratch on the bottom of the phone. I was a bit turned off but I had to remind myself that its a used phone that was half the price of a new one. overall im happy with my purchase and the scratch is no big deal just caught me off guard"
"iPhone 12 mini","ty for this phone i love it. its a pretty blue i love and its a great phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was in Need of a new phone but couldn‚Äôt afford it brand new. I was concerned refer bisher wasn‚Äôt legit, but this phone is good as new and has been everything I needed. I have had no problems and I have had my phone for two or three months now."
"iPhone 12 mini","I like the fact that the battery health is 100%. It just have few hair line scratches and bumps on the corners. I am not very picky so for me it's ok. It is still very useful and usable. And it really came with the latest OS update when it came to me. For the price I pay for it, it is worth it. üòÅ"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone because my trusty iPhone8 was failing on me.
This is a good phone and there's no question about that. I use most of the features and like them.
Just one observation: while the mini form factor was great in its time, and I thought I would stay with it, I have the sense that app designers are making use of more screen real estate in their designs, and that the mini design is less than adequate today. Typefaces seem to be getting progressively smaller, and links are harder to hit.
My sense is that I should have gone with the now standard form factor rather than the mini, and I assuredly will for my next phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini looks and functions perfectly, battery maximum performance is 84% but that‚Äôs to be expected for a two year old iPhone. The battery still lasts for about a day on a charge. $340 for a unlocked phone in excellent condition is a great deal, I think."
"iPhone 12 mini","Wasn't disappointed."
"iPhone 12 mini","No issues what so ever."
"iPhone 12 mini","It is so nice to have an option to have an iphone without the insane price tag! it came in perfect condition and you wouldve never guessed that it was used!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini for 400$ battery was at 100% life out of the box not a single scratch or dent this is my second time buying from Amazon renewed I would definitely recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Like some of the other reviewers, I had concern about the condition of a 'renewed' phone. As it turned out, it arrived in perfect, like-new condition. No observable defects, no observable wear/scratches/scuffs even when looking closely, not at arms length as Amazon mentions.

Using the iOS battery health app, the battery health was at 100% when I received it. Amazon advertises that the phone will arrive with at least 80% battery health. To check, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health and then look at Maximum Capacity. If it shows up in problematic condition, Amazon covers it with a generous 90 day return policy. I suspect that the one I received was an 'instant regret' purchase by the original owner and returned immediately. It seems likely that most 'renewed' phones will have some battery degradation so expecting battery health to be at 100% is unrealistic.

The only issue I had was not related to this phone. Call sound quality wasn't good and drop outs. After doing a network reset, that was fixed. Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset Network Settings > enter your passcode and then Reset Network Settings (red letters). Your phone will reboot. You'll have to log on to your wifi network again and if you have a VPN, you may have to set that up again. After doing this, no drop outs and good sound quality. Note that the network reset process changed after the iOS 15 update. Going forward, the sequence above may change again.

Amazon's refurb department did a great job of cleaning, wiping the previous installation of iOS and repackaging it. Regardless, I did a complete reset before restoring from a backup. This probably isn't necessary but it brought some peace of mind knowing that It was a clean installation of iOS.

It arrived in a well designed aftermarket box designed for cell phones, an Apple charger, Apple cable and an aftermarket screen protector of the type used for shipping protection. They mention that it may come with an aftermarket charger and cable so don't expect Apple branded accessories.

Presumably most people purchasing the iPhone 12 Mini will have informed themselves of the pros and cons of this model (ahem..battery life). I'd guess that most will not find battery life to be an issue. For heavy users and for those that regularly use high drain features such as GPS navigation, it would be advisable to have charging capability in the car and at work.

The only thing I'd add is that if you want the leather MagSafe case from Apple, keep an eye on prices. It usually sells for 60 dollars but the black one was on sale in Amazon at the time of this writing for 23.99 + tax. Instant purchase and on the way.

I used an Apple leather case with an iPhone 8. I was satisfied with its basic protection, feel and handling. Its unlikely to provide as much drop protection as an Incipio Duo and other cases designed with drop protection in mind but 23.99 + tax was hard to pass up.

Happy customer, solid purchase for an unlocked iPhone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","I am not a fan of Apple products but needed this phone to work with other systems. The battery capacity was 88% out of the box (meaning 88% of the battery was functional and at full-charge (a reading of 100% after charging) meant it's full capacity of 88% was reached). I bought this refurbished so I was not expecting a full-capacity battery load. With that said:
* I downloaded @ 8 of my favorite apps and removed/closed down a number that came with the phone that I would never use
* Leaving the phone on without any frequent use, the battery charge lasted 3-4 days (@ 72-96 hours). I have not put it to the test of typical use phone/web/streaming use yet
* The set-up was uncharacteristically simple and without a glitch - very surprising and greatly appreciated
* Facial recognition has been perfect so far
* My other phones have been large in size - but I thought I would try this ""mini."" Again, to my surprise - I really like it. I can hold and operate the keyboard with one hand - and small hand at that. It is very lightweight and easily fits into a pants pocket.

So far, so good - very pleased."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love the small size and the color because I can see it wherever I lay it down."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in excellent condition!! Looks brand new. Very happy I ordered."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was very skeptical about buying a phone online that was cheap like this for the phone I was getting. I read the reviews and my mind was a little more at ease. I got the phone earlier than it said which I was happy about. And the phone is in perfect condition it‚Äôs got good battery life. It‚Äôs like I bought it new from the store. I definitely recommend this product."
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno. Tiene una peque√±a marca en una esquina. La bater√≠a est√° al 88%."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs perfect. I got it mainly got the size. But runs great. No issues. No scratches 100% battery.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for 8 months then the earpiece speaker stopped working. No help from the seller at all"
"iPhone 12 mini","bueno"
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value, too bad my wife dropped the phone in the toilet"
"iPhone 12 mini","I have been using this phone for just over a week now and it is just like new. Performs great, excellent battery life (may I also add 100% battery health out of the box!), responsive touch screen, great camera, fast Face ID, the list goes on. Only minor imperfection I notice is a very small scratch to the right of the screen glass (not on the screen glass) in the bottom-right corner. Otherwise, the device looks and works like it was just bought directly from Apple. If you are looking for a like-new modern iPhone on the cheap, this is one of the best money can buy.

TL;DR: exactly like new with the exception of a minor scratch, would highly recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","AMAZING GET IT!!!!!! The battery capacity is 100 and works so nice"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. It was in perfect condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is in pretty good shape for being refurbished. There‚Äôs some cosmetic damage do the exterior of the case, but I use a protective case anyway, so that‚Äôs not visible.
I‚Äôm disappointed that they didn‚Äôt put a new battery in it. The battery health is only at 85%, which means I‚Äôll have to have it changed soon. I feel like a refurbished phone should come with a new one."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great. Just what I was looking for. Good price."
"iPhone 12 mini","One afternoon I picked up my good old 6s and discovered...a brick. I needed a new (to me) phone quickly, so I ordered a renewed/refurbished 12 Mini. I live in the sticks, so overnight delivery just doesn't happen, but I was happy with 2nd day delivery. I find the 12 Mini is a good size for my hand."
"iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto me agrad√≥ que lleg√≥ como nuevo y con cargador de carga r√°pida"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks brand new, not a single scratch, and 100% battery health. But weird things have been happening.

First, I couldn‚Äôt activate this phone with my career‚Äôs online tool‚Äî one where you log into your account and enter the phone‚Äôs IMEI. This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process.

Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren‚Äôt on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version.

The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978. See screenshot.

I‚Äôve read that this is done by Apple to identify ‚Äúgray market‚Äù devices, devices refurbished by unauthorized resellers, and iPhones that were demo units.

This makes me wary that this phone may have been tampered with, compromised, or hacked.

Like I said it is cosmetically in perfect condition, I was even impressed! But I have to return this phone and buy brand new for my peace of mind.

Since it might just be my paranoia, I‚Äôm only knocking off one star. This renewed phone is for someone, just not me."
"iPhone 12 mini","Over all it's like new. The only one issue, is that there is a small scratch on the glass. If it didn't have that scratch, I would have given it 5 stars."
"iPhone 12 mini","I read some of the reviews about some of their other products and was skeptical but when I got the phone it was basically like new. No scratches, the battery life was 100%, no dents or anything. Thank you, I needed the phone really bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","I liked that the phone looks really good and looks brand new. What I did not like is that the battery is at 89% but it doesn‚Äôt matter to me"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine in every detail, except battery life is not quite as long as desired."
"iPhone 12 mini","Ignore the smudges on the second photo, those are not scratches.

My boyfriend wanted a newer phone, we were nervous, we bought it anyway. The condition of this phone is AMAZING. He ordered the 64GB, blue. There are roughly 6 cosmetic issues and I don‚Äôt even want to call them cosmetic issues. They‚Äôre so tiny on the back of the phone, it looks like someone took a sewing needle and simply POKED the phone. They aren‚Äôt even noticeable unless you‚Äôre deliberately checking for imperfections and the phone is practically on your nose. I‚Äôve seen worse done with brand new phones from shipping.

Now, the new iOS updates allows you to go into settings to find non genuine parts like displays, batteries, cameras, etc. This phone doesn‚Äôt pop for a SINGLE off brand part. Every single part in this phone seems to fully check out to apple or simply have not even been replaced.

I even went farther and logged into my apple support. The phone was first purchased in 2020, and hasn‚Äôt had a single pop up there for unauthenticated parts either. Further boosting us into loving the idea that this phone is all Apple.

The camera works perfectly and the battery health is at 84% which is a great health rate for him, and a used phone in general.

The phone was also entirely unlocked. I didn‚Äôt have to pay anything to turn it on, I was able to use my old SIM card, and it was fully set up to my carrier MOMENTS after restarting the phone.

The only thing I didn‚Äôt check was the light in the sim port for water damage. But with how wonderful this phone is, I‚Äôm not even bothering taking the sim back out to check.

Extremely lucky buy, or extremely great sellers. Who knows, but we‚Äôre thankful.
Whoever this phone was bought from, amazing person. Whoever ‚Äúfixed‚Äù this phone, amazing person. We couldn‚Äôt be happier purchasing this. Especially it being the first time we bought refurbished, ever."
"iPhone 12 mini","So it‚Äôs a refurbished phone alright.

My complaints are‚Ä¶. Lines in the screen on a white background, phone over heats easily, and some people say they can‚Äôt hear me clearly on calls.

I like‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs battery is solid.
(I went from an iPhone 6, to a iPhone 12)

I think you can find a better phone for cheaper on other sights. I probably wouldn‚Äôt go this route again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in excellent like new condition, battery is decent, 87% maximum capacity. Everything works as it should."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my little phone. It‚Äôs paid for and mine idc who had it before me lol."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was in desperate need of a new phone for a few months as my iPhone 8 was suffering from a broken charging port (wireless was the only way I could charge) and excessive battery drainage. Instead of dealing with my phone retailer and getting a new payment plan I decided to just buy this and put my current SIM card in.

The phone came in generic packaging with generic charging accessories. But I was able to transfer my data from my old phone to this one within an hour of receiving it.

The phone came with very very minor scratches on the back glass which isn‚Äôt an issue at all. Functionality was perfect, it felt like having a brand new phone. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the battery‚Äôs life was not at 100% so it does drain about halfway to 50% when I don‚Äôt charge it for about 10~ hours. Overall a great quick option if you need a new phone fast with no hassle."
"iPhone 12 mini","my phone came in almost pristine condition. so far, i have seen no problems that are super obvious. there are some scratches on the screen but not noticeable unless you specifically look for it under light. the battery condition came at 89% so it was pretty decent. i‚Äôm really happy with what i got! it looks pretty much like new and everything works perfect too!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good. Only I don‚Äôt receive any key for Sim card removal"
"iPhone 12 mini","I picked 64gb cause I used to have 32 and oh my gosh it‚Äôs a life changer!! Any way the touch screen is really good the face recognition is spot on!!! And the battery life I just can‚Äôt start or this would be a 500 paged SA lol but overall it‚Äôs the best I really recommend and there wasn‚Äôt even a scratch on it üòÑ"
"iPhone 12 mini","Definitely worth the buy bought it for my lil bro he now uses it and there hasnt been any issues it is unlocked because now he‚Äôs not in the US and it works just fine with other Carriers"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this phone as a gift for someone. The person was super happy. Very good condition. Delivery was great."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with only 83 percent battery life how is this renewed. Scratched and dings and the screen is not OEM!"
"iPhone 12 mini","actually unlocked, thankfully. good quality. will update if i find anything wrong with it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ok!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The response time of the screen is a bit slow. I do not know why. Also, the processor is slow too. I have had Iphone SE 2 until september, which was way faster than this, and had a much better screen response time."
"iPhone 12 mini","At first I couldn‚Äôt find my package, but the phone is amazing, works 100%."
"iPhone 12 mini","I recommend the phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Item was shipped quickly. It was as described no scratches or cosmetic damage at all. Only negative if I had to put one down is when I checked battery condition it checked out at 94%. Still good but that‚Äôs the only reason I did not give a 5 star for the whole review. If I had the option I probably would put a 4.5 stars."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs a real apple iPhone so that‚Äôs a start. However, the battery life is meh and it overheats quite fast when in the car as I‚Äôm driving so I keep it in my lap that seems to help. Nevertheless, it works and that‚Äôs what I was hoping for when I bought it. Better than my SE maybe"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting delivery of my iPhone 12 mini until Friday; it came in the mail Wednesday, to my delight! With the exception of a little bit of dust lodged in the phone‚Äôs Silent Mode switch and in the earpiece grille, the phone looked like new, came wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap, and also came with a Lighting cord and a neat little charging brick, similar to the ones Apple makes. Battery capacity was at 87% which is not too far off from mint condition. I set up my phone, synced my iCloud information, inserted my SIM card, and I was good to go!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Got the phone, it works great, other than some IOS related software bugs and issues (when setting the phone up) it's great! I selected the ""good"" quality option when I purchased. There ARE some scratches and dents in the frame, none in the screen, to show you how big they are a photo is attached (the one in the picture by the charging port is one of the biggest ones I've found) battery came 87% original capacity and unlocked with all carriers, face ID works wonderfully"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good condition. So far everything works good."
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratches at all, the camera and sound if perfect. Battery is 85%"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was debating weather or not I wanted to write this. However I know how important it was for me to see real reliable reviews so here it is‚Ä¶This review is going to be about the quality of product they sent me. Not the phone itself but I will cover that too.First impressions,Came very poorly packaged. I was really worried the phone was going to be broken or just horrible. The phone was only protected by a small box. The phone was loose in the box and it was only protected by a bit of bubble wrap. I took the phone out and immediately I wasn‚Äôt impressed. The phone was dirty like really dirty. I took about 5 minutes of wiping it down until I was satisfied. Then I noticed the scratches‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me.Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I‚Äôd highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It‚Äôs worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable.Battery life is amazing. I‚Äôm a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false. I use Max brightness for about 7 hours on screen time and I still go to bed with around 20% battery."
"iPhone 12 mini","Blue tooth doesn‚Äôt work"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone, thinking it was a big risk with it being renewed. The day I got the phone, it came with the original screen protector and a charging cable. I loaded it up and it had 100% battery life and was very snappy. I will be doing this again when I need another phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","At 75 years old changing from an iPhone 6 to a 12 Has had its challenges but overall I found it pretty simple to set up. I have not carried a purse and years so I did not want to go to a bigger screen than I had to. The 12 mini still fits very well in my pocket and I like it very much. I‚Äôm still learning to navigate around, not having a home button is a bit different but I think I‚Äôm doing pretty good overall"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone, only issue is a heavy dent on a corner. It gets cover with the case. Still worth the value."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well overall but the phone was pretty dinged up around the edges"
"iPhone 12 mini","It will be 60 degrees out and HOT when plugged in and gives error message. I have done all recommendations of closing all programs, restarting etc. Nothing helps."
"iPhone 12 mini","The main reason I purchased used was because my last phone was a broken iPhone 6s Plus I received as a gift to repair. I repaired the screen, speaker, front and rear cameras, and battery and the phone became like new.Fast forward a few years and now that iPhone 6s Plus has become very dated. I took the risk of buying a renewed iPhone 12 mini because of 3 reasons: about the same usable screen size as iPhone 6s Plus; the much lower cost (~$200 cheaper than new); and I was confident that I could do some repairs on it if it were to fail. Received the phone ahead of the delivery date and it came with a USB-A Lightning cable (and I think a power brick, but I don't remember). There was just one very minor scratch on the front glass that is only noticeable with the screen off and if you really paid attention. Battery was over 90% max capacity and still lasts me the whole day.Very satisfied with the purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product well packaged, quickly delivered. Accurately described and ‚Äúworks like new‚Äù. Would definitely buy refurbished from this seller again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything seems to work fine so for my only issue is that it did not come with a SIM card tryna and without that I can‚Äôt activate the phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","The back camera glitches when I go to take a photo. It never focuses on what I click on or if I simply put the camera on a object it makes a weird noise and loses focus. This is very annoying and stops me from taking and videos or pictures."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is an upgrade for me from XR. So worth it! No scratches or dents. The battery life lasts 2 with lighter use. can't find one thing wrong with it. Very pleasantly surprised. It even arrived 2 days earlier than estimated. The camera in this little phone is amazing as well. I am very happy with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","I would like the battery to have a higher percentage of charge, I received it with 87%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came in absolute perfect condition! The only problem was when I went to activate it with AT&T, they said it was blocklisted and suspended because the phone was reported as stolen 7 months ago. I had to return and buy a new phone. The new phone wasn‚Äôt stolen!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone as described excellent seller would definitely do business with AGAIN!!!! I personally like the smaller screens.most phones look like your carrying your T.v. set with you. I don‚Äôt need a 72 inch screen for a phone. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for Apple to get a phone that‚Äôs in my wrist or something a little more futuristic anyway. Until then this will do! Maybe look through Steve Jobbs old notes and come up with something different Apple your look/style is about 5 years past due. This is a 5 star seller thank you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","What a great way to save money and update my phone! I have had my Amazon Renew iPhone for about a month and have had no issues, works great and arrived just as described. Very pleased with my purchase!"
"iPhone 12 mini","it came in amazing condition and it looks brand new the battery came in 100% battery health!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Esperaba mas vida util de la bateria, por el precio que pague, y la condicion seleccionada al comprar. Esteticamene OK, funcional OK , y Face ID OK."
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm always a little nervous about buying refurbished electronics after getting burned once. But this phone has exceeded my expectations. Other than a small scratch on the screen that isn't even noticeable unless at just the right angle in the light, this phone is pristine. The blue color is beautiful, and the mini is just the right size for me, as I was upgrading from a iPhone 7.PROS:Transferring my info from the previous phone was quick and easy. I just sat them next to each other, and the phone did all the heavy lifting. Sound quality is good, and apps open quickly and run efficiently. It took a little getting used to not having the fingerprint ID and home button, but the face ID is almost instantaneous. Photos are fantastic, and the detail is amazing. I have yet to learn all the new features, but the low light pictures are much improved, especially of storms. Voice recognition and autocorrect in text messages seem to be more accurate than my 7 as well.CONS:At times it is a little sluggish to wake up. It takes a couple tries before it swipes open. And Siri seems to have more difficulty understanding me or giving me accurate answers, but maybe it takes some time for it to get used to my voice.Overall, I am very pleased with this phone for the price. It's still higher than I like to pay, but refurbished was much cheaper, and it was a long past-due upgrade."
"iPhone 12 mini","We tried Backmarket twice for a refurbished phone and did not have much luck and had to return both. Tried Amazon and it was perfect."
"iPhone 12 mini","El tel√©fono me lleg√≥ impecable pero era m√°s peque√±o de lo que cre√≠a, as√≠ que lo devolv√≠."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am surprised at how quick it arrived. The battery was at 94%. It was exactly as described. Thank you for a perfect transaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love love love my new phone. I always got really cheap phones because they‚Äôd break but now that I‚Äôm in a better place in my life this was a great deal for me to get the AT&T option which took my nano sim from my Alcatel. It was only $433 for the red att. No blemishes even except where the last person must‚Äôve dropped it maybe tiniest chip of the red there. The battery capacity lasts me all day long that‚Äôs what was wrong with my Alcatel it would charge and I would be worried in cities because it would die even charging. The iOS 15 added amazing updates. I got the zagg elite screen protector and can‚Äôt tell any difference in my visuality it‚Äôs easy to peel off the first couple tries and get rid of any air bubbles. The spigen case is amazing too beat priced case and doesn‚Äôt overlap the screen. Renewed is the way to go this tax season y‚Äôall"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works perfect as advertised very satisfied"
"iPhone 12 mini","It took me 3weeks for it to be activated with my carrier. Even though the phone was through them."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs a good phone but it came with a 86% battery health"
"iPhone 12 mini","Me agrado todo menos el precio y la novedad de que se oscurece la pantalla"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought 2 phones, one white and one blue, and both were in perfect condition. They look like brand new phones just pulled out of the Apple box. They both work like new. Set up was soooo easy. I understand not all purchases will be perfect through the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù process however, Amazon promises a 90 day return for all purchases if they don‚Äôt meet your standards. We are both very happy with our ‚Äúnew‚Äù phones!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It was pretty good quality for a great price they even answer back pretty fast. shipping was great 2 day earlier!! they get 4 stars for that !! Now my only issue was when I got it it was locked now that was anyoing but it happens so I understand I figure out how to unlock it myself and they texted they would help me to unlock so if that case ever arrives you should be fine other than that it was a fantastic buy Amazon thx üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought iPhone 12 mini (excellent condition). However, it has some scratches on it"
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone looks almost new without any visible scratches or dents. The battery capacity is at 87% well within the product descriptions. This iPhone costs close to $200 less than a new phone. Amazon will finance the phone with no interests via there VISA."
"iPhone 12 mini","I like the camera quality"
"iPhone 12 mini","Brand new, refurbished where?"
"iPhone 12 mini","The product arrived in good condition and had no visible defects, although the display was slightly dirty. The phone works perfectly and setup was simple. However, after only a couple hours of use it was clear that the phone was nearly unusable due to the battery life. Although the stated battery capacity in the settings was above the specification in the product description (87%), actual usage showed far worse battery life. After only 2.5 hours of screen time of non-intensive activities, such as messaging and playing music, the battery had dropped from 67% to 4%. Additionally, sometimes when I checked the battery the percentage would have dropped 3-5% after only a couple of minutes. I also tried suggested ways to improve battery use, such as turning off 5G and background refresh, but none of these worked. I'm very disappointed as I was excited to get this phone at a reasonable price, but this was not up to the standards promised by the seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 Mini arrived with a small chip on the corner which is obscured by any normal phone case. Other than that perfect physical condition. Maximum battery life was at 80%. Other than that just like a new phone! Very happy with my purchase and glad to buy renewed. Would recommend to anyone looking to save $200-$300 on a phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone isn‚Äôt good condition face recognition works battery life is pretty good and the touchscreen as well everything works excellent"
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs almost like new, but so much easier to hold and carry than my older iPhone XR. I‚Äôm very happy with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm happy with my new iPhone 12 mini but I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in UPS. The family was out for the day so naturally UPS left the package in my garage but they didn‚Äôt set it up high enough and a dog got ahold of the package. My brand new renewed phone now has a crack in the screen from the dog biting it. Luckily the phone is okay and the crack isn‚Äôt too bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","Even refurbished phones can look and run like brand-new I was kinda nervous because I‚Äôve always had issues with refurbished new homes‚Ä¶but mine and my son‚Äòs both were refurbished and you can‚Äôt even tell they are refurbished I just absolutely love them. amazing and have not given us any issues one bit so to sometimes put a little money back in your pocket go refurbished just look at all the details and everything and just go for the refurbished one because it will save not only money but you are still getting what you want and sometimes yes it doesn‚Äôt come in the original box but you are still getting what you want‚Ä¶for a lot cheaper tho so I will always shop on Amazon for everything including phones and will continue to give five stars everything I buy.!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent cosmetic appearance, battery life is at 80% which is in their stated range. Looks good to me."
"iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llego como indican en la descripci√≥n, algunas personas tuvieron suerte y les llego a un 100% condici√≥n de bater√≠a, en mi caso fue 89% y bueno creo que puedo vivir con eso, siendo un equipo renovado, con lo dem√°s todo estuvo perfecto."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone to buy outright. Don‚Äôt have monthly payments to worry about and I can choose what service I want. The touchscreen was a little sensitive at first. The face recognition is useful for not having to remember passwords. The battery doesn‚Äôt last long if you‚Äôre a power user so I would opt for the bigger ones next time. But great phone overall."
"iPhone 12 mini","Both phones I bought I purposely purchased from Decluttr Store after reading their reviews. They both were shipped and arrived quickly, both unlocked, 256 GB, and had no issues at all. One of the phones I got even still has a warranty on it. I also checked to make sure they were not stolen, and they were not. The phones themselves are great. I watched a guy online drop one like 10x from 9FT without a case on it and it survived fine. Sure I purchased a case and glass protector but I probably don't need either. I went from a 7 plus to this phone and really like how small it is. It reminds my of my old SE (the first edition). I would buy through Amazon again granted it's from a legit seller. Thanks again."
"iPhone 12 mini","no cracks or chips or scratches"
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone is in perfect conditions with 88% of health battery that it‚Äôs ok!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for the money, I had almost no scratches on the phone, at least that I could find, so for the look of the phone I would give it a 9/10, also with face recognition there are no problems, it works well and quickly, but it has a very bad battery, every week the battery deteriorates by 1%, so I don't know how it will perform in a few months, but so far I have no problems, so decide for yourself whether to buy it or no."
"iPhone 12 mini","Solid phone, very good, no noticeable scratches or scuffs, although a bit loose in the box it was perfectly fine once I opened it. It was provided with a cord and box and the only nit pick is that the battery life was at 95%Other than that it was definitely worth buying here and saving $200 rather than paying an extra 200 for the same phone, a box and 5% more battery life from apple"
"iPhone 12 mini","don't like that you can't be on YouTube the same time while you're browsing the Internet."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is my favorite model iPhone and fits in pocket. Battery easily lasts through the day. Face recognition is not great if you‚Äôre lying on your back."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting a like new product this phone, but based on Amazon‚Äôs description of their Renewed program (‚Äúprofessionally inspected‚Äù and ‚Äúexpertly refurbished‚Äù are two of the claims you see immediately when you browse their Renewed inventory) I expected the phone to be in better shape than it is. The screen is broken in a couple places and will need a replacement right away. I gave two stars because the phone is functional but I am disappointed that it didn‚Äôt have at least an intact screen. I did expect some physical imperfections on a refurbished product, but I feel like the screen is one of those things that really should be in good order, even when purchasing a refurbished product because of all the damage that can happen to a phone when the screen is not intact."
"iPhone 12 mini","Although this I-phone doesn't use the fingerprint to lock and unlock, the facial recognition is nice but it sometimes unlocks when I prefer it doesn't unlock, nor does it have the center button. There is a bar that appears at the bottom of the screen that does what the button used to do. To view which windows are open, just hold the bar and drag the window to the center of the screen and all open windows are visible. To close unwanted windows (which will also log you off an open account like a bank account), slide the screen up until it disappears. Lots of nice features that come with the phone and the camera takes much better pictures than my much older I-phone 5. Battery life lasts SOO much longer, too. I also appreciate the slightly larger screen, and the phone isn't much bigger than the i-phone 5. I love my new (refurbished) phone! It works great!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Had some problems on the post office side where the phone got sent back. They were super quick when I notified them of the problem and they resent the phone. Thank you for the great customer service!"
"iPhone 12 mini","People might say this is broken or useless I bought this for my son for his birthday and the phone was in perfect condition it had some fingerprints but it was alr and it still was 100% battery and no dents or no bad condition it's in perfect condition person who delivered it hand it to me so it was safe"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works well"
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôve never owned a brand new car. Nearly new, under 50K miles‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the way to go. I am now of the same mindset with iPhones. For $500 less than list price, I bought an iPhone 12-mini with 128 gb and it‚Äôs a great phone. I‚Äôm really happy with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","didn‚Äôt like it, I expected at least the battery life with 95%"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is fully unlocked, it worked perfectly in Ecuador and everything was perfect, as a new one."
"iPhone 12 mini","Quede muy incomforme, muy peque√±o y adem√°s me env√≠an un cargador disfuncional y un clip de papeler√≠a (ni siquiera un original)"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone was almost like new.i am very happy with the phone.i feel it was a good feal."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived within the provided timeframe. It was in great condition and fully functional as advertised. It had great battery life remaining and it was reasonably priced compared to the same type of phone being sold on Amazon by other sellers. The seller responded quickly to our questions."
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno practico"
"iPhone 12 mini","In the reviews they are saying that battery is going the whole day, it‚Äôs not. Middle of the day it will be %30 percent, it is almost impossible to use it for whole day.*i don‚Äôt play games"
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition; would recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini off Amazon and I was really worried about buying phones online but I would have to say it was works like brand new. It came in a regular shipping box with a cheap charger. I only wished I had got an original iPhone charger but it still works just as any would. The battery life is good. I was worried with it being a renewed phone that the battery life would suck but it‚Äôs actually pretty decent for now. Will update if I have any future problems. But I would suggest this sale to anyone. It‚Äôs so worth it. It‚Äôs slick. Small and easy to handle"
"iPhone 12 mini","Espero dure es mi primera vez comprando celular en Amazon se ve de buena calidad en perfectas condiciones me vino esta precioso"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is great just like buying from the apple store"
"iPhone 12 mini","I wanted a small smartphone so I decided on this one and I am happy that I bought. It has all the features as the larger one but at a smaller size. The color is nice and what can I say , its a iPhone and is a great phone with a operating system that I like. All in all I am happy that I purchased the iPhone 12 Mini."
"iPhone 12 mini","the battery capacity of the phone is at 83%. basically needs to be replaced which is what im dealing with now... wish i would have known this was the case to begin with - i dont think i would've bought it. Otherwise the phone is in decent condition - everything seems to work."
"iPhone 12 mini","The renewed product was in a nice package when it arrived. The phone itself has one or more dots on the edges of the phone that indicates the iPhone is used. Having used the phone for a week, it has been running good."
"iPhone 12 mini","Peque√±os ara√±azos alrededor pero es normal por ser refurbished. La pantalla 10/10"
"iPhone 12 mini","Up until this purchase I was using an Iphone 7 with a screen cracked in every direction. It was a great phone but alas my ears getting cut when on the phone grew old. I'm on a sustainability journey, trying to reduce my e-waste and offset what others are doing, so I opted for a renewed Iphone, and I'm glad I did!This phone came in great condition, all aside from a scratch on the screen. Since I was in it for the better camera, I didn't care about blemish like this. The battery life is amazing, there have been no technical glitches or issues, and I didn't bring a new piece of landfill technology into the world. Highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a cheaper, more sustainable, alternative to brand new $1,000+ iphone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty hesitant to buy this phone especially since it was my first ever time buying a renewed/refurbished item. I got mine from the seller O'Crack and all I can say is WOW.The phone arrived at the earliest date which was really nice.The phone has not a single scratch anywhere and I looked thoroughly. Everything works perfectly and even the box that it came in was a nice box. The accessories it came with were also very nice and not too cheap feeling.In conclusion the phone could easily pass as brand new and I'm definitely buying from this seller in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks unused. Not one scratch on it which surprised me because it came in a USPS box wrapped in minimal bubble wrapped and the box was damaged. Had a charging cube and a cable. Battery life was 100%. I‚Äôm loving the smaller side phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, however much too small - I'm always looking for it so I replaced it with iPhone 13."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks as described. Perfect condition and working order. No problem at all."
"iPhone 12 mini","It was perfect. We all feel a little worry when we buy this type of products not in the official store, but It was all good. Obviously, is not a new phone. In this case it have a little, almost non perceptible, scratch at the back and battery was 91% but it is normal for what i was expecting. The price is so good comparing other sites that sells the same product for much higher prices"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came to me in very good condition. It looks and works as brand new. At first the screen was dim and it didn‚Äôt let me adjust it until I cut the phone off and back on. No issues."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is ok but not great. It was sent without the latest software update and the charge doesn't work. The battery is only charging to 75%."
"iPhone 12 mini","came without scratches, literally a brand new iphone 12 mini.my friends laugh that it's small but i love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","As for the phone itself, I love the 12 mini's size, the screen looks great, it's just so much more pleasant to handle than the other, much taller flagships.But as to the condition... the listing is technically correct. Mine came with a hairline crack on the back glass' bottom right corner, and some scratches on the top right frame, but ""when held at arm's length,"" you can't see those things. Even though it'll always live in a case and I'll never see those flaws, it still might be a deal-breaker.The screen and camera lenses are perfect, not even a scratch on them, so that's a plus.The phone also works flawlessly, all buttons and functions work with no issues.Just be aware that when you buy ""renewed,"" there will most definitely be varying degrees of condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone arrived with the original screen protector still in place, zero scratches, and 100% battery capacity. It looks brand new to me. The phone was unlocked as described. Buy with confidence from this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great product, great service!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm always someone looking for a deal, and this seemed like a great one. Ordering refurbished phones from Amazon has never been an issue, and I desperately needed a new one. When I got the iPhone, it wasn't even that secure in its box. I could hear and feel it move around, which didn't make me feel good knowing what I had spent. The phone is currently in the mail being returned because the battery was either no good or not an Apple battery.I had a flurry of alerts pop up when I turned it on, saying there was a ""foreign part identified"" as the battery part. Within the first day, I was already having issues. The battery wouldn't hold a charge and would restart every few minutes. Even a 2-minute phone call was difficult because the phone kept restarting. I suppose there is an essential lesson in this: it pays to get New sometimes because it will last you in the long run. Now using a new iPhone 13 mini and couldn't be happier!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazon said it was lost in the mail, and then it just showed up at my door 20 days later after I had already bought a different one. It was cheaper than the one I had bought, so I tested it to see if it worked with my Verizon prepaid network, and it did not. I was excited for this phone, but disappointed in wait time, lack of response from seller, and that it wasn‚Äôt compatible. On the bright side, it only had one small dent in left corner of phone, cosmetic issue. I looked at the battery life and it was at 80% of the original battery capacity. It turned on and worked fine. If it had worked on my network, I might have kept it maybe. It‚Äôs only 100ish dollars to get one that has full battery capacity and no cosmetic issues, so I went with my new unlocked iPhone from Apple. Do yourself a favor and just do that."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well but it is very small"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received was immaculate. Slipped my new SIM card in, seamless transfer of apps etc. phone even came with a glass screen protector already installed, and we ALL know installing that screen protector is the worst part of setting up a phone. Very happy."
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived fast, with 99% battery health, not a noticeable scratch anywhere, unless something microscopic that I didn't care to look for. Looks and feels amazing. Got the 128gb for 500 doing18months payment, has 90 day warranty and is new or like new and it actually came with a charger head, what a deal! Just the packaging was wack, sending my secsi phone inside a little ziploc bag with no padding inside a mediocre box. Do not disrespect my iphone like that üò¨ Get you one!"
"iPhone 12 mini","the device showed no signs of wear and the battery health is at 100%. Very pleased with the purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone on my trip to the US, I bought it unlocked to use in Colombia where I live, it came early and in perfect condition, no scratches, the screen works perfectly, it was promised to came with more than 80% of battery health it came with 89%. It looks like new, and for sure I am recommending this option to my friends."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm writting the review on this phone btw, I love it! Had for about 4 months now and I have no problem at all!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived on time. It did not come in the original box but that didn‚Äôt matter to me. The phone looks brand new. The front screen and back of the phone had zero scratches or marks. Both cameras work great with no issues. Battery life is at 100%. Really happy I took the chance on this product!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent"
"iPhone 12 mini","Small footprint"
"iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately the size of this phone is smaller than I would have liked. My fault, so I'll have to make do with it until my wife decides to upgrade."
"iPhone 12 mini","everything worked good excetp the power button was a little hard to press down at first it was like somebody spiled something on the power button but other than that everything was fine"
"iPhone 12 mini","The packaging was ok and it felt like refreshed, like new. The charger is generic and cheap quality. The phone does get hot after charging which may indicate some issues with battery or charging cable itself. Otherwise the setup was straight forward, credit goes to Apple for having the feature to upgrade by NFC/Airplay and synching up all of storage from old phone to new device?"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was sceptical about a refurbished phone, but this one is still holding up and my mom is not a heavy apps user. So far so good, and it's looks brand new"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ten√≠as mis dudas de si comprarlo pero con El Paso del tiempo me a funcionado de maravilla y no me a presentado ninguna falla recomendable no lo pensar√© 2 veces antes de volver a comparar algo as√≠"
"iPhone 12 mini","All is excellent with the phone and service from the seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","bought this phone back in february and has been perfect for me since then"
"iPhone 12 mini","I had a 6 and it was crashing so I purchased this mini 12. I figured it‚Äôll be minor mishaps but it‚Äôs just like my 6 this mini 12 is crashing as well. I want a refund but don‚Äôt want to go without a phone so sucks for me. 1-5 I‚Äôll rate ‚Äúthe look‚Äù a 4 there was a small crack on the phone that has spread. The phone itself glitches. It blacks out then I have to unlock it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone- no defects that I have found."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little hesitant when ordering an iPhone of all things from Amazon. However I was thoroughly impressed when it showed up! Shipping was extra fast and came quicker than expected (within 1-2 days)!Came with everything pictured: Phone, wall plug, charging cable, and a SIM card remover tool. The phone was in excellent condition with no scuffs or scratches. Everything is working properly and the battery health is at 100%.I love how small and compact the 12 mini is compared to the Pro. Fits into pockets perfectly."
"iPhone 12 mini","I have been very impressed with my new phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nothing its amazing"
"iPhone 12 mini","I understand this is a small phone and the battery is smaller hence the battery life is not the same as a big phone. Little disappointing, not the phones fault. The size of the phone is small but it will fit in the console of my car. The first thing I did when I got the phone was to increase the size of the text. The face recognition is great, no problems at all. The value for the money was great! Very easy to transfer all my data from my iPhone 6."
"iPhone 12 mini","it‚Äôs pretty cool, looks like a new. good packing and battery life is %87 !"
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone came earlier than they said which was a plus. It came in good condition and even 100% battery life except that the mic would buzz every time I recorded. I tried resetting the phone and going through the settings but nothing worked. I contacted the seller to get it replace. They communicated really well and sent my a replacement and the problem was fixed."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was surprised when the iPhone arrived much earlier and in much better condition that I expected. It looks like a new phone. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived faster than I expected and in perfect condition. I saw the reviews about the scratches and was a little nervous but the phone arrived fully unlocked, looking and working like brand new. This is only day 1, but I will update if anything changes"
"iPhone 12 mini","Came in earlier and no defects or scratches. Brand new and I‚Äôm very happy easy set up and transfer from my older iPhone. SIM card removal tool was included with charging cord and cube. 12 mini is fast in all apps even in texting and battery life maintains well. Glad I found this seller at a good price, well worth it."
"iPhone 12 mini","El tel√©fono vino con varias rayas, no est√° en perfecto estado como otros tel√©fonos"
"iPhone 12 mini","El estado de la bater√≠a es una decepci√≥n para m√≠, con lo dem√°s apariencia y funcionalidad cumple con lo descrito"
"iPhone 12 mini","Un gran regalo para mi novia, pens√≥ que era nuevo pero la caja gen√©rica lo delat√≥, a√∫n as√≠ es una gran compra si no te interesan los manuales, la caja y el cargador original"
"iPhone 12 mini","I haven‚Äôt expected to get an iPhone in such great shape!!! The battery life is 100% which is awesome and no issues have detected so far. Reach out to the seller who also put the protection screen on my iPhone and gave the charger cable. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase! üëçüèª"
"iPhone 12 mini","I received this phone recently and it was in amazing working order. Looked and felt brand new with 100% battery health! Shout out to eKings (Amazon Seller) for their prompt delivery, processing, and an extremely quality product. Would buy from them again!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Software needed updating, which turned out to be more difficult than needed"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with 100% battery capacity and no smudge or scratches. The packaging was questionable but fine. So far so good I have no complaints."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone for on the go. 5g and has all the options if you don‚Äôt mind missing out on the high tech pro camera. Easy Swap of the sim card and everything worked well."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery life is definitely better than my iPhone 6s, but I still have to use a portable phone charger when I am out all day."
"iPhone 12 mini","Enough said. Watch a pros and cons video for analysis of the phone. From my experience this has been exactly ehat i need. After switching to the 10 from 5s i missed my 5s size dearly. Fast forward 4-5 years and i see this is a thing, i bought it and will never look back."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone worked like a charm with straight talk service. I like that it‚Äôs 128gig of memory and the 5G works in my area. This is the second phone I bought from Amazon and will buy another phone from Amazon when I‚Äôm ready for a new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love the size, battery lasts all day and haven‚Äôt had any problems with it! Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I have bought refurbished phones before and always have been pleased. I am glad I took the slight risk with this one. The only noticeable difference between this and a brand new iPhone is the packaging and the charging cable, which made no difference to me. The phone itself is a huge improvement for me, as I upgraded from an iPhone 5. Battery life is great. I am able to go nearly three days on a single charge. The Apple Car Play is also very nice on this iPhone. The google maps and Spotify interfaces are much better than the Car Play on iPhone 5. And what is there to say about the camera besides unbelievable high quality! Splurge for a gimbal and your video will be Hollywood ready."
"iPhone 12 mini","Funciona perfecto"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love how this is a tiny bit smaller than my old 6, but yet the display is bigger. I like how this fits in a pocket, even in its Otterbox Defender. It came with a handy belt clip. Now I can run all my apps that required 13 IOS or higher, I was out of memory on the 6. Face recognition is nice to help avoid having to put in my password every time."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great Refurbished Phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks good. No scratches or other blemishes.Functions very well. Good touch screen and all apps work fine.Battery life in use is very good. Shows still has 80% of battery capacity (as advertised).Happy with it as a replacement and step up from previous iPhone. Glad I waited a few extra months until the #13 was released and got this at a still lower price. Worth that extra wait."
"iPhone 12 mini","very good."
"iPhone 12 mini","El reconocimiento f√°cil a veces falla, la bater√≠a vino al 94%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing great condition not a scratch on it also came earlier than expected also was unlock I was able to put my own sim worked like a charm thank you so much will order from this seller again even came with a charge such a plus thank you !"
"iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love my new phone, thank you so much! This seems like a brand new phone to me and it arrived way sooner than it said it would. I am very grateful for that. As far as looks, I cannot tell it was used at all. For the price and it being unlocked, this is incredible. I was able to set it up with Straight Talk (Walmart‚Äôs prepaid service) and everything activated and transferred over perfectly. Merry Christmas to Me!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Awesome works great no scratches or dents looks brand new"
"iPhone 12 mini","The Phone has a huge scratch on the top speaker, also, the speaker sounds bad and not bad for the science of the mini, but sound like it was bad repaired. But the cameras and the data works well. Hope this help you and beware of the fact that is ""renewed""."
"iPhone 12 mini","When I got it and turned it on the battery was at 91% and it‚Äôs supposed to be at 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","UPDATE: it‚Äôs May 16th, 2022 and I still have this phone. It works just as it did when I bought it! It‚Äôs in great shape!Hello, my name is Alyssa! I bought this phone about a month and a half ago and absolutely love it! I have no problems with it whatsoever! The battery capacity was 100% efficient, so it charges just as it should. There are no random shut offs or heating up of the phone! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful in person and easy to use! I would definitely recommend this product to you! I‚Äôm 19 and needed something affordable because my old phone (iPhone 7) broke, and, I‚Äôm also paying for college."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is amazing for its price and overall a great phone. The only caveat is that this phone is very susceptible to randomly losing data signal despite my surrounding peers not suffering any similar issue."
"iPhone 12 mini","I bout this phone as a replacement for my son an it hasn‚Äôt let me down yet he has not complained about anything"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with no noticeable damage and 97% battery life. This seller is amazing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","phone looks great, but I was hoping to continue my one handed operation from my SE. but the screen is too big. I also missed the home button. i‚Äôll buybthe SE 3 instead"
"iPhone 12 mini","It arrived on time and everything seemed great, battery health said 100% so i was very happy about that. BUT it doesn‚Äôt even last a day (when in specifics it says up to 15 hours), i charged to 100% this morning (10 am), it‚Äôs 6 pm and it is already at 11% which i don‚Äôt think is good. I‚Äôll keep monitoring but i think that maybe I‚Äôll have to ask for a return‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 12 mini","Received this phone, activated with my carrier, went to make a phone call and could barely hear anything, activated speaker and still could not hear it, volume was turned up all the way too. Returned it"
"iPhone 12 mini","It renewed but felt like brand new, and came with a charger in the box which new iPhone don't have"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought it about a week ago and it just came in today- it was almost as it wasn‚Äôt even used. There wasn‚Äôt any scratches on the screen, camera or the black glass. It came in bubble wrap (not the original iPhone box) and it came with an apple iPhonecharger and a regular non branded power brick. When I powered on the phone and set it up I was surprised to see the maximum battery capacity was 100%! I‚Äôm not sure if I got really lucky or what. Phone isn‚Äôt as small as you think it would be. I would recommend if you are trying to get this phone but want a cheaper price."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical at first with getting it, have been waiting to get my hands on one of these for a strong minute. Once I got it, I loved it! No marks, scratches or anything. Totally worth it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Shipping was a little slow but the phone is like a brand new one, not even a scuff on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I""m so upset I have not even had very long but just long enough to not be able to return it. I""m out the amount I paid for it. I stopped woking properly at the 3 month mark. When I tried to return it, it gave me apple's number for support. I can't get my money back, and I can't return it. I""m stuck with a phone I can't text on, and the screen bounces."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived with a chip in the frame around the screen. The exposed metal is easily visible from arm's length, but a case will cover it. The screen was obviously replaced but has no obvious cracks or scratches.Cosmetics aside, it works fine and I'm going to keep it."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good just has a ton of scratches around the frame and screen. Also the battery is 80% capacity which is weird. When the packaging says 95%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought a renewed Iphone, and I got a almost brand new phone. said battery was over 80% and it was. Said it would come in 2 days and it did. I doubted it at first but it delivered. So very solid product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in really good condition, almost like new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I got the iPhone 12 Mini AND IT WAS TERRIBLE! The package it came in looked like something you‚Äôd buy off some sketchy site. The phone came with no cosmetic damage. But i could even get past the activation screen. I tried everything. Even getting a brand new SIM card for the phone. Nothing. The phone wouldn‚Äôt unlock and i took it to the apple store and my carrier store. Nothing. I‚Äôve spent two days slaving over this phone begging it to work. Nothing. So i will not be purchasing from Amazon Renewed again. Normally I‚Äôm a very relaxed person since i work in customer service, but the fact that this phone is acting like it‚Äôs a locked phone and that it doesn‚Äôt even have the bypass part the apple installs. SUCKS. I just want my refund and nothing else to do with Amazon renewed. They can have this phone back as it doesn‚Äôt even work the way it‚Äôs advertised as."
"iPhone 12 mini","I ordered the item before checking the reviews, then had second taught about this item. However the item was exactly as described and I‚Äôm pleased with my order, customer service is great too. Highly recommend"
"iPhone 12 mini","Loved it. A little smaller than I am used to ( was gifted to me). But, it was wonderful"
"iPhone 12 mini","Lo compr√© re acondicionado y Est√° como nuevo"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in good condition. The Battery life is good, but not as long as I expected. The shipper failed to include a Charger, Cable, and SIM card tool. Phone functions okay. Camera and Face Recognition, work okay, A good value for the money. I might buy another one from them."
"iPhone 12 mini","N/a"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is as good as you‚Äôd expect on the surface literally nothing wrong with it other than the speakers, if anyone calls me I can‚Äôt understand anything they say unless I put it on speaker and ever those are not the best."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is like new, works fine, easy to set up."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came looking brand new and works with no problems. Whereas my previous renewed phone had a problem with the speaker, this one works great and no scratches on the phone. Touch screen works fine too."
"iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini was a very good option. Everything function very well. Any problem at this moment (1 Month)Everything ok with the seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love it, way cheaper then buying new. Screen has 2 micro scratches that you can‚Äôt even see when powered on. Two edges were slightly roughed up but once I put a case on it you can‚Äôt even tell. Would fully recommend to anyone looking for a new phone that won‚Äôt break the bank."
"iPhone 12 mini","everything was near perfect. only thing was a tiny scratch on the back that‚Äôs barely noticeable. The battery was 96% and everything else works perfectly definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a budget iphone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Compre dos celulares de estos uno para mi y otro para mi hija y estamos encantadasLlegaron bien empaquetados no con caja originalSin marcas ni rasgaduras buena est√©tica con muy buena cara de 100%Me gusta son c√≥modos de cargar no grandes para mi perfectos"
"iPhone 12 mini","This is just all around wonderful fun I love the size. Everything functions as it should takes great pictures I just really like it"
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone was supposed to have 80% of new battery life, but it doesn't even hold a charge for one day with normal use."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with only tinyyyy very very shallow scratches on the back that were only visible if you really squinted at them. Additionally, the battery capacity is 100%. The phone works perfectly. The one thing is that the packaging it came in was pretty sketchy. It was shipped in one large box with bubble wrap on top of it. Like the phone, loose with only film on it, was sitting at the bottom of the box with just bubble wrap and those puffy inflated things on top of it. Risky packaging but thankfully the phone didn't seem damaged by transit at all."
"iPhone 12 mini","I received my phone in perfect state, with just some tiny scratches that aren't really recognizable at first glance. It works terrific, the screen is intact, and the battery health state is at 100%. I would definitely recommend it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Absolutely love it the red is not a red like the iPhone 11 it‚Äôs like a iPhone XR coral overall impressed!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came as advertised. It had some minor scratches on right side of screen, but nothing to cry about. The glass screen protector actually hid them. Came with 100% battery capacity, which actually had me surprised! There were no scratches on the sides or back, just some dust. Phone powered right on, and every single feature works. I like the fact that it fits nicely in one hand, and is really fast. The seller responded quickly to my questions, was polite, and the package actually arrived 1 day earlier than I had anticipated! Highly recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I desperately needed a new phone and then I read about Amazon Renewed. I was not sure about buying from them but I saw they had a 90 day return policy so I went ahead with the purchase. I have had the phone now for about 2 weeks and it's working just fine. I could not tell it from new. Best of all it's unlocked, so I am not tied to Verizon anymore should I decide to switch and try another carrier."
"iPhone 12 mini","Best purchase!!! I was skeptical at 1st but hands down so happy I purchased it, I had to default the storage space when I got it, but once that was cleared I had no problems and still no problems‚Ä¶. Unlocked and everything"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is very compact and easy to use"
"iPhone 12 mini","I fit in mint condition. Even came with a screen protector and wall charger.So far so good!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 mini was to replace my iPhone SE. I was expecting scratches and dings but this phone looks and feels brand new. I saved about $200 dollars compared to buying it new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I wanted to keep a smaller sized phone (for my back pocket) and thought this would be a great model. The price for the quality of phone and camera are amazing."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little sketched out by the lack of reviews for the product. I also thought, ""how is it possible to get a refurb of the 12 if it's brand new?"" but it arrived today and I'm super relieved. I read someone else's review that said it was legit and I took a leap of faith. So happy I did! It was delivered a day early and is in pristine condition, haven't seen a single scratch on it. I know it's only day 1 but overall I'm glad I made the purchase and you have no reason to worry. Great price and I was able to finance it with an amazon card to pay it off slowly."
"iPhone 12 mini","Not bad overall, it came in Chinese, but it was easy to change the language back. Overall good value, minimal blemishes on phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien pero quisiera cambiarlo con el m√°s grande se puede???"
"iPhone 12 mini","I very much dislike that the listing said renewed but the phone came in a box that was totally smashed inside of its shipping container, inside the box was the cheapest 3rd party cable I'd ever seen that DID NOT work, the phone was totally covered in sticky nasty filth, the screen had a screen protector on it that was shattered, and the screen has a small chunk of glass missing out of it, and the battery lasts about 6hrs while running nothing other than iOS with absolutely no use, with bluetooth and wifi both turned off. I wish the listing had been honest about what the state of the phone was as I would have likely purchased somewhere else."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is my first iPhone since 2016. This has minimum scratches and works great. This has a very clear screen and very beautiful. Love it and will probably order another for my daughter."
"iPhone 12 mini","Pretty happy for what I received. Came like new and camera is definitely an upgrade from my previous iPhone 7. Plus I love mini series which is why I waited so long for Apple to come out with a phone this size and back to the square body design."
"iPhone 12 mini","A gift for my dota...apparently don't want it...reason...too small...since she has been using standard size..."
"iPhone 12 mini","There are no noticeable scratches and the device came in like new! highly recommend if you want a secondhand device!"

"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered on time and packaged well. It came in ""pristine"" condition with 100% battery health. would buy from this vendor again. I recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It came 3 days earlier than expected which i was happy about. There are some scratches on the screen but I don‚Äôt mind since it is renewed. Other than that everything is good. The battery health is at 100%. I just have to get used to the size since I have been using the xr. üòÇ"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, and came in perfect condition. Highly recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","OK Folks, I really mean what I say: I received an IPhone 12 mini, which was advertised as ‚Äûrenewed‚Äú with little / tiny flaws ‚Ä¶ I did not see one of them. It is literally new , battery health was 100% and everything worked super well. I traded in my IPhone XR and I will update this review when Amazon gives me the money promised. But so far , it‚Äôs an amazing phone for an amazing price (renew-discount + trade in ) . I can highly recommend to buy ‚Äûrenewed‚Äú from this experience"
"iPhone 12 mini","This is the 3rd Amazon renewed iPhone I‚Äôve purchased. iPhone looks brand new. No issues. Great value!Battery health at 85% upon arrival. A bit lower than other renewed iPhones I‚Äôve bought, but still good."
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs small fits in my pocket just what I need."
"iPhone 12 mini","The iphone12 mini received appeared 99% new.My complaint is the speaker quality is poor.The sound is ok, but the quality is not nearly as good as a proper iphone12mini.I would not buy this again. Instead I would just buy a new iPhone12 mini.It's ok & functional...not too bad.Delivery was quick."
"iPhone 12 mini","Only thing is sometimes gets to hot but with continued use"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my new phone. It looks brand new. The battery life is 100% and everything works perfectly. There are no scratches and it's beautiful. I'd recommend buying it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is amazing but came extremely late. Was packed poorly. Came with original lightning cable and sim tool!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Beware. These phones are not new. I knew this before purchasing, but you would have expected the seller to check ALL functions of the phone before placing it on the market. Right? Instead of returning the item, I will have to pay to get it fixed. Maybe a discount is in order here since this item was not üíØ %?"
"iPhone 12 mini","The back camera doesn't work.. it don't hold a charge long enough and it frozen up on me 2 twice"
"iPhone 12 mini","Honestly the reviews have me really nervous however my experience with shipping was great it actually came faster than I thought and but and there are no cracks or scratches in the phone works great"

"iPhone 12 mini","phone will not stay on for more than 15 min at a time. ironically im within days of the warranty. Phone will not connect to LTE or wifi. Phone only acts somewhat properly when plugged into the charger but typically cycles one of two problems i've mentioned. The phone looks brand new otherwise and has not been subject to significant damage."
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought this phone to add someone on my line. Just bought a SIM card and all good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little nervous about buying a renewed phone but reviews for the most part were very positive and the price was reasonable for a new iPhone. So, I went ahead and have been very pleased. There wasn‚Äôt a scratch on it anywhere and the battery charges to 100%. I am not a fan of big phones that I can‚Äôt get in and out of my pockets easily, so the mini is just right for me. It‚Äôs just a tad smaller than my old Samsung Galaxy S6."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone works as advertised. I think it is a good value for the money, but I wish it was $100 cheaper. Fac recognition is working well. It is a little slow sometimes."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was very pleased came with 100% battery life. There were no scratches. Phone was unlocked. I have metro it was very easy to get my line active. Color was as described. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews on products but this one was important I want to let everyone know it‚Äôs legit and you can rest easy."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm so happy I trusted you guys because the phone came in great condition has everything I needed‚Ä¶ nothing wrong with it and unlocked for the price amazing ! Thank you"

"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with a dent on the corner where the camera is. It did not come with original apple charger. The phone was also dirty."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good shipping logistics. The only difficulty I had was finding accessories for the 12 mini. The speakers are good, it charges quickly and haven't had many freeze issues with it. I don't like the swipe features but eventually I'll get used to it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Fast delivery. Well-packaged product. Product in excellent condition. Everything is working fine. Approved!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great refurbished phone. Only a small scratch on the screen barely noticeable. Everything works. Battery was as described around 85% capacity"
"iPhone 12 mini","i liked the fact that it was easy to set up."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was nervous ordering a renewed phone, but it came seemingly brand-new, 100% battery, and not a single scratch on it. Looks and functions great, thanks REXI!It didn't have the original box (which I don't care about anyway), but had the charging cable and the thingy to open the SIM card slot.Packaging was very secure, the phone was in an air-filled plastic sleeve, secured in a box, inside the outer box.Overall, would recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I got a issue with my phone, but the costumer service help me right away! They‚Äôre very fast in communication and the phone was overall good. Thank you"

"iPhone 12 mini","The phone comes with 100% of battery health, just like new one"
"iPhone 12 mini","So far I love this phone. Arrived sooner than expected. The battery life is unbelievable especially compared to my last iPhone. After a couple of days it still has not reached below 50%. The face recognition makes it so much faster to unlock. Feels more secure too. All in all a great phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Reviewing from Australiaüá¶üá∫ here.An absolutely stunning, mighty, and compact iPhone to own! Arrived two days early. Literally brand new as the battery health's at 100% with zero charge cycle. NO cosmetic damage or signs at all, and most importantly it works with the CDMA networks!Highly recommended for anyone outside the States not only as this model is fully unlocked but also that it features a large groove on the right side for the mmWave antenna (For the most optimal coverage of 5G)."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone came in perfect physical condition, not one blemish. Also came a day early, however I did expedite shipping.. The only issue so far is it didn‚Äôt come with a screen protector.. I can‚Äôt remember if this was detailed or not, but I did see several customers say they received one. If I would have known I wasn‚Äôt going to, I would have been better prepared as the phone isn‚Äôt insured.."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm happy with my purchase overall. But was pleasantly surprised when the Face recognition worked in a very low light situation. This is my second IPhone but it‚Äôs been the first in years. Am liking the functionality better than Android."
"iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llega en excelentes condiciones y a√∫n con garant√≠a Apple, vida √∫til de la bater√≠a al 100%, recomendado !!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received works perfectly at 98% battery health. The only real negative is that the back glass had some small scratches. Honestly, unless it‚Äôs prime shipping and free returns, I won‚Äôt buy another used phone on Amazon. It‚Äôs too much of a gamble for something so expensive."
"iPhone 12 mini","Do not buy it lower quality do not come with Apple box"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone so much and it was sch a great price. Honestly, can not tell it was refurbished!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Exelente celular parece nuevo,y muy buena tienda"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great buy works good thank you."
"iPhone 12 mini","First time I had very bad experience with a refurbished phone. Buttons and some functions are not working at all - and I probably didn't discover all of the disfunction yet.The side button doesn't work what makes it impossible to switch the phone of or use Siri. Photos can't be send from the library via WhatsApp and other apps. The battery is only good for one day maximum. And if you consider that the price is nearly as high as a new one that are things that are not very acceptable.Sad for me that I can not send it back as I am now in Costa Rica for work with no possibility to exchange it. Really sucks!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. Minor cosmetic issues but well worth the price and quick delivery"
"iPhone 12 mini","Yego mi pedido en tiempo y forma satisfecho"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived sooner than expected through fedex signature service. It came in a different package and the charger is not the original. But that was specified at the purchase. So far my daughter is enjoying her Christmas gift without complaints."
"iPhone 12 mini","El celular es hermoso, pero se escucha muy bajo"
"iPhone 12 mini","Super fast, great size and fab camera. Facial recognition is so sweet."
"iPhone 12 mini","Really good, looks new and uses like new"

"iPhone 12 mini","I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt get the phone it‚Äôd be scratched, but the phone came brand new. 100% battery life, no scratches no cracks. It shipped within a week as well. Definitely recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","Battery while on low power only lasts until 12:00 noon. Says max battery capacity is 83%Touchscreen is hit or miss depending on battery life. (Have to tap over and over and still doesn't work)Constantly crashing and resetting. I was looking through my photos and it closed itself and went to the home screen.Very disappointed in the quality control."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was a little skeptical about a renewed phone, but it turned out to be amazing I can definitely certify the battery life, face recognition and the value for money."
"iPhone 12 mini","It's an amazing phone. Finally a flagship spec device on a small form factor. I Have been waiting years for this. Minus 1 start for the ""red"" model because it's not actually red. It's more of a corral. Had to return it and get the blue instead"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works good for cheap , it's legit"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo correcto, como nuevo, nivel de bater√≠a 90%"
"iPhone 12 mini","üëç"
"iPhone 12 mini","No complaints. Its nice to have a new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Haven‚Äôt had any problems or malfunctions, other than cord connections. It won‚Äôt accept certain cords, even certified ones. I don‚Äôt like the microphone placement. Idk where it is, but a lot of my videos become muffled."
"iPhone 12 mini","only 87% battery!!!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good but when plugged into a charger it heats up fairly hot. So I‚Äôm assuming this was refurbished display unit. I had to return it due to that reason. Other than that the item looked brand new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product was exactly as described; as new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition"
"iPhone 12 mini","This thing is like brand new battery health is 99% amazing for the price!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition worked great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I've been trying to put a new sim card in my Iphone 12 mini and it's not even unlocked, when I called Apple it says that it is connected to US cellular and I call US cellular and they cant help me they just tell me I have to get the person who's name is on the US cellular account to unlock it. This is BS the phone works great but what good is it if I can't even use it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very pleased with my recent purchase . Phone in great shape and battery health was 100%!"
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratch, 100% battery, not Apple charger but that is to be expected. Would buy renewed again."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very happy, our phone came in perfect condition."
"iPhone 12 mini","Like the face recognition, battery life!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is great for its price. Work perfectly and looks brand new. No scratches. Very pleased."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone met my expectations"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was great until I travelled out of my home city. As soon as I lost cell service my phone would never find a cell tower and showed ""No Service"". Even after turning Airplane mode on and off, and powering the device on and off. I have even tried resetting all network settings to no avail.Once I had my carrier, Verizon, reactivate my 5G enabled SIM card and it came back to life until I lost service again by simply travelling. Not Good Apple!"
"iPhone 12 mini","When the phone got to me and I opened the package, I was happy to see that it didn't have any scratches or scuffs on it - it was like new. The only downside is that the shipping took a while and USPS doesn't offer the best tracking information. All in all, a great transaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","98% Battery Health and no scratches quite worth the $400 price tag"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone came in flawless, 100% battery capacity, and unlocked on the Total Freedom Wireless network. This same network uses other networks that run off of Verizon towers and I‚Äôm sure it would work with T-Mobile and AT&T as well. Phone also still has some Apple Care time left on it which is a huge plus! Would buy this phone again if I needed one!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is the high quality phone that I expected. Performing great!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I mean it's a good at a good price. thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","at the beginning was a little scared because I've bought an iphone 5c renewed few years ago and it came with several dents but this one came in excellent condition really like new and battery 100% health, I'm really happy with this purchase"
"iPhone 12 mini","Can‚Äôt take photos bc I‚Äôm using it, however, I was reading reviews and it scared me to buy it. I trusted my gut and now I love it. It even comes with a SIM card piece so you can open the slot and USB lightning cord.No scratches, nothing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Batter life is limited vs Samsung. I bought it for the small size. FaceTime works well connecting with my patients. Expensive even though I bought refurbished."
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm very happy with this purchase. The phone is great, the battery health is 100%, face recognition works perfectly, no scratches. It's in perfect shape and condition. I would highly recommend it.At first, I was a bit hesitant because it was my first time buying a refurbished item, but it surpassed my expectations. Highly recommended!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect phone, no issues at all! I am on Straighttalk and just transferred my SD card. So happy with this phone and the money saved buying refurbished. Will definitely be buying this way in the future"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value and works as it should!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works fine. But if you buy the unlocked phone, it is NOT compatible with Verizon or straight talk. Don‚Äôt buy the unlocked version because it‚Äôs not really universally compatible. This is verified after speaking with Apple and Verizon while trying to switch carriers."
"iPhone 12 mini","I spent hours at my carrier trying to get this phone to work. As soon as I got it I brought it straight over ..having a business to run it was crucial. The thing could read a SIM card at all! Cartier told me it must have damaged antennasNever agsin!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost mint condition. No visible scratches on screen or back. Maybe minor wear on edges but nothing extreme. Would recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone I have had for 14 days and it is trash the screen is not very real and today the screen has done the photo below no history of dropping the phone or sitting on it we were sitting in the car listening to music and this is what happened"
"iPhone 12 mini","nothing wrong works great, battery 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived very late, maybe FedEx screwed up. Phone quality is good"

"iPhone 12 mini","La verdad muy buena inversi√≥n, el tel√©fono ten√≠a algunos ara√±azos pero nada importante mente grave, a simple vista son invisibles.El tel√©fono me encanto!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was great. No cracks one small scratch that‚Äôs hardly noticeable. The only issue is the sim tray was missing?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Size and useability. Great iPhone features."
"iPhone 12 mini","The perfect, no nonsense phone!"
"iPhone 12 mini","If you're worried this is not a real product or scam, it is not. It came in a plain white box with a random Motorola charging brick and no earbuds. However it had no scratches and was in perfect working conditions. This is a refurbished phone and is presented as such."
"iPhone 12 mini","Pretty significant scratch left on screen. Do not purchase expected unscathed screen. Battery capacity was at 100% which is a bonus."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone is TRASH :( My 13 year old paid $450.00 that he saved up HIMSELF. It doesn't charge fully and says its overheating at normal temperatures. He literally has to put it in the fridge before he tries to charge it. And of course I would have to wrestle it from him in order to send it back because it's not broken like his old phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 mini","Within a week or so of using my phone, it began malfunctioning. It would be unresponsive, freeze, and even called 911 and my emergency contacts without prompting. When this happens I can‚Äôt even turn it off. All this has happened in the condition it arrived to me, as I haven‚Äôt dropped or wet it at all since opening it. Buyer beware. I have bought many refurbished electronics on Amazon with great results but not from this seller. It is eligible for return and I haven‚Äôt attempted to return it because I threw away the packaging and accessories so I cannot speak to their return service."
"iPhone 12 mini","the phone its 100% perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was nothing less than amazing! My husband loves it! No visible cosmetic issues and it works like a charm, you can't tell it from new! Love the back tap screenshot/ gestures! Not to mention it arrived so fast! I was amazed and I have prime, but like it was here so quick!"
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurb iPhone 12 Mini is perfect. Looks brand new, works great.The only zonk I‚Äôd give it is battery life is down very slightly to 90%.Very pleased overall."
"iPhone 12 mini","I had my white one going on 6 months with not a single issue and came with no damages also I have a straight talk sim card so it takes almost cell carrier"
"iPhone 12 mini","This cell phone does not turn off at times. And I am scared to return it because my information and credit cards are stored in it. So I am unable to delete anything. Help"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was clean was lil skeptical but damn I like it a lot . When they mini it‚Äôs really small lol smaller then the iPhone 6 s or similar size but overall great buy an I would recommend. Fully unlock added my SIM card an that was it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Looks brand new and I‚Äôve had no problems with it."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was in very good physical shape. After a couple of days it lost activation with Verizon. Local rep tried other SIM card to no avail. Glad it came with good warranty.I wound up buying a new 12 mini."
"iPhone 12 mini","The best quality phone upgrade"
"iPhone 12 mini","Costed nearly $200 less than a brand new iPhone. Had a few small scratches on the bottom of the screen but disappeared as soon as I put on a screen protector. Besides that looks like new. Battery health was also at 100%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nice screen for mobile gaming"
"iPhone 12 mini","Love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered as promised in a timely manner and came in perfect shape physically. No visible scratches and worked beautifully for about a month. Then, the phone just randomly shut off and wouldn't charge. Nothing would show on the screen either when a charger was plugged in. Just nothing!I took it to a local independent repair shop and was informed that there were TWO shorts on the motherboard of the device. One on a capacitor for the charging portion and one for the touch screen. The repair technician said he's NEVER seen two shorts on a device like this before. This device was in great shape on the outside, but obviously had some issues on the inside. I'm not gonna say ""don't buy from this seller"" , but I will say , be aware that you are buying a refurbished phone and you never know what's going on the inside.Otherwise, this was a learning experience (again) for me and I'd like to share it with others!Thank you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Apple does it again with the IPhone 12 miniCute little phone with lots of powerGreat camera, tooI don‚Äôt foresee myself upgrading anytime soon after this."
"iPhone 12 mini","Do not like this phone at all, it's difficult to turn it on and use all of its functions.It's too small and more sophisticated and complicated that I need.I purchased a newer Iphone and it is easier to use."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very badly miss labeled. It was listed as renewed through Amazon so you think you‚Äôre getting an excellent quality product. However the phone of course is great I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better phone, But again it was listed as renewed so you would think you‚Äôve got a great quality condition phone when I received it there was a deep scratch for the bottom of the display in numerous deep gouges in the top left corner of the display along with several tiny dents in the side bezel. I had to pay an extra $150 on top of this price to get the display replaced. So I only gave it 2 stars because the seller doesn‚Äôt know how to properly list what they have."
"iPhone 12 mini","The charging port doesn't charge phone reliably. One needs to wiggle the charging wires. If you are lucky, you may be able to start charging."
"iPhone 12 mini","To be honest I got this iPhone 12 mini by accident; I meant to get the standard iPhone 12 - but I decided to keep it as it's serving me well"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was excited about my purchase since I'd be receiving a phone in good condition for a great price. I open my package and notice the screen is already cracked! Is this part of the ""renewed"" condition? Sending back immediately"
"iPhone 12 mini","I am very happy with this purchase. I am actually about to order another one. Happy and satisfied with my purchase üòç"
"iPhone 12 mini","A phone for one handed use at last. Battery lasts all day. Light. Fits in any pocket. Super fast. Coming from an iPhone 7, this is a dream. Was a renewed phone but looked and operated brand new."
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone as an unlocked, refurbished phone. The phone settings said no sim restrictions, however it would not work with any sim card i put in it. I thought it was a problem with my service so I changed phone plans, and It still did not work. I ended up having to switch phone plans and getting an entirely new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","The product was in good shape, but did NOT accept my Cricket SIM card. The phone is supposed to be unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","I will say I had no scratches nowhere on this phone not on the screen the camera not even the phone had no scratches perfect condition. Thanks a lot love the phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Love it so far and great price for this phone, what a difference in operation from using my iPhone 8 that I had previously!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I receive the product in an unknown box that look nothing like an iPhone and when i put the phone in charge it overheated and when on video the phone gets hot."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived properly wrapped and looks brand new and battery health at 100%. 10/10"
"iPhone 12 mini","I moved from Android to iPhone mainly because I can't find an Android phone this small or smaller. After using it I switched back. I took 1 star off because I realized I hate iPhones and 1 star off because the screen came with some pretty noticeable scratches on it."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery health for this item was not satisfactory. When it arrived, the battery health was as low as %86."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone arrived in like new condition. No scratches and battery health at 100%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Like the title said... I purchased one in ""Excellent"" condition, but it came with sticky residue, clearly from where an old case had been, and there is a small crack on the top of the camera. The volume up button is sticky, this is not acceptable unless it had been marked down to at last ""Poor Condition"". There was also an app pre-installed about checking the features before selling. This all felt sloppy."
"iPhone 12 mini","Obviously not every phone will be in 100% perfect condition, but this one is fin perfect condition with 100% battery capacity."
"iPhone 12 mini","The Cellphone arrived in perfect condition, all functional, without scratches."
"iPhone 12 mini","Red spot on screen every time I‚Äôm in selfie mode"
"iPhone 12 mini","Obvious that the screen was replaced bubbles and bad touch recognition should of sprung for the new one. You get what you pay for."
"iPhone 12 mini","Slow to respond if it did respond; being the mini the keyboard is smaller"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was looking forward but it arrived with zero charge, took hours and hours to charge, and battery depleted without even using the phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","iphone comes with scratches on the back which I do think it not quite fits into ""looks like new"" in the description. Decluttr (the third party seller) has its own store and the price here is even a little bit higher than the ""pristine"" level in decluttr's store."
"iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately had a time sensitive purchase that I can‚Äôt return in a timely way anymore. The screen is badly scratched up. The housing has chips, but a good case will cover that.The screen in the other hand is driving me crazy. How could they call that ‚Äúlike new‚Äù. They‚Äôre ripping off people and lying."
"iPhone 12 mini","Por favor exijo una explicaci√≥n. El Telefono venia con el boton de encendido completamente pegado o al hacer llamadas se escuchaba muy bajo (hice todo lo que encontr√© en foros y sitios especializados para tratar de subir el volumen de mi parlante y nada). Finalmente lo llev√© a una tienda Apple y me dicen que al ser ""reacondicionado"" al parecer cuando instalaron la pantalla qued√≥ pegamente en el boton de encendido y en la regilla del parlante para escuchar. El arreglo vale m√°s que el tel√©fono. POR FAVOR EXIJO UNA EXPLICACI√ìN PORQUE VENDER UN TELEFONO AS√ç ES UNA ESTAFA DERECHAMENTE!. Quedo atento"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone for my son and we did have some problems with it cyz it wasn't unlocked but were able to talk to them n get it fixed n HE LOVES IT N SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone looked good worked pretty good it's pretty good but had liquid in display when phone was off"
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 Phone was completely unusable. I bought a screen protector and everything. It was slow and restarted almost each time I opened an app. As it kept restarting, the home page began to look more and more ‚Äúerased‚Äù and my apps would just not come back. I don‚Äôt know what the heck was wrong with it, going to return it asap.

Edit: so I took it to AT&T and the phone was BLACKLISTED, so basically this shop SOLD ME A STOLEN PHONE. My whole AT&T account was on lock down, and the phone even corrupted my sim card. I didn‚Äôt know that can happen but if I put the sim in a new phone it would mess it up too."

"iPhone 12 mini","So, there is no longer a home button, and to take a screen shot requires you to set your phone so that a ""double tap"" takes a pic for you. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes it works when you don't want it to. As you'd guess, this results in many erroneous pics being snapped. Also, when scrolling on the bottom part of the screen, I end up with all kinds of strange things happening. That said, the battery life is great, but the new controls are terrible, making the iPhone even less worth the price. Once this one is done, I'll be moving over to Samsung."
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone came within a day, works fine, was flawless in appearance and fully unlocked as advertised. All I had to do was add a SIM."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looked like it was never touched"
"iPhone 12 mini","My item is very nice. Good as new. 100% bat and no scratches. Thankyou seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","Heck yes I came a few days early and I‚Äôve been using it since the minute I got it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Glad I got my iPhone but it took a while before I got it totally working with a new SIM card from AT&T."
"iPhone 12 mini","Stopped working days after warrantee ended-- denied any coverage or replacement."
"iPhone 12 mini","The metal is super scratched on all sides of the phone. I would hardly call this ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. The battery health was also at 83% on arrival. I‚Äôll be sending back for a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","It gets inedibly hot while charging, then the screen will dim to where you can barely even see it I guess to try to reduce overheating

the battery life is also pretty bad"
"iPhone 12 mini","other then that good purchase for price"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was going okay enough until I accidentally splashed water on it. The way this company ‚Äúrefurbishes‚Äù phones ruins the ingress protection so it is WAY more sensitive to water damage then it should be. NOT WORTH 400 dollars. Buy new or from a friend cause this company does nothing to ensure quality AND THEY RUIN THE WATER PROTECTION. A new phone has ip68 meaning it is water proof up to 1.5 meters underwater for 30 minutes. A light dip took this phone out. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very Bad touch screen not working properly even not start."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product was perfect cosmetically, haven‚Äôt had any problems."
"iPhone 12 mini","i like i phone its great"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo excelente me encanta üòª"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone would randomly restart and the touch screen stopped working. This is our 4th or 5th phone that we have purchased refurbished and the first three have worked out but the last two have not. We had to go out and just purchase a brand new iphone at our local phone company store."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good Phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good quality picture. Good prices. Smaller size than iPhone 6s but the screen size is bigger."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great overall product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost all videos that I film on this phone come out distorted and muffled. I regret buying this. My wife‚Äôs iPhone 8 is better"
"iPhone 12 mini","No scratches, 100% battery life, came with charger and block"
"iPhone 12 mini","I had no issues I highly recommend this dude as a safe seller"
"iPhone 12 mini","I received an Unusable phone that did not comply with Amazon's renewed guarantee.... The battery service life on the iphone 12 mini that i purchased was below 72%, despite them being guaranteed to be more than 80% on the listing page when purchasing a phone. The phone dies from 100% to zero over the course of 4-5 hours when left completely alone. It appears to not have been ""renewed"" at all.

I have bought amazon renewed phones for the past 5 years, and have never had anything even remotely disappointing until now.... This phone was scratched and still dirty when I pulled it from its box."
"iPhone 12 mini","Highly recommend. Saved hundreds for a like-new phone. Popped in my SIM card and worked seamlessly."
"iPhone 12 mini","Totally value for the money. Arrived early. Battery life rocks and I love the fave recognition feature. Love this one"
"iPhone 12 mini","Got a blue one, couldn‚Äôt find any scratches or imperfections on the phone. Highly recommend. Great price for unlocked"

"iPhone 12 mini","todo bien"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything was okay and I didn‚Äôt have to wait for a long time"
"iPhone 12 mini","I'm disapointed: Battery health / Maximum capacity at only 90 percent. I expected it to be 100 percent. Also the screen has 2 scratches on the screen; maybe from someones diamond ring?? Should I return this iPhone?"
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone came just as described, shipped quickly, and works great with my mobile service."
"iPhone 12 mini","The product looked fine, just some scratches but something is wrong with the sim card reader, it wouldnt let me use my data, or make phone calls."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical of this because the lack of reviews but I was proven wrong! The phone came fast, in good packaging and works and looks perfect!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone is locked."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Only had one very small blemish. Overall I‚Äôm very happy! Came with 100% battery life and in fantastic condition"
"iPhone 12 mini","80% of battery condition"

"iPhone 12 mini","The picture doesn‚Äôt say many it was too small for her"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent value for what looks line a brand new phone. Came early and very happy about this purchase! Recommend!"
"iPhone 12 mini","We sent in an unlocked phone and it was as described but they stated they rejected it due to ""Carrier information on the device received does not match device selected when creating the trade-in order"". We never selected a carrier which was an option since it was unlocked. Trade in is a total scam to get you to purchase their product."
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this renew iphone for my younger sister. However, the iphone I received is really dirty (see photo). I have no idea why this iphone can even more dirty than my 6 year old back-up phone. I understand it is pre-owned iphone so it might have scratch and dent. However, a dirty iphone?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Extremely happy with what i got would purchase again in the future"
"iPhone 12 mini","the product was as advertised with little to no visble previous use. I would purchase again!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Cumple todas mis necesidades y me ha funcionado perfectamente."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, came in better condition then I expected, looks brand new I was highly impressed! Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Despite paying for the ""Excellent"" option I received what appears to have been marked as a ""Good"" and ""Fully Functional"". However, product had visible damage and the phone speaker was not functional. I was scammed. Just go to the store."
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything is good ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 12 mini","You wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs used. It is like brand new. Great deal."
"iPhone 12 mini","In perfect condition, arrived fast!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Good little phone just wasn't for me"
"iPhone 12 mini","It‚Äôs look like new..worth it ..perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really enjoy my new iPhone. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect."
"iPhone 12 mini","i know it‚Äôs partially my fault that i didn‚Äôt read the sizing but it‚Äôs pretty small. and it would not recognize my face or anything. i returned it and it was basically a waste of money."
"iPhone 12 mini","The touch screen strays almost every time üòÖ"
"iPhone 12 mini","No est√° des blokiado es pura mentira q venden los tel√©fonos desbloqueados no en ga√±en la junte porfavor"

"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect shape, 100% battery life, arrived two days before, minor scratches."
"iPhone 12 mini","Great for the money, I hate payments!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Al dia siguiente que lo recib√≠ dej√≥ de funcionar el microfono, y la pantalla vino rayada.
Me salv√≥ Apple ya que le quedaba algo m√°s de un mes de garant√≠a y me cambiaron gran parte del equipo."
"iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 Mini was advertised as refurbished and fully functional, but it would not recognize my Verizon SIM card. I spent 3 hours between the Apple and Verizon store trouble-shooting, and eventually Apple decided it needed a full back unit replacement. Not sure when/if I will have a functioning phone anytime soon."
"iPhone 12 mini","I received the phone after one week it wouldn‚Äôt connect to Wi-Fi!! Took it in to my carrier, they tried, and wouldn‚Äôt it connect. I talked with Apple, bottom line, it would cost $493 to have Apple fix it. I sent it back."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone started to have issues about 2 weeks after purchasing. Would restart or screen would freeze. Took it to the Apple Genius Bar where the scanned the phone Id code. Came up that the phone had been to the apple store twice before with other owners. Employe stated that it has critical internal problems and it should be returned. I bet they will get the phone back and try to resell it as it has no scratches or damage.. Looks like it just came out of the box. Very deceptive."
"iPhone 12 mini","Battery good no problems here"
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 12 mini","Mad that I paid more for 128GB and it has way less"

"iPhone 12 mini","No scratches and phone is new!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I should have not gotten this refurbished I phone 12 mini . It doesn‚Äôt ring while getting a call most of of the time , half of the time the people on the other end say it‚Äôs real statically to hear me . I could go on and on with all that sucks with this phone . I am not happy at all with it . My old I phone 7 was much better"
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bien asta a hora"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nothing to add"
"iPhone 12 mini","It overheats after 10 minutes use. I use it for business and social media"
"iPhone 12 mini","Beautiful, doubt it was ever used"
"iPhone 12 mini","Brand new"
"iPhone 12 mini","Was perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","Works good but from time to time it freezes the screen. I have to press the power button and unlock the phone, to make it work again."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone was in perfect cosmetic condition! The rear camera was damaged. When trying to use zoom feature, the phone vibrate and screen would show a distortioned output. IMEI number was blocked from visable wireless. They made me pay to return defective phone...
I would not do business with again!"

"iPhone 12 mini","Really enjoying my iPhone 12 mini blue"
"iPhone 12 mini","Everything work fine for the first week and the phone looks new but suddenly it shut off. Now it's in a reboot loop and cannot be reset without taking it to apple. I think somethings wrong with the battery they use. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
"iPhone 12 mini","Returned the phone because it was so small and my eyes are so old! It was easily returned and money refunded quickly."
"iPhone 12 mini","I only got the charger and not the phone, this might of bee a mistake but really wasted my time here. When returning you have to pay a shipping fee"
"iPhone 12 mini","I paid extra to get an iPhone 12 instead of another iPhone 8‚Ä¶only to realize after getting it that it doesn‚Äôt do anything (at least not anything that really matters) that my old phone didn‚Äôt already do. I mean, if face recognition is really that important to you, then go for it. But I wish I could get my money back and the iPhone 8."
"iPhone 12 mini","The charger they gave me did not work. When I did buy my own charger the battery for this iphone did not hold a charge well. I should have bought a new iphone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Wasted a lot of time trying to fix this device because I was not sure if it was something on my end. If your not willing to take the chance of something like this happening, I would not recommend this device."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was so excited about this iphone, but it didn't arrive with the USB cable."
"iPhone 12 mini","I did not like the battery condition. It does not last 30 minutes after full charged"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great, unfortunately you can‚Äôt turn it off‚Ä¶ at all, the sleep wake button is completely pushed in. The phone is unusable, absolutely ridiculous."
"iPhone 12 mini","Perfect"
"iPhone 12 mini","Nice phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","It doesn‚Äôt hold charge anymore just stays at 0% and it was well taken care of with a case and screen protector."
"iPhone 12 mini","beautiful device"
"iPhone 12 mini","Awesome phone!!!!!!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Est√° perfecto!üíï"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone worked for two months and then my service wouldn‚Äôt work anymore, I went to my service provider and they said that the phone was a stolen phone and no longer can be used with any service provider."
"iPhone 12 mini","Because this phone is from Japan. The camera shutter sound can‚Äôt be turned off. Otherwise the phone is good but it would‚Äôve been nice to know before hand."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is bad reseller sending iphones that do not work."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was working good but first of all there were scratches on the back and also the battery percentage decreased from 94% to 92% between a few days."
"iPhone 12 mini","The screen had chipped edges."
"iPhone 12 mini","The Face Recognition Didn't Work and I returned the phone immediately. Would not buy ""refurbished"" or ""renewed"" again."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone came damaged and without a SIM card tray then no SIM card would work with the phone regardless of the claim that it‚Äôs unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","External speaker does not work consistently and sometimes not at all. Microphone does not work majority of times during calls and video calls. Doesn‚Äôt matter of using speaker phone or traditional phone microphone. Haptics do not work either. Did update for iPhone 12 mini that was supposed to help speaker issues and it did not resolve the problem. Trouble shooted with Apple through their app and phone call and still did not have a resolution."
"iPhone 12 mini","Well, this was not ‚Äúlocked to‚Äù Verizon, the SIM was locked period. Verizon couldn‚Äôt reset the phone and now it‚Äôs basically a paper weight. WHAT A WASTE! Definitely returning this nonsense."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was in good condition. However, it was locked to Sprint, and there was an outstanding balance due to Sprint on the phone.

The only good thing I can say is that they did process a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","1. Phone battery had issues, get hot easily
2. SIM card was initially unstable and then cannot be used. Verizon staff just told me it doesn't work even it is unlocked..."
"iPhone 12 mini","Opened up the package and it didn‚Äôt turn on. Even after charging for hours it didn‚Äôt even show low battery on the screen or anything. Just black"
"iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone only lasted 7 months. The phone does stay charged and it keeps freezing. Save your money and buy a new phone!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","When the ICCID doesn‚Äôt appear in your Settings> General> About, it means the phone was previously hacked or jail broken. After spending hours trying to get a signal on the phone, I realized it was missing its SIM/ICCID value in the settings. I‚Äôm very disappointed that this up to snuff refurbished technology doesn‚Äôt go through actual software testing."
"iPhone 12 mini","Producto en muy buen estado"
"iPhone 12 mini","llega maltratados, varios rayones en todas partes, 86 por ciento de bateria, para 430 dolares que te venden el movil no vale la pena. perd√≠"
"iPhone 12 mini","Purchased 2 phones and they looked as good as new and was delivered quickly. However after 3 months and 2 days the back of the 2nd phone started to heat up to alarming levels often and would freeze when it does. Don‚Äôt know if this is a hardware or software issue.....yet, extremely frustrating and disappointing to say the least as the phone is basically unusable"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was a birthday gift for my wife. It was supposed to be unlocked, but it's not. We're trying to get it unlocked but may have to return it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iphone. Two days later without ny reason it just turned off, didn‚Äôt want to charge or turn on again. Now I have to pay more than 50 USD to get a fixed cuz I brought it to Bolivia, I would like to receive a refund immediately!,,!!!!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was locked and would not hold a charge with provided cable or any other cable."
"iPhone 12 mini","This is quite disappointing, as one would think a refurbished phone would include a 100% battery health."
"iPhone 12 mini","Tried to get in touch with someone to explain the phone didn‚Äôt work never got anyone. Do not buy from this here"
"iPhone 12 mini","Not only the battery does not last , the speaker is SO LOW omg, the camera is not even half of what I expected...and the screen is most definitely NOT scratch resistant. So bummed out ... please don‚Äôt save a few bucks and end up with this garbage"
"iPhone 12 mini","It is over heating while on call in few minutes."
"iPhone 12 mini","phone had charging , battery problems and obvious signs of use did not look like new as I expected."
"iPhone 12 mini","A renewed item does not mean to be dirty and poorly cared for. The battery life is at 89% , the front speaker seems to be all muddy, thats still dirty no matter how i tried to clean It up"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty disappointed when I received a phone full of scratches on the screen and on the back."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone was activation locked. I had to get a refund."
"iPhone 12 mini","Called Verizon and brought to Verizon store. Both said phone not compatible. Buyer beware"
"iPhone 12 mini","The speakers are busted. Really bad product"
"iPhone 12 mini","Can‚Äôt believe seller tried to pass this off as like new.. I tried everything including clean re install after that it was worse! Feel bad for next person who buys a blue iPhone 12 mini from this seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Mal producto debido a la poca bateria y mal sonido"
"iPhone 12 mini","To small .. ringer stopped working only had a couple months not worth the money"
"iPhone 12 mini","This was my first attempt to switch from Android to iPhone. The phone shut down 5 times before I even had it set up (it was fully charged). I knew I should have bought new. This mistake is definitely on me."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am returning it. I‚Äôm unable to get cell service for it because the ID is unable to be recognized by the service carrier. Maybe there was an issue with the first owner."
"iPhone 12 mini","It doesn't work"
"iPhone 12 mini","me salio da√±ado el iphone"
"iPhone 12 mini","its okay definitely regret buying it"
"iPhone 12 mini","I will never purchase a cell phone from a carrier again! Product shipped fast, good quality, and easy to set up. More than happy. Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Venia muy golpeado, he comprado antes refurbished antes y ven√≠a en muy buenas condiciones, pero en esta ocasi√≥n es una completa decepci√≥n"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought an iphone 12 mini last week and it did not came un any box, literally was packed in a small bag.
Secondly, screen colors were very warmth. Too yellow to be honest."
"iPhone 12 mini","Es desbloqueado pero no se puede configurar con cualquier compa√±√≠a solo con T mobile que es la peor se√±al y el tel√©fono no tiene devoluci√≥n pr√°cticamente se pierde el dinero"
"iPhone 12 mini","Damage and wrong color I can‚Äôt return it bc I‚Äôll be with out a phone for days"

"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was not unlocked to activate"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone gets hot randomly should have been ck'd out"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone went out after 3 months, would not charge or stay on, waiting on response from seller."
"iPhone 12 mini","Premium does not mean the phone is in perfect shape as I know iPhones will be going down in the next three months I was under the impression that I was getting a brand new phone slightly used they put a screen protector on the screen so you can‚Äôt see the scuffs and scratches be aware of this do not except a premium device when it‚Äôs not premium fair good great whatever because I wanted an iPhone really bad and didn‚Äôt want to pay the price that it‚Äôs at now and don‚Äôt want to wait three months well I will probably be returning his phone or getting a screen protector so I don‚Äôt have to see The scratches on I already had a case for this phone because at one time I had bought an iPhone mini 12 same color as I got now I paid $800 for it and then I returned it realizing that the phone is not worth $800 what happened to people saying no There is once upon a thing called the Boston tea party we all know why that party was it was because the price was too high I don‚Äôt like being duped"
"iPhone 12 mini","I love ky new iPhone I Totally recommend yahh buy one for sure 5 stars"
"iPhone 12 mini","It doesn‚Äôt read my SIM card but it said it s was an unlocked carrier"
"iPhone 12 mini","Had to return as phone was not unlocked."
"iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone back in March and used it up until September 17th when the phone started to malfunction and die rapidly due to the battery not being an apple product. The phone worked perfectly before this and had only a few cosmetic problems besides that it was a great phone. The apple store even with Apple Care+ won't fix the battery they merely gave me the option of attempting to remove the battery and replace it or replace the phone entirely as some other batteries are impossible to replace depending on the type of manufacturing. I recently contacted the seller so we will soon see if there are any further steps I can take to fix my phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","It wasn't the same as it was described. So many scratch on it"
"iPhone 12 mini","Fake phone"

"iPhone 12 mini","Everything worked but the phone call didn‚Äôt work"
"iPhone 12 mini","This model is overall a great phone. Easily pocketable and had zero complaints about it. Battery life is good for phone of its size and features.
Big issue is that after 18 months of owning it the battery stopped charging one day and only turn on for 2 minutes before restarting. The battery unknown and service required message would show up saying my battery part may not be genuine apple part and not recognized. Brought it to apple certified repair shop and they told me that on average they get two 12 minis a month with battery issues and that it was due to the battery on just the mini not being able to handle the rapid charging from usb c cables but has been resolved for the 13 mini. I was out of luck since it was past the limited warranty and did not get device insurance because I‚Äôve never had hardware issues on any of my electronics. The tech recommended I use the USB A cables for slower charging so the battery try can handle it.
Already had to upgrade to the 13pro out of necessity but would have kept 12mini at least until 16 line up."
"iPhone 12 mini","no megusto"
"iPhone 12 mini","Equipo da√±ado muy mala experiencia"
"iPhone 12 mini","Don‚Äôt buy this item!"
"iPhone 12 mini","It said unlocked but it is not unlocked. and the display screen stopped working"
"iPhone 12 mini","They changed the pieces and the battery is not good"
"iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno desbloqueado impecable !!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really had an odd feeling thinking of buying it, but now that I have it I‚Äôm completely astonished! I thought it was gonna have a lot of cracks or even a scratch but nothing. It really seems and looks new. I‚Äôve had it for 2 weeks now Everything runs perfect! I love my Iphone 12 mini 128GB!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Purchased this device renewed from Moot. Phone looked brand new and didn't have a scratch on it. Battery was likely replaced as it's at 100%. I'd highly recommend this phone and store. I use this phone as my secondary device for work and while it isn't my main content consumption device, it's fantastic for what I use it for."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love my phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","The generic charging cable doesn‚Äôt do the job. I had to buy a real one. Phone has been great. A little chip by camera, but not bad."
"iPhone 12 mini","I just ordered this phone in red on Oct.1....I was a bit nervous about if it would be a like the new one I viewed in the Verizon store a few weeks ago. But guess what? I could not tell it from new! I was pleasantly surprised and have been recommending Amazon Renewed to all my friends! It is working fine and is quite a nice upgrade from my Iphone SE (2018) The screen brightness and battery life so far is amazing. Yes, I wasn't able to stretch the payments over 2 years like at the Verizon store, but in the end I am saving money. Also with an unlocked phone, if I ever want to break up with Verizon, I can with no problem! This has so far proven to be a great choice!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone a week ago and it works like new! Came with no scratches or anything which was what I was worried about. It did not come in it‚Äôs original box but that‚Äôs not a big deal for me because I throw them out anyways. Well worth the money!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Very impressed with the iPhone 12 mini I received, works as it should and looks new."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine and does what it should. The camera on the phone is terrible. I am guessing that is what was sacrificed making the small version. Everything is great."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. Usually my apple phones break within a a few months (I have 4 kids they tend to through hammers and break things) this phone doesn't even have a scratch on it. One of my kids threw it across, the room. It went through the washing machine/ dryer, and we left it on my cars roof it fell of and didn't even have a scratch on it. My daughter (7 years old tried smashing with a hammer. I love it"
"iPhone 12 mini","I returnd 3/7/22 but not yet got my refund this to small"
"iPhone 12 mini","OK this isn't really to do with renewed iphone, but my 12 mini had absolutely awful color calibration. Maybe just my unit but who knows. Way too warm. It can be somewhat fixed using ""Color Filters"" under accessibility in the options, but that's not really designed for that and still can't fix it properly.

Other than that the phone is good, I mean it's an iphone you just poke the icons and all that, you know how it works. For a so-called ""mini"" I wish it was a little more mini though."
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone I phone 12 min is locked and it was supposed to be a unlocked phone every thing else is good but I need a unlocked phone or to unlocked this phone or a refund because I can‚Äôt even activate this phone no we‚Äôre"
"iPhone 12 mini","What a disappointment for Apple to release such a garbage phone.
Easily the slowest processor and most unusable phone I‚Äôve ever owned and I‚Äôve owned hundred dollar phones"
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself looked great but when I turned it on it said IOS is unable to determine the device battery health. You couldn't tell if it was charging, It kept saying battery health at 0% and then kept shutting off and turning on. I didn't even bother to set it up. The message I got on my phone said this may be due to having an improperly installed battery or an unknown battery. Very disappointing after spending over $700."
"iPhone 12 mini","This phone has a lot going for it, but sadly also an achilles heel. It has easily the worst battery life that I've ever experienced in a smart phone. It also charges slower than any phone I've ever owned, smartphone or other. It takes a ridiculous amount of time to charge even with a cable, but with MagSafe forget about it. You get a trickle of power that will take hours to fill your phone even in airplane mode. It's a shame because I love this phone but all it does is die."
"iPhone 12 mini","699$ it‚Äôs new in stor"
"iPhone 12 mini","Wont read my SIM card"
"iPhone 12 mini","My phone quit working after having it for two weeks. I was able to get my money. But very disappointed."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was reluctant to switch to an iPhone from android phone, however it is slowing growing on me. Not wild about Apple app availability nor functioning. Still haven't got my old ringtones to transfer and the process to transfer data from Android does not go as smoothly as Apple claimed it would be so it has been a challenge to make the switch.
I find Apple's ringtones and notification tones pretty lame and don't catch my attention like what I was use to hearing so I am still working on that problem.
If you make a switch plan to spend some time to get it working to your specifications. For me, it is still a work in progress."
"iPhone 12 mini","For starters This is my second refurbished phone. I just retired my last one after three years with absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just wanted an up grade.
After doing some research I went with the I-Phone 12 mini. I Bought it here on Amazon.
The phone didn‚Äôt come in the original box which was expected. Not a big deal. The phone condition was 99% flawless. After receiving the phone I looked it over for defects. All I could find was a couple micro scratches on the screen. The micro scratches completely disappeared when I installed the screen protector. The battery life was 100%
This phone is exactly as described. It‚Äôs a great phone at a good discount.
If your like me. You have money but like good deals this is the phone for you.
I highly recommend this seller and would definitely buy from them again."
"iPhone 12 mini","this phone needs some getting used to, as my first smart phone. There are certain navigation paths that are not intuitive for me to get from one screen to the next. Often I just have to turn off the screen using right side button, and then poking screen to turn on to the home view to get to another app. maybe I'm just over looking something.... Excellent condition for an Amazon 'refurb'."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was so excited and nervous to get this phone. One because it‚Äôs refurbished and two because I didn‚Äôt know if there was anything wrong with it.

I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase. The phone came well packaged. It wasn‚Äôt flopping around freely in the box like a refurbished phone I got a year back.

It was basically like new. Came unlocked like I wanted. No major scratches, no dents, nothing. It looks brand new! The battery came at 100% capacity and I was shocked and so pleased to see.

I decided to get this phone because I needed a bigger screen (I upgraded from an iPhone se 2020) the screen isn‚Äôt much bigger so it was easy to adjust to the size.

If you‚Äôre nervous to get this phone, I say give it a shot. You never know if it‚Äôll be good or bad and customer service gets to you quickly!

Edit: I‚Äôve had this phone since may 11th of this year. I received it with 100% battery capacity. Now less than a month later I have 98% battery capacity. I understand this is a used phone and refurbished, but how could I possibly lose 2% battery capacity in less than 1 month? Even as a heavy user that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Like I said I used to have an iPhone se 2020 and the battery capacity didn‚Äôt drop that quickly in the months of me using the phone. So I‚Äôm confused on how this is remotely possible. Especially with the phone being stronger, faster, and much better battery life, along with the A14 Bionic chip. Admittedly, I‚Äôve used a fast charger on this phone a few times, which can be a major role in battery capacity going down time over time, however, I‚Äôve switched from using a fast charger to a normal 5w charger which chargers much slower and is better on slowing battery deterioration. But either way, it shouldn‚Äôt suck up the battery health this quickly."
"iPhone 12 mini","From iX to i12 mini
Reason i did not go for the 13, cannot disable the washed out over saturated skin tone HDR.. Most pics look like they have a sunburn, i don‚Äôt think so Tim..

i12 has a different image processing..
Easily disable not so ‚Äúsmart HDR‚Äù

Well why would i want to do that?
See posted picture quality with HDR off.. Almost as good as the iSight cams in iPhone X..

Everything else is the Same as any other phones from Apple (other than size and shape), it‚Äôs the software and apps they play with and restrict.."
"iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. It is flawless, and came with 128 GB, not the 64 I ordered. Also, came with screen protector. I returned it because it was creating random texts!!! I thought it had been tampered with. As usual, Amazon refunded 1.5 months later, no questions asked. I bought a new SE at the Apple store. SAME PROBLEM! Random texts! Discovered one can change the screen sensitivity under Settings, Accessibility, Touch, Haptic Touch. You make it ""slow"" instead of ""fast."" I am sorry I returned it! A GREAT PHONE. Fabulous camera too."
"iPhone 12 mini","I don‚Äôt have a picture of just the phone but it came packaged well, in perfect condition. Already had glass screen protector on it, no bubbles or scratches. Put my SIM card right in it- no issues with unlocked status. Really a great purchase I‚Äôm very happy with the quality and size. Just about the size as iPhone 6s maybe a rice size smaller. I love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Buying this iPhone Amazon renewed worked out great! I was hesitant at first, but I am glad I did. Phone looks like new, battery health meter shows 100%, and aftermarket charger appears to be high quality. This purchase saved me $200+ compared to buying new and got pretty much the same new phone experience."
"iPhone 12 mini","The battery rated 100%. No scratches or dings. The small size is handy, but I have to wear reading glasses to read the screen. I am happy with my purchase. I got the $15/mo wireless service. I count on wi-fi and won't use the phone much. I have a PC and a large iPad."
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone was for granddaughter for Christmas so no complaints from her"
"iPhone 12 mini","I was amazed at the condition of the iphone 12 mini I purchased. Not a scratch on it and works flawlessly. Battery life is pretty good. Lasts hours longer than my iPhone X. Would definitely purchase again. Much better price than purchasing new. Picture quality is awesome!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Yo this damn phone is the truth! I was skeptical about was I about to loose $400 bucks, but shawty needed a new phone asap!

"iPhone 12 mini","I‚Äôve only had the phone for a couple of days. It was very easy to transfer data from my iPhone 8. No visible flaws on screen. Seems to be working perfectly."
"iPhone 12 mini","I am very pleased with this purchase it has met all expectations. It was really easy to set up from android and because I‚Äôm not a heavy phone user the battery life is not as bad as described. I can get through a work day and then I charge my phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I didnt expect that it would be a great value for a renewed iphone. Just a hairlike scratch at the back & thats it. Everything is perfect. Loved it and glad that i tried to purchase a renewed iphone. Worth it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","The product came as described! No scrathes or phisical damage! Battery came 88%, the phone works great like new. I recommend it when i can i will buy again my upgrade! And the price super good i save at least 350$!"
"iPhone 12 mini","100 percent battery! I‚Äôm very happy about that. There was one small scratch on the phone. Almost like new! It did not come in an original box or with original charger in case you care about that. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and in the box with the extra accessories. It got here within a few days. It was unlocked as said and came with tool to get your old SIM card out and switch it over yourself. I‚Äôm pretty happy. Thanks!"
"iPhone 12 mini","So far I am happy with everything. I bought 124GB storage because I am home bound and need lots of apps to manage my life. Only time will tell if it meets my satisfaction."
"iPhone 12 mini","There are no scratches, and the battery health is at 100%. I've tested the phone for a few days now, and I'm completely satisfied"

"iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, good battery and accessories, and not a blemish on it. For its age, however, I would have liked a better price."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is beautiful. The phone came faster than I thought it would. I have no complaints about the phone itself. My only issue is the charger doesn‚Äôt work. I contacted the seller and I hope they can replace it."
"iPhone 12 mini","I understand these are refurbished but they are not even close to being in new condition.. bunch of dents and scratches!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks practically brand new. No scratches at all and 100% battery health. Completely worth it over buying brand new. Mine came with the much slower usb a charger NOT a usb c as it reads in the description which is another $20+ Hence only 4/5 for the misleading description."
"iPhone 12 mini","Amazing delivery! It came the next day.

"iPhone 12 mini","Good phone, and all I needed."
"iPhone 12 mini","Few years ago, I bought a renew iPhone from Amazon, it only have scratches on the side, and the packages wrap with a box. But this time when I open the package, I really disappointed, the phone only wrap with a thin bubbles with the battery charges together, may be this is the main point the front screen have a deep scratches, if I am not in Hong Kong, I will immediately return and get refund. But seems too long time to send and return again"

"iPhone 12 mini","Looks new 100 battery health"
"iPhone 12 mini","Took a gamble on this iPhone 12 mini as I usually buy new, but I didn‚Äôt want to drop that much $ on a new 256GB version of 2020 device, so I gave Amazon Renewed a chance. The phone arrived in generic box & looks brand new, not a scratch or scuff anywhere. I try to keep my brand new phones looking new with a case & tempered glass screen protector, but this looks as good as my recently purchased 13 mini. For the record, this wasn‚Äôt the cheapest seller option & this was one of those renewed devices that was fulfilled by Amazon instead of the seller - I don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference, but I would buy more devices if they came looking like this 12 mini. I‚Äôm very impressed. Everything works. It‚Äôs not sim locked, like my 13 mini, so I imagine it‚Äôs unlocked as described. Battery capacity health is at 100%"

"iPhone 12 mini","Even though there was a small glitch in the shipping, my phone arrived undamaged and in excellent working order. The condition was even better than I could have hoped for; it has the appearance of a brand-new phone. Their customer service is outstanding; working out the small shipping glitch and making it right with me. It is not often you find a company that is willing to go the extra mile for their customer, but they did and I would definitely use them again in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Acceptable quailty with reasonable price."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone had been delivered with good condition and not including original box, and accessories. The screen has a small scratch but not serious. All function is working good. The price is still high for refurbished iphone 12 in Amazon."
"iPhone 12 mini","Me encant√≥ esta compra, cero problemas con el tel√©fono."

"iPhone 12 mini","What's better than getting brand new looking phone . Paying half price . I wanted a mini so bad well adopt a phone made it affordable to do so.. and it's perfect looks brand new , works like it's brand new. Very impressed I e been telling everyone to order through them. Order with confidence thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone seems to be working ok. There‚Äôs just too many scratches, feels like the first owner never wore a cover in the iPhone. Also, the camera stabiliser has been noisy and apparently won‚Äôt let the camera focus properly. It‚Äôs such a shame cuz I really bought this phone because of the Camera, as I really like the quality in the pictures taken with an iPhone."
"iPhone 12 mini","I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go into the AT&T store again. This is the way to go. They make the iPhone transfer and set up dummy proof. Anyone can do it. And. Ow I have the flexibility to change carriers if I want. Looks exactly like a new phone from the store, you‚Äôd never know it wasn‚Äôt.I personally like the mini size so it can fit. Over in purses and pockets. It‚Äôs about the same size as my old iPhone 6s and plenty big enough to read from the screen."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very nice phone, received in condition as advertised."
"iPhone 12 mini","Almost new I just think the battery is quick to discharge"
"iPhone 12 mini","Screen is a little less touchy than id like but overall great phone great experience."
"iPhone 12 mini","I was worried when I placed the order, after reading some of the reviews. I thought I would most likely just return it when it arrived, but it looks brand new and even better, the maximum capacity of the battery is still 100%. They are 20 cheaper now than when I bought mine, but I am so thankful I purchased when I did and got the perfect one that I did."
"iPhone 12 mini","Very happy with phone. Works perfectly and has no cosmetic flaws. Awesome buy!"
"iPhone 12 mini","I wasn't sure to buy it, but I did it anyways. Just a little scratches on the screen but still looking good. The battery life is 100% so I'm so satisfy with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","Totally satisfied customer. Thank-you!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Couple of marks on outside, battery life at 86% and does pretty fast but good for the price. Face recognition is great and touch screen has good response."
"iPhone 12 mini","My daughter loves this phone!! Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Thank you"
"iPhone 12 mini","Arrived in working condition, only the frame paint and back glass had rub away paint and smudge/scratch's. overall great phone works and does its intended features."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works fine. This refurbish item was in absolutely perfect condition. If I didn‚Äôt know it was a referral but I would‚Äôve thought it was brand new. The battery life is excellent. The gnu system and the gestures for this iPhone are very different from what I had previously been used to, but I‚Äôm getting used to it. The thing I like best about it is the is the battery life. I‚Äôve gotten 11 hours out of this thing!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Firstly, this is the first iPhone I have ever purchased. Before this, I have always only used Samsung phones but I always was curious about the fuss of iPhones. Not only that, but I was desperately wanting a small phone again because a lot of Samsung phones are 6.5 in screens or bigger. That's what made me look into the iPhone 12 mini. I went ahead and bought one on Amazon since the price looked appealing and I should mention that I bought mine from a company called ""REXI"" for $699 with prime. It was on my doorstep in 2 days and when I opened it I was pleased to find the phone in New Condition just like it was specified to be. Even better was when I turned it on & checked the battery life, it turned out to have 100% so I knew I got a quality phone. I took a picture to show the battery life, btw.I‚Äôve only had the phone for a week but I was already compelled to give a review to let others know that if they decide to buy a Amazon renewed iPhone 12 mini then buy one from ‚ÄúREXI‚Äù because they sell quality phones.Also, I‚Äôve heard a lot of people complain about how long the battery lasts and I have to say, with regular use (ie, YouTube videos, internet, talk, text, etc) it lasts me about 12 hrs. I unplug my phone from the charger at 6 am cuz that‚Äôs when I wake up and I use it all day then usually have to charge again by 7 or 8 pm depending on how much I used it. And sometimes I can even get away with making it last a little longer. I think the battery is fine unless you like gaming a lot on your phone then you definitely will kill the battery fast, but for regular use, I think it lasts just fine. I‚Äôm really liking the iPhone 12 mini and after being a Samsung user for so long, I‚Äôve been getting used to how iPhones work differently. It‚Äôs a good phone and I think I‚Äôd definitely like to keep this one."
"iPhone 12 mini","battery came with about 87% so it still lasts most of the day, it was unlocked so i could choose my own carrier, overall a good purchase"
"iPhone 12 mini","I really like the size which fits better in my pocket and hand. I don't like the battery life. I guess because of the small size you need to charge it multiple times."
"iPhone 12 mini","Was concerned buying an expensive, renewed phone online (site unseen), but very happy with the purchase. Looks brand new. No scratches or dings. Nice aftermarket box (not apple box) with charger cable, power adapter, and sim card tool. Unlocked as described. No icloud, find my phone lock. Was especially concerned about the battery health but it's 100%. Shipped via FedEx. FaceID works fine.Set it up and did a migration from my old iphone 7 to this new phone. Inserted my sim card and was good to go.I looked at a lot of phones on ebay but decided to purchase on amazon, mainly because of their return policy. Price was about the same as online auction prices. Worried about getting a phone from ebay and it being icloud locked."
"iPhone 12 mini","The phone seems fine, was in good condition but it was a gift so i have noidea how well it functions."
"iPhone 12 mini","Excelentes condiciones"
"iPhone 12 mini","Just like new I love it"

"iPhone 12 mini","What this is not a new phone you could fool me by missing the original box and the replacement cord work fine. The screen size is the same as my 8plus I am very please with this purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","The father of my child loves it he said it was a great buy the battery life was even good for a renewed phone (89%) face recognition is great and same with the screen he‚Äôs very happy with the purchase he made for this item"

"iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good as new, with 100% battery and like 2 very tiny scratch on the top of the screen, which obviously doesnt bother me (not a single scratch anywhere else). Great purchase and was surprised by the condition, its basically brand new. Also the reason i said to contact the seller, was because I purchased the same item from a different seller and got the korean version (which i returned since the shutter noise was mandatory), so I bought it from a new seller (forefront solution) and asked them if the phone was a US version to avoid another refund fiasco. As such, this time around it was a perfect experience since the phone was indeed a US version. So please check out the different sellers before making a purchase."
"iPhone 12 mini","We have had this phone for several months and it‚Äôs been great! No problems and shipped quick. Love it!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Bought this for our son. His first smart phone. Looks brand new. These don't come in original packaging, but came with a wall adapter, lightning cable and phone. Pleased. Unlocked, pretty easy setup, and easy to add to no-contract cell service provider. Works fine. Recommend."
"iPhone 12 mini","I traded in my 7 and I actually got credit for it. I love the mini. I never liked the bigger phones. They are too heavy and would not fit in my small handbags. The face recognition is super fast and super cool. I have no problems with it. I didn‚Äôt set it up with wearing a mask. I‚Äôm still learning the ins & outs of the phone but it is so much fun."
"iPhone 12 mini","Really good and small for someone who wants a small phone"
"iPhone 12 mini","Great device condition.No scratches as they said.100% battery life.1 Year warranty.61 days of Apple care+ coverage.Would love to trade this and shop for my next phone from this seller in the future."
"iPhone 12 mini","Why is there no Pre-paid postage given for defective iPhone with a large scratch on the glass?"
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien algunos detalles m√≠nimos nada m√°s hubiera deseado que tuviera un poco m√°s de la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a de ah√≠ en fuera bien."
"iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 A black spot on screen that wasn't communicated, but the fact that im still on limited warranty could compensate but if im charged to pay the screen im returning the package."

"iPhone 12 mini","Contras:
El iPhone lleg√≥ con caja gen√©rica y accesorios gen√©ricos (lo cual descrito en la publicaci√≥n).
Una bater√≠a con vida de 81% (como lo descrito en la publicaci√≥n, pero la bater√≠a si se siente vieja)
Detalles de uso en los laterales, es iPhone est√° desgastado y hasta despintado en algunas zonas en especial de los botones por uso; no esperaba un dise√±o impecable pero en el lente de la c√°mara se aprecia como si se hubiera ca√≠do y la parte de la pintura ya est√° maltratada y con rebana del golpe (en el borde del lente).
Lo peor: Al colocar mi SIM no agarr√≥ la red ni de AT&T ni de Telcel , siempre se quedaba en ""red no disponible"" por esta raz√≥n fue por la que opt√© devolverlo.
Adem√°s al momento de insertar mi SIM en la secci√≥n de detalles, no se mostraba mi n√∫mero telef√≥nico sino otro completamente diferente, lo cual me hizo pensar que el anterior due√±o o us√≥ un SIM digital (eSIM) o sigue anclado a ese n√∫mero, este fue otro red flag para devolverlo.
En la caja viene una nota de los pasos para regresarlo, borrar configuraciones y tu cuenta lo cual me hizo pensar que este proveedor tiene muchas devoluciones de producto.

Pros:
La pantalla est√° perfecta, m√≠nimos detalles case imperceptibles.
El tel√©fono en si es muy bueno, es r√°pido (para el a√±o en que estamos 2022) y bonito, pero si se siente algo fr√°gil sobre todo en la parte trasera que es de cristal necesitar√≠a cuidarlo con exceso para conservarlo en buena condici√≥n.

En resumen es un volado comprar reinfurbished te puede tocar uno excelente con 90% o m√°s de bater√≠a o como en mi caso uno con 81% ya dando las √∫ltimas, con detalles que si le a√±aden peros"
"iPhone 12 mini","100% battery life, no scratches, even an apple official power brick! Super happy with my purchase!"
"iPhone 12 mini","After reading some reviews, I was prepared to receive a phone that is potentially not very clean or poorly packaged. But the product I received was so good that I didn't even need to wipe it over the phone. There was only a tiny scratch on the side that was almost undetectable. Battery health is up to 85%. I am very happy to get such a good phone at such a great discount!"
"iPhone 12 mini","Vraiment facile √† configurer et √† effectuer le transfert des donn√©es √† partir de l‚Äôancien cellulaire. Tr√®s convivial. La pile √©tait presque √† sa pleine charge et l‚Äô√©tat de la batterie capacit√© maximale est √† 91%."
"iPhone 12 mini","Still learning. It's different than Android"
"iPhone 12 mini","En est√©tica est√° impecable, no tienen ni un ray√≥n sobre el marco y la pantalla en general est√° bien.
En bater√≠a llego con un 81% pero a√∫n as√≠ aguanta todo el d√≠a la bater√≠a. Venia incluida una mica de cristal ya instalada"
"iPhone 12 mini","funciona como nuevo, solo por unos peque√±os rayones en la pantalla el tel√©fono parece nuevo (es de esperarse por ser un equipo reacondicionado)"
"iPhone 12 mini","Producto en casi perfecto estado, lleg√≥ solo con una libera muy ligera en la parte de los costados, excelente funcionamiento y relaci√≥n calidad precio, recomendado"
"iPhone 12 mini","Ok. So I had my doubts buying a used iPhone 12 Mini (Renewed). But the result was definitely not what I had expected. The unit I ended up receiving was in basically new condition. Did some hardware tests to check everything out and all was good. Battery capacity basically unused at 100%. Overall? Pretty satisfied with this purchase! Great experience! (Although your mileage may vary) Thank you."
"iPhone 12 mini","Llego sin rasgu√±os, Est√©tica de 10, Todo funcionando al 100, Capacidad de la bater√≠a al 89%
Muy satisfecho"
"iPhone 12 mini","No tiene ni un solo detalle y tampoco rayones incluso la bater√≠a est√° al 100% y con garant√≠a de Apple activa"
"iPhone 12 mini","Le produit est arriv√© propre et avec tous les accessoires sp√©cifi√©s. Aucune √©gratignure ou d√©faut visible sur l'appareil.
La batterie √©tait toute neuve avec 100% de ""sant√©""."
"iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien sin detalle alguno, y sin fallas por el momento, la vida de bateria tiene 92%"
"iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto. Lleg√≥ en buen estado. Realmente vale la pena comprar productos renovados"
"iPhone 12 mini","Information says battery life minimum 80% but it won‚Äôt charge full and does not hold charge. A lot of chips on paint. I would expect something better for 3/4 of price of new phone."
"iPhone 12 mini","Product is exactly as advertised, phone looks like new."
"iPhone 12 mini","Advertised as ""Fully Unlocked"" but it is NOT. I am not able to use the phone properly and I cannot find a contact seller option. Took phone to Telus retail store and paid $$ to see if they could fix the problem but they were not able to either."
"iPhone 12 mini","Good value for money."
"iPhone 12 mini","Dej√≥ de encender al segundo d√≠a y lleva dos meses la devoluci√≥n y ni siquiera ha llegado a su destino, siguen sin reembolsarnos y todav√≠a nos cobran los plazos"
"iPhone 12 mini","Je n‚Äôaime pas le produit car le t√©l√©phone n‚Äôest pas fonctionnel."
"iPhone 12 mini","Be careful when you purchase. This is pre-owned and not factory refurbished. Bad customer service. You will need to pay for return."
