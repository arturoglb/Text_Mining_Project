"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Just got the phone. General aesthetics are all well, looks fine. Happy with the purchase for now. Will update review after a few days of use."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I‚Äôm so happy work my new IPHONE. It was shipped right out to me the same day!!!"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Everything works great on it looks new to me. 100% battery health no scratches, working charger"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Estaba tan emocionada de recibir el iPhone y cuando lo abr√≠ la verdad me decepcione un poco por qu√© no ven√≠a en su caja original era s√≥lo blanca y por la cantidad que se paga uno espera que venga con todos los accesorios, tambi√©n mandaron un cargador ese es punto a su favor!
El celular ven√≠a sin rayones la pantalla muy bien me encanto, lo malo en la parte de las c√°maras ven√≠a un poco sucio tra√≠a como polvo lo limpi√© y quedo perfecto!. Pens√© en regresarlo pero la verdad me encanto y el celular funciona muy bien.
Yo creo que comprar el linea lleva sus riesgos de que te lleguen las cosas mal, tal vez sea mejor comprar en la tienda apple. Le di 3 estrellas por que me llego un poco sucio y sin la caja original fuera de eso el cel estaba perfecto!.
A los que venden el producto por favor l√≠mpienlos antes de mandarlos!! Pagamos mucho y esperamos recibir todo bien.
Gracias!üòä"

"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I‚Äôm pretty sure the iPhone I got was unused and labeled ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù because it‚Äôs out of the original box. Idk if this a good thing or bad thing. Obviously the price is higher than it should be but if you just have to get an unlocked iPhone 13 pro max from Amazon then everything was good to go even came with a charger and cable"

"iPhone 13 Pro Max"," so i got the iphone, but how the hell im i going to my sim card if it doesn‚Äôt come with the thing where u put the sim card"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Horrible buy. Stolen iPhone 13 pro max was shipped to me. Had to return it. Still waiting for refund"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I bought the excellent condition phone that guarantees no cosmetic damage but the screen has scratches"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","For the amount of money paid for this item, there was several deep scratches on the screen! üò°"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","the seller described it as an unlocked cell phone, and this is a huge mistake. Cell phone blocked, I'm returning it now."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Bought it thinking it‚Äôs operable but instead it‚Äôs a defective item"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I received this device today. It came in a white box the inside was shaky. When I opened it the device was dead there was a charger I didn't find a sim remover. After I was done charging the device I turned it on and the device was on the home screen. The apps were different from an Apple service. I have returned the device and will update the review based on the outcome of the issue. I also have a video of the device which has the IMEI and personal device info so I won't post it now"

"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Phone screen was damaged ‚Ä¶waste of time ‚Ä¶"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Product came in great condition and worked fine except you cannot connect it to straight talk wireless"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","BRANDNEW ON APPLE.COM I brought one before I knew they were cheaper on Apple I spent 1,547.60 just to receive it and had camera failure front or back camera didn‚Äôt work. Returned it and it was a hassle to get my refund had to do the most. Not even worth 1star."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Nice phone nothing bad came with it but I still love I used to have an iPhone 6 Plus and it doesn‚Äôt work I love my new iPhone now I love 2 of them and I‚Äôm so happy.Thank you Apple!"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Storage its awesome"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","El precio es ridiculamente caro para un dispositivo renovado, no le dan garantia de que la clasificacion IP68 quede presente en el dispositivo y puede que ya no sea totalmente resistente al agua... ademas por unos 100 dolares mas o menos aproximadamente, puede conseguir el iPhone 14 Pro Max nuevo de Apple directamente o una tienda de servicio de celular. NO SIGAN COMPRANDO DE ESTE/A ABUSADOR, ni un iPhone 13 Pro Max cuesta tanto!!! ABRAN LOS OJOS!"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I had the phone it is the worst it is not worth it‚Äôs money. Don‚Äôt buy this phone the camera was horrible and it so glitchy and it turns of randomly sometimes and it take hours for something to dowanload"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Apple hasn‚Äôt made a relevant change to any phone since the 7. Are you really going to spend $1300 for a used phone? Just get an older one, it is the same thing."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","This is least favorite iPhone I‚Äôve had . Actually probably my last one . Had it only about 2 months and camera is junk . Won‚Äôt focus takes awful pictures. Spectrums fix to this is send it to Utah for up to 9 days. It‚Äôs not up to me to do the leg work . They basically said sorry for your luck."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","The best Samsung galaxy"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I traded up my iPhone 12 pro max hoping to get away from the green screen problems, and the massive battery drain that was never addressed with that phone. After upgrading to the iPhone 13 Pro Max I found myself in the same situation but only worse, I didn‚Äôt think that would be possible, now the screen is green and pinkish purple??? This is just another example of a Millie mouse garbage that Apple insist upon shoving down peoples throat, they don‚Äôt care about quality, all they care about is spying on you and selling you polished junk, they lie about basically everything with the capabilities of these devices, this company needs to be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, do you hear that Mr. Cook!!."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Way too expensive to be renewed. Why pay 500 more for a used item and I can get it brand new and save $500. This item needs to be removed."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","You can buy this phone with 1TB memory BRAND NEW from your service provider or Apple for $200 cheaper. Don‚Äôt buy this. Way way overpriced, especially for a used/ renewed phone."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Toooo high prpice if i have this money i can buya new phone at apple why will i want to buy this phone? Thats renewedÔºü"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","You could buy a new one at Apple Store for 1,099.00 and NEW"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","These are renewed items which means they aren‚Äôt even brand new yet cost more than the iPhones that are brand new at apple. Disgusting and fraudulent."
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","El tel√©fono lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones con la bater√≠a al 100% lleg√≥ con un cargador compatible no el original pero de buena calidad una exelente inversi√≥n"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","The phone came locked"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I'm enjoying the device and it's working perfectly well."

"iPhone 13 Pro Max","this phone very nice , look like new , i like it ,thank"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I like the phone"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","I could get an iPhone along with the protection from theft plan for like $1,500 lol üòÇ if we had that kind of money up front, why'd we be looking for refurbished tech?"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","All is as expected"
"iPhone 13 Pro Max","Product AND KEYBOARD are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!

"iPhone 13 Pro","These phones are hard to come by. A few scratches on the edges. Had to check battery before anything else. Only charges at 88 percent but overall it‚Äôs good."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Wow like a brand new phone! Thank you! But‚Ä¶ always do a master reset and go in to Apple ID setting and change name of phone. Mine still had previous owners name."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Love the look but I got a refurbished one and the person who had the phone before me got banned on Snapchat and snap remembers the IP address so it won‚Äôt let me access the app very upset about it"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Perfect condition, no issues and comes with charger"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Very good condition. Battery 100%, just as a new one. Cable was not good."
"iPhone 13 Pro","I just got my phone and is carrier locked the phone is not unlocked, it‚Äôs a Verizon phone and I‚Äôm with AT&T so I cannot use it But like the phone it came in a neat packaging"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I was a little nervous about ordering a refurbished phone, but the one I received was in perfect condition and runs as a new phone. As my last phone was an 8Pro, it takes a little while to get used to the new features. But once you do, it is pleasure to use."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Terrible box. No I earphones."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Happy to say phone got here on time and phone worked perfectly was easy to set up and was infact unlocked so we were able to add it to are network I had no trouble ordering from California thanks !"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Phone performs perfect . Battery life is on par to the spec for this model. No scratches dings smears or stains. Phone arrives on a plain generic box wrapped in foam papers. Well protected. No apple box, owners manual or anything."
"iPhone 13 Pro","It came exactly as advertised, the battery health was at 100 percent and everything came working perfectly, the only thing it didn't come with was the original box. But the company even included the power brick (which apple doesn't even include) as well as the original charging cable. It shipped very fast and I have nothing negative to say about it :)"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excellent description by seller"
"iPhone 13 Pro","perfect phone works great"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Phone (iPhone 13 pro) looked and acted brand new. Not a scratch or blemish anywhere. Battery life was at 100%! Cable and charger were non-brand but absolutely charge the phone just fine. Extremely satisfied."
"iPhone 13 Pro","no scratches no dents! battery life is at 97% capacity. there was some dirt in the microphone and around the camera but was super easy to clean. definitely an excellent purchase."

"iPhone 13 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 No happy"
"iPhone 13 Pro"," No happy"
"iPhone 13 Pro","It worked fine sans a small problem with the screen, but the problem was fixed promptly."
"iPhone 13 Pro","I like so much"
"iPhone 13 Pro","iPhone 13 Pro kept restarting after trying to do the initial set up. Tried backing up on MacBook and was not successful. Took it in to Apple store to see if they could do anything. Guy was honest and told me to just return, there was a history of issues with the phone I had."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Absolutely wonderful"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Beforee ordering I read good reviews. i read one review about the phone being locked. The one i received is locked due to it being on an installment plan with AT&T and it cannot be unlocked. I recommend for the price you just order a new phone."
"iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered a carrier locked phone (tmobile) but the phone didn‚Äôt recognize my SIM or an eSIM. Even went to tmobile store and they said it was because the phone was locked to a different carrier than mine. They said it seemed to be an AT&T phone but couldn‚Äôt verify. Was such a huge headache."
"iPhone 13 Pro","It would not let me select united states when the phone first starts up like it would just be glitch out on United States. Super disappointed. Just going to order straight from apple now on."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Phone doesn‚Äôt come in original box or original accessories better get new one"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The battery isn‚Äôt good"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The price for a ""renewed"" iphone is ridiculous. Why pay more at Amazon, when you can get a brand new phone from Apple, and with manufacture warranty?. It just makes no sense"
"iPhone 13 Pro","In as new condition"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I love this it‚Äôs literally brand new it came in with plastic and no scratches and has the original white paper on the screen like if I night this brand new I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs renewed it‚Äôs literally brand new"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I couldn't have asked for more. The phone came in perfect condition with no physical signs of use/wear. The phone came at 100% battery health. And on top of that, there was the Amazon renewed store policies to act as a net.

Chefs kiss! :)"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered from the seller, HQTRsomething
The phone was in mint condition, 100% battery, and booted up with the initial setup. I put a sim in and works perfectly. Gotcha gods on my side. My only complaint is the shotty packaging since it was just bubble wrapped and the charger and cable were thrown into the USPS box, none of that amazon renewed box with sim card remover you see on youtube. The end justifies the means so I guess so Im not mad."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Por primera vez compro algo usado y no puedo creer que el celular que me llego sea usado, porque para mi esta NUEVO, no pude haber tomado la mejor decisi√≥n. Al principio estaba nerviosa porque le√≠a comentarios de otros clientes que no les hab√≠a llegado el producto o que no estaban contentos con lo que le hab√≠a llegado, pero me arriesgue a comprarlo y de verdad que no tengo ninguna queja alguna. Cabe destacar que compre el celular en la condici√≥n de re-acondicionado excelente. El celular no vino con ning√∫n detalle, ning√∫n rasgu√±o. VINO ENTERO PERFECTO, con bater√≠a del 100%. Tambi√©n en una oportunidad hable directamente con el vendedor y me aclaro ciertas dudas, la persona fue amable y responsable. Muy agradecida"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Came as described. Very good condition, basically like new. Battery health as at 100%"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Apple Iphone13 is the WORST product they ever made.
The texting/writing keyboard is a NIGHTMARE with mistakes. Constantly changes your spelling of words to other words.
BREAKDOWNS CONSTANTLY!!!!! You'll spend more time getting the damn thing repaired.
DO NOT BUY!!!! Probably better off with a 12? Or wait for new 14?"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Really looks brand new, love it"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente compra"
"iPhone 13 Pro","The product is great!"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente vendedor y excelente producto cumpli√≥ con mis expectativas"
"iPhone 13 Pro","If you‚Äôve had an iPhone, you know what you‚Äôre getting. It‚Äôs more of the same in terms of operating the OS, but in the best way possible. Everything works just as expected and is right where you think it‚Äôs gonna be.
As far as my refurb goes, the thing looks in perfect condition. The Apple listed battery health is also at 100% so I‚Äôm quite happy with that. I will say that I had to plug the iPhone into my computer and do a factory reset and update in order to get it to work (the iPhone wouldn‚Äôt get past the ‚Äúselect a language‚Äù screen when I first turned it on). No noticeable scratches or blemishes. I will update if any problems arise but I don‚Äôt expect them to at this point.
Oh! One thing I forgot is they actually gave me the official Apple 30w charging brick and a cable, which I think is better than the new iPhones cause they don‚Äôt even come with a brick anymore. So that‚Äôs some decent savings there!"
"iPhone 13 Pro","I use my phone for about everything and it works great. Love it"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Husband loved his phone."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Recib√≠ todo en orden, funciona bien , recib√≠ la bater√≠a en una condici√≥n de 98%"
"iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente equipo llego bien empacado y al EDOMEX tardo casi 2 semanas, en general esta muy cuidado la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° en 88%
Recomendable y confiable!ü¶æ"
"iPhone 13 Pro","El env√≠o a NL, Mx tard√≥ 1 semana, el tel√©fono esta literal nuevo y tiene garantia hasta el 2024."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Perfecto, literal es un producto nuevo"
"iPhone 13 Pro","La verdad ten√≠a mis dudas al comprar sin ser un producto enviado por Amazon, a pesar de que se venda por la plataforma, en este caso el proveedor fue Big Box Mexico (vendido y enviado por ellos) sin embargo al recibir el equipo wow, sin palabras parece nuevo tal cual.

- No le encontr√© ning√∫n solo rasgu√±o.
- Algunos proveedores lo mandan con mica para tapar rayones, este no tenia mica alguna y a pesar de eso no tra√≠a ni un m√≠nimo ray√≥n.
- Bater√≠a al 100%.
- Con garant√≠a de Apple hasta Marzo del 2023.

Fue sin duda una EXCELENTE compra, recomendado el vendedor al 100% de momento, cualquier situaci√≥n despu√©s si surge algo les mantendr√© actualizados."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Le√≠ comentarios buenos y malos, se que siempre es un riesgo comprar productos Reacondicionados pero decid√≠ arriesgarme y sin duda fue lo mejor, el cel esta nuevo tiene garant√≠a limitada hasta agosto del 2023, 100% de bater√≠a, se conecto a la red sin problemas, llevo us√°ndolo una semana y todo excelente. Est√©ticamente sin un detalle, simplemente como nuevo. Vali√≥ la pena, encantada y feliz. Exente celular de gran calidad."
"iPhone 13 Pro","Bateria del 98% y sin ningun rayon, parece y se siente como nuevo"
"iPhone 13","Phone looks like its brand new.
Works great, wife is thrilled."
"iPhone 13","My daughter lost her iPhone 13 so I bought this unlocked iPhone 13 as a replacement. Phone was in excellent condition and looked new. Works like new. She's very happy with it."
"iPhone 13","My husband surprised me with an upgrade fom 11 to a 13 and I‚Äôm still finding out all the things it‚Äôs capable of doing. I highly recommend this phone."
"iPhone 13","The phone didn‚Äôt come with the SIM card removal tool, but it‚Äôs nothing a paperclip couldn‚Äôt fix."
"iPhone 13","Great condition works perfectly fine battery life 97%"
"iPhone 13","Frankly, I don't care enough to return the phone and I already put a screen protector on, but yeah there is some minor cosmetic damage such as; scratches on the back and the front, as well as some minor damage on the bottom right corner of the edge where it was probably dropped in the past. It doesn't affect the way the phone functions but is really more of a heads-up to whoever is thinking about purchasing from this seller"
"iPhone 13","Un equipo totalmente vers√°til, de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n del vendedor, funciona totalmente de maravilla"
"iPhone 13","Came with a charger, and a back that plugs into the wall. Came with 100% battery life and doesn‚Äôt skip at all, works like a brand new iPhone. I love how it has 128 GB because my old phone only had 64. No scratches, no cracks, and was very well protected in the box. It was easy to transfer my old phone data on to here. I also love the color, (I got pink)"
"iPhone 13","Excellent phone"
"iPhone 13","Me lleg√≥ intacto con bater√≠a al 100%"
"iPhone 13","100% battery life"
"iPhone 13","Fine"
"iPhone 13","I was surprised, I honestly didn‚Äôt expect it to look this new, and the battery life is at 100%. This is definitely worth it!!"
"iPhone 13","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13","Pricey but what a performer. Camera is great. WiFi is stronger than my old iPhone 6s. Love the bigger screen. Battery is forever."
"iPhone 13","You really would‚Äôve thought I received a brand new phone ! The only thing that was different was the off brand charger that came with it. Other than that, no scratches , no mechanical issues, and battery life is at 100%!"
"iPhone 13","It came scratched but it‚Äôs alright"
"iPhone 13","This is my First experience with an iPhone I had a 13 mini and I just couldn‚Äôt handle the smallness of it so I sent it back and got the 13 and I really like the size of it it fits my hand good.. really in love with this phone! Technology can s amazing!"
"iPhone 13","Lots to learn with a new phone but I love it"
"iPhone 13","one of the most expensive and best products i‚Äôve bought on amazon! this phone is basically brand new! the battery capacity is 100% and i have yet to discover any problems with this phone! worth the price, 10/10"
"iPhone 13","Me gusto lleno todas mis expectativas recomendado 100%"
"iPhone 13","Too many noticeable scratches and paint chips to consider the phone in ‚Äúexcellent condition‚Äù. Upon trying to charge the phone, it had difficulties detecting the charger. Not sure if this was due to the phone or the other person on the line, but when calling someone they couldn‚Äôt hear me clearly either. Did not come in the original iPhone box and did not come with any original iPhone power adapter or cables. For the amount paid and the condition stated, I expected better. Not terrible, just not great."
"iPhone 13","Easy to set up"
"iPhone 13","Bought it because I cracked my Samsung s21 I‚Äôve used apple products before but this exceeded my expectations. The back is slippery so might want to slap a case on it and battery life (depending on usage) can easily last me a full day might need to turn on power saved mode and decrease screen brightness near the end of the day but you won‚Äôt need to worry about it dying on you real quickly"
"iPhone 13","These phones are like brand new... Glad I made the purchase..."
"iPhone 13","Excelente tengo una semana de haberlo recibido y me lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones un par de rayones milim√©tricos pero muy muy dif√≠cil de detectar a simple vista.Lo √∫nico que criticar√≠a son los controles de calidad, debido que en la galer√≠a ven√≠an fotos del due√±o anterior, las borr√© y ya!"
"iPhone 13","I upgraded from an iPhone 5 and wow what a difference. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the money for a new phone so I went with this one, it didn‚Äôt have an Apple box but I don‚Äôt care about that. I received a phone that was in pristine shape no scratches, nics, or dents. It looked brand new and in fact still has Apples warranty until March. I did go ahead and get the insurance for the phone along with a screen saver and case all in all I would defiantly buy from here again."
"iPhone 13","I like the product, and am satisfied."
"iPhone 13","The media could not be loaded.
 En general todo esta perfecto, la duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a es excelente me dura hasta m√°s de 24 horas, lo uso todo el d√≠a. La c√°mara es justo lo que quer√≠a. Cumple totalmente."

"iPhone 13","No need to buy new when you are able to get products in this condition."
"iPhone 13","This phone came in much better shape then described! Absolutely so scratches whatsoever and it looks as if it is a brand new phone!! It even came with 3 months free Apple TV for ‚Äúpurchasing a new iPhone‚Äù! It really is like the phone was never used. Even came with a screen protector already installed onto the phone. Great product and great seller."
"iPhone 13","The phone is in great condition and it works very well. Would recommend."
"iPhone 13","I had the IPhone 11 for two years and it was starting to die on me battery wise. So I took a leap of faith and got the 13 on Amazon for about a hundred dollars cheaper than buying it in store. It came perfect. Charger and all, no scratches or anything. I have had no issues in the 6 months I‚Äôve had it."

"iPhone 13","I wanted to wait for a bit before putting my review and I am honestly impressed. This was my first iphone and I don't regret this buy. The phone came and was really nice had a couple scuffs but nothing a quick wipe with a cloth couldn't handle. It works really well and had 100 percent battery compasity. Overall this is something I would recommend."
"iPhone 13","Everything came out perfectly just one little scratch on the right top corner but it‚Äôs barely visible overall the phone works and battery/camera is definitely worth the upgrade coming from an iPhone 8 plus.

I didn‚Äôt like how it did not have a iPhone box."

"iPhone 13","iPhone 13 (unlocked) came in pretty quickly - can't say shipping speed was an issue. However, what I can say is an issue follows.

On taking the phone out of the box and starting it up, everything went well. Past this point, and well, it went downhill. I took my sim and placed it in the phone prior to setting it up and was met with constant ""searching for signal"". I tried multiple times to reset the phone, take out sim, even tried an esim with my carrier to no avail. After realizing my carrier was unable to assist me (and there was no support option with the seller listed), I went directly to Apple. Apple informed me the phone I had purchased had a failing cellular base band. The product details state the following ""This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple."". I understand it may not be certified by Apple, however, if this product was ""professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors"", why then did I receive a product which does not work. If Apple support identifies any other issues, I will be returning the phone and I will be expecting a full refund as the product sold does not satisfy their following statement ""The product is refurbished, fully functional, and in excellent condition. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.""

Also, as an FYI, the unlocked phone I purchased was initially set up for a carrier and was later unlocked to allow all carriers.

Buyers beware.

*will update review based on Apple's response to my warranty repair request*

UPDATE - Apple completed a warranty repair on the phone and it is working as intended. The phone did come with a limited warranty which covered the repair."

She told me her new phone (iphone 13) is working way better."
"iPhone 13","They gave me a broken phone then did not refund me all of my money because it was broken. Please just go to the apple store and buy one it is only $10 more. These people sell refurbished phones without completely verifying the parts to make sure that it‚Äôs useable.

2 weeks after having this phone it shut down on me. I immediately requested for a refund but was instead given a message saying ‚Äútry resetting the phone‚Äù. I took it to the apple store, had it reset and restored multiple times but the phone would still continue to shut off completely at random. It got to the point where it stayed off and would not turn back on. Apple estimated $356 for repairs and saw that the phone already had a history of being taken into the Apple store for the SAME PROBLEM. Other customers of Maverick Wireless had purchased this phone and had to return it for the same reasons, yet they continue to distribute this phone to customers and not providing a full refund.

Not only did I waste hours of my time trying to fix a phone that this company will simply resell as is again, but I lost $400 due to ‚Äúdamages‚Äù I did not cause.

I UNDERSTAND IT‚ÄôS CONVENIENT BUT THE RISK IS NOT WORTH IT :(
I never write reviews especially bad ones but as a young adult in college, wasted money is just heartbreaking."

"iPhone 13","Pretty color and true to description"
"iPhone 13","I have used android, iPhone, and crypto phones for the last several years, I would like to say that iPhones and in particular the iPhone 13 are radically behind in every category.

usability on this phone is dreadful, it's not easy to use with one or two hands, the Apple keyboard is ridiculously stupid when compared to an android. It's clumsy, it's too small, the auto correct feature Apple has doesn't work.

on a Google device if you slide, THE, Google learns that you mean THE, and you teach it how you type or how you speak. Apple devices it seems like the purposefully correct too a sixth grade level.

On an android I didn't have to worry about speech rate, or enunciating, because it learned. iPhones and Apple products don't, they stay stupid. There is no adaptation making communication very slow, cumbersome, like you're dealing with a child.

The OS, on an iPhone it's an open book. Are used two FA, crypto keys, pins and passwords and an iPhone and Apple product is very literally a hackers wet dream. You can't keep them out, and have to find third-party security in order to be minimally safe in this world.

Service and reliability, iPhone has to connect to Wi-Fi for everything, the OS is so slow operating only on cellular data. Any other phone on the market Wi-Fi is a secondary option, for iPhone it's mandatory for basic features.

Even with a Wi-Fi connection the OS on an iPhone is comparable to running DOS 3.0, it's slower than dirt, a snail going uphill in a heat storm is faster. YouTube barely loads, tick-tock barely operates, lag is ridiculous and incredible.

now when brought to Apple engineers, they said this was normal. That my phones, I tried multiple, that's just how Apple's operate.

In summary iPhones are the cheapest and least reliable, pieces of equipment on the market but are the most expensive out there. My advice is to buy anything else if you have to do anything on the Internet at all."
"iPhone 13","The design looks nice but the function design is stupid/terrible, they placed the 5g antenna location in one of the worst possible places to put it, on the right side of the phone below the power button where your hand grips the phone, what were they thinking! 5G is easily blocked and they placed it in a place where it will have extra barriers to go through and also not to mention all the radiation that is being sent through your hands. A much better place would have been on the top edge of the phone or on the back of the phone or on the bottom edge. But of all the places they put it they placed it in one of the worst possible places if not the worst location. And this is true of the 12 series the 13 series and I believe the 11 series (not sure on 11 as I haven't really seen it)"
"iPhone 13","It‚Äôs literally more expensive than a new one from apple"
"iPhone 13","I am fairly new to iOS...I've been an android user since the very beginning and truth be told, I prefer a lot of that ecosystem to apple's...however, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Cupertino brings to the table and how well they've done it.

Through work I have acquired an iPhone 12 and recently they replaced it with a 13. The phone is virtually identical on the outside...so much that the case I was using on my 12 fit the 13 perfectly. On the outside there are only 2 differences that are fairly easy to spot. First is the smaller notch and on back it's the camera placement. Otherwise, they look the same. This is the pattern that apple has used for a long time and why go and change things now, right? What they changed was almost entirely internal, and you CAN tell a difference.

My 12 booted up from being shut off faster than any android I have ever owned by a pretty significant margin. The 13 is even faster. Not sure how they pulled that off since the 12 was already crazy quick to boot-up, but they did. To give you an idea, I can try to start my iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 Ultra at the same time and not only will the 12 boot up faster, but after it has booted up, I can also start up my 13 and it too will finish just barely ahead of what it took the S21 to pull off. I find that astonishing. Don't get me wrong, I still love my Galaxy, but wow, that is impressive.

I signed up for iOS Beta and downloaded iOS 16. What a wonderful update. The lock screen alone is worth updating your phone. That isn't all, but certainly a nice upgrade. They still can't truly do ""live"" wallpaper (c'mon apple, when are going to finally give in and allow it???) but they come a lot closer than they have previously.

Some of the photo advancements are absolutely phenomenal. Being able to long press on a photo and pull images right out of the background is truly wicked cool and a feature I guarantee a lot of people will get a kick out of. I have used it a LOT since finding it. Seriously, it could be my favorite new tool from iOS 16.

Being able to see a WiFi password on your phone in order to share it with others may seem like a simple thing but it is absolutely a genius idea and something we all should have had access to from the very beginning. Trust me, at some point it'll come in handy you watch.

There are honestly too many cool new tweaks to mention here. Many of them will also be available to older iPhone models when you get iOS 16, but I truly enjoy the implementation on the 13. If truth be told I would have preferred an iPhone 13 Pro Max (I prefer bigger phones in general) but when you get a phone for free thru work, I guess I can't complain now can i?

One additional thing I have noticed with the 13 is absolutely incredibly battery life. It's a smaller battery than my S21 Ultra (by a lot, 5,000 mAh vs 3,227 mAh) and yet the iPhone will run circles around my Samsung battery-wise. Seriously, it isn't even remotely close. OS optimization still ranks as one of the things apple continues to do better than pretty much everyone else and clearly that is still the case and they only increase that gap here. Kudos to apple for this truly amazing improvement.

The truth of the matter is this: android and iOS are blurring the lines between what each can do with each new update...but that's a good thing. Do I prefer my 13 to my S21? Well that is a difficult thing to answer. In some ways I clearly appreciate iOS more...in other ways, Samsungs iteration of Android is the clear winner. As I said, as they blur the lines those differences become harder to define and the truth is, it comes down to which OS do you prefer using overall? For me, I like them both. Some parts more than others, but iOS 16 makes it harder than ever before for me to hate on apple. I really LOVE my iPhone 13...and from a die-hard android fan, that is definitely saying something.

***UPDATE***

I have noticed something I forgot to mention earlier. The 5G service on the 13 is significantly improved over what I was getting with the 12. Not sure why it seems so much better, but it is a noticeable improvement and found it worthy of mentioning.

I signed up for the iOS Beta program and upgraded to iOS 16 and after installing the second Beta update, I have experienced a few bugs that have been annoying and I'm sure will be fixed in an upcoming update. My messages app is all out of whack. Hard to describe, but you start a chat and it doesn't show what you're typing, you have to minimize the keyboard first. Not always, but it's enough and appears unexpectedly that it is a royal pain when it happens.

I am also having difficulty with sending text messages. I can receive them, but I can't seem to send them. I have re-started my phone multiple times to see if it may reset by doing so, but so far, no luck. I had zero issues with the first iOS Beta 16 update...not so much with the second. Just an FYI.

***UPDATE #2***

I am almost at the point where I genuinely prefer my iPhone to my Galaxy S21 Ultra. ALMOST. I still prefer a bigger screen (the Pro Max would solve this, obviously) and as long as I can use an S-Pen that will almost always make me prefer it over anything apple produces.

However...I signed up to be a Beta tester and downloaded iOS 16 and wow...game changing update. The lock screen alone makes it drastically improved. The ability to long-press on an image within a photo and save it almost like a photoshop cut-out is absolutely and unabashedly a fantastic tool that amazes literally everyone who has seen it (including me). My Galaxy though has image erase which to me is even more useful and works surprisingly well...and I use it almost daily. Obviously apple could do this, but I truly believe that apple would rather not add a feature after an android model has had it for fear of looking like they are copying. Oh eventually they give in, but it usually takes several years. As an example, wireless charging took FOREVER to come to apple. I had it with my Nexus 4 almost 10 YEARS ago. Steve Jobs said 3.5 inch screen was the perfect size and as long as he was in charge, the iPhone wouldn't expand...and it never did - til he passed away. The very first iPhone with a bigger screen didn't happen til 2014 with the iPhone 6 Plus and instantly became their biggest selling device to date. All I'm saying is apple could (and should) copy this feature for their phones. Knowing Cupertino, they could not only include it, but improve it considerably. Samsung had it with the introduction of the S21 and the Pixel 6 introduced it too...but for some reason it seems that the fact Samsung had it before them went unnoticed. Go figure. I don't care WHO had it first, I just care that genuinely useful tech be adopted properly and in ways that helps it WORK - which is what apple does better than almost anyone. Face it, no matter what tech is adopted by android ahead of apple, you can bet when the iPhone eventually gets around to introducing it, their version of it will be smoother and probably more reliable. Not always, but in most cases? Yes.

I still wish apple would adopt TRUE live wallpaper that animates whenever your screen is on because what they have that they consider to be live wallpaper just plain ISN'T no matter what apple or anyone else says. iOS 16 does improve upon that with the astronomy wallpaper, but it isn't quite the same. Not sure why apple won't pull the plug on it, either. They do with certain watch faces which are crazy popular, but not their phones. I find that just weird.

All in all I am slowly but surely becoming a giant fan of iOS. The differences between android and apple are becoming more and more blurred with each new update and iteration of each's operating system and I think that's a good thing. Each offers plenty that you cannot get with the other and just the way things operate differentiate what you end up going with and that's okay. I just wish apple products didn't cost 30-75% more than many android equivalents. But hey, this IS a capitalist society and if you can get that price, why not charge it?"
"iPhone 13","Thank you Apple for the 2' cord and no charge plug. $1000 well spent."
"iPhone 13","First I‚Äôll say that I like the MagSafe chargers that are also available on the 12, besides that this phone is worse than the XS. The camera is not good at taking close ups, the battery lasts a day if I have it on low power mode and close apps I‚Äôm not using. 5G is obviously not ready for the public and I‚Äôve never had to restart my phones this often either."
"iPhone 13","The reason you see so many negative reviews is Apple is very difficult to work with when you have a problem with a feature. You can get their hardware fixed, but if you have an issue with anything else it is absolutely terrible to work with Apple. You have to go through all kinds of authentication. Once you give them the info, they will not provide a support ticket. Instead you will get an auto response from a no reply e-mail address. Apple support is a huge black hole."
"iPhone 13","I needed a new phone for a long time. I so pleased with this purchase. It takes good pictures stays charged forever and the face recognition is great."

Has problems working at times and like hard time when I am on call to hear me when I Face-Time. Also, it‚Äôs not that bad but, recommend Android Phone instead of an iPhone because it has some better quality. I think the iPhone 13 is a good choice to have as a phone. The good qualities that go good with the phone is that it is good for taking a picture of things. I love to use the phone because you can play games that you want and be talking, texting also doing other things on your phone as to having any other phone. Some of the other phones are different but, I think this would be the best choice for you to have. The phone is the best thing to order things also it is fun to be watching videos and other things. You will love it but, also have some bad things about it that you won‚Äôt like about it."

I've had it for two months now, didn't come with any scratches, hasn't had any weird glitch, and has responded great to all the stuff i download it there ! (getting a 128gb iPhone for less than $900 sounds like a fair deal knowing how over priced iphones are lol). The only thing is that the charger wasn't the original one but hey at least it brought a charger and a phone in perfect condition! It is also unlocked and i will finish it paying in December (I got it with klarna), which I feel it's fair compared to the iPhone 11 i got from at&t in 2019 and finished paying in December 2021 with the monthly payments being $150 lol."

"iPhone 13 mini","Used/refurbished iPhone 13 mini with very few scratches, only on the back. I'm satisfied."
"iPhone 13 mini","I was a bit weary buying a phone from a seller I haven‚Äôt bought from before, that‚Äôs a lot of trust when spending $600. I‚Äôve waited a few weeks to write this review to make sure all was well. The phone came in great condition with no scratches, nicks or dents. Battery condition said it was still at 100% so that was really nice. All and all very satisfied with the seller.

Now to the review of the phone itself.
This is a fantastic phone in every way. I‚Äôve bought budget phones for 10 years now because I couldn‚Äôt afford the best money could buy. The last iPhone I had was the iPhone 5. This happened to be within my budget and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the phone itself. I was coming from a pixel 4a so a slight downsize from a 5.7 in screen to a 5.4 wasn‚Äôt an issue at all. I truly enjoy a smaller phone as I have small hands and find large heavy phones annoying. To have basically a flagship phone but in smaller packaging has been great. Battery life is actually a lot better than expected and Lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. If your hesitant to get this phone, don‚Äôt be! I will update the review if anything changes but so far I‚Äôm absolutely in love with my new phone."
"iPhone 13 mini","Shipping was very fast I received the product much sooner than anticipated which was a good thing. However I think I would‚Äôve been better off buying a new iPhone mini 13 this one didn‚Äôt even come with the original packaging it was just bubble wrapped with a charger and cable thrown in for looks. The charging block and cable quickly failed after only a couple of uses and I had to go buy a new charging cable and a new charging block the phone is charging fine now. I actually had to reset the phone to factory settings before I used it?!? I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on something that‚Äôs either new or renewed I wouldn‚Äôt buy a $650 iPhone from this vendor again."
"iPhone 13 mini","La bater√≠a no est√° bueno"
"iPhone 13 mini","No vino cargador como dec√≠a que ven√≠a, lo dem√°s todo bien"
"iPhone 13 mini","Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it didn‚Äôt come with the actual iPhone box it just came in a zip lock bag and did not come with the proper charger it states it would come with and for almost paying retail price I would of really liked to have the box and the actual charger it supposed to come with which is the usb c to lighting cable but yeah apple is skimming us by not giving us headphones or a charging brick now days they say it‚Äôs for the environment but that‚Äôs bs only saves them money while the consumer pays extra will update my review if I have to as I continue using the phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","Just know if you buy plug for the wall that this phone comes with the old style cord not the new"
"iPhone 13 mini","Thanks Loreta"
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone In Acceptable condition and hoped for the best and i could not be more satisfied. The phone came with zero scratches, dents or cracks and on top of that i got a free screen protector. Apart from the unoriginal apple box and the minor fact that someone else owned this device, i dont see why anyone would buy a brand new phone for 200 dollars more. The only downside to this purchase was the fact they gave me an iphone 12 mini screen protector instead of the 13 mini one but who cares. Totally Worth My Money!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Unlocked phone works good came with a screen protector."
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone arrived on time and was like a new one. No scratches, no problems. I took the sim from my old phone and put it in the new one and followed along with what popped up. It worked perfectly. So I purchased another one for me. This one was for my wife"
"iPhone 13 mini","Can‚Äôt really rate much yet, as we just received this product a week ago. But of all the refurbished phones we‚Äôve bought through Amazon this is the only that‚Äôs ever come with scratches on the screen. A little disappointed in that."
"iPhone 13 mini","Very surprised of the condition of the phone, battery life was at 100%, no scratches or smudges."
"iPhone 13 mini","Upgraded from iPod touch - which I still have and use. Got this renewed item due to new not being available. Prefer smaller size that mini fulfills. Actually bigger than expected. Just right."
"iPhone 13 mini","It was everything I was hoping for and more, everything is working like I‚Äôd hoped and the battery is at 100% health. My only issue is with a small delay on the buttons but it‚Äôs barely noticeable unless I‚Äôm really focusing on it. 10/10 must buy"
"iPhone 13 mini","I‚Äôve always purchased my phones new so I was a little leary about ordering a preowned phone, but I am so happy I did! I ordered through the seller HQTRONIC LLC on 3/21 and received it on 3/24 which was way earlier than the expected delivery date of 3/29-4/4. Upon opening the shipping box, the phone was wrapped in a foam sleeve and there was a new charging cord and plug included. There was not a single scratch or any knicks on the phone‚Ä¶it looks new! I was a little concerned as the battery was at 2%, but I charged it up and battery health shows 100%! I upgraded to this from a 5 year old iPhone 7 which was having issues with the battery and I had to keep it on a charging cord most of the day and I‚Äôm so happy that I decided to upgrade. I‚Äôm a very happy customer and the savings on this certified renewed iPhone will practically pay for a full year of my Mint Mobile service! Thank you HQTRONIC LLC and Amazon!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Works great! Good solid phone with excellent battery life does what it should no problems. The mini size is nice because I can easily control what I‚Äôm doing with one hand and it fits in my pocket very nicely. Don‚Äôt care for the pink just got a good deal on it and with my Otter Box you can‚Äôt tell."
"iPhone 13 mini","I was hesitant on purchasing a refurbished phone as it was my first time. I am pleasantly surprised on what a great deal it was I love my new phone thanks !"
"iPhone 13 mini","package does not come with official apple charger or sim card opener !!
phone is real tho, i just think they should‚Äôve made them bigger"
"iPhone 13 mini","Me lleg√≥ en condiciones excelentes, pr√°cticamente nuevo"
"iPhone 13 mini","Almost perfect! The body of the phone is in really good condition I don‚Äôt see any scratches or scrapes or dents or cracks the only issue with the body I see is there‚Äôs some discoloration in the top right corner it looks like the blue was worn off a little bit and is now silver in that one spot I‚Äôve added a photo in the spot everything else with the phone seems to be in really good condition I just wish that discoloration in the top corner wasn‚Äôt there"
"iPhone 13 mini","If I didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd bought a used phone, I would have thought this was new. The battery is at 100% health, I can‚Äôt find any blemishes on the screen or backing, and everything booted up like new. The package even came with a new charging cable and a charging brick. I didn‚Äôt need another brick but it‚Äôs nice that it was there I guess."
"iPhone 13 mini","I liked that it could fit in a pocket easily But I needed my glasses to be able to see it and I just need a little extra space I went to the 13 regular but overall I really like the phone it‚Äôs got a lot of features and smooth transitions"
"iPhone 13 mini","The mini was smaller than my old IPhone 6. I thought they were the same size. However I am happy to be able to use all my Apps now! The old phone did not support a lot of Apps. Everything set up great and no glitches in getting it activated! Love it!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered a pre owned iPhone 13 mini. It arrived in 48 hrs after ordering, much quicker than stated by the seller :) This phone was flawless on the exterior. It has always charged to 100% in the 10 days I have been using it. I have been using it. All other features have full functionality. I‚Äôm so glad I made this choice. Kudos to the seller and the top notch quality of this iPhone 13 mini!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I needed a new iPhone and I wanted to see if I could save some cash by buying refurbished. The iPhone 13 mini I received was like new no scratches whatsoever. Very pleased. I ended up saving damn near $100 enough to get me a case and screen protector with left over money."
"iPhone 13 mini","Zero issues, good service and Great phone condition, I loved it."
"iPhone 13 mini","My face recognition is not available, my battery life was at 91% and at first i could not download any apps that didn‚Äôt come with the phone without a credit card. Other than that, the screen and no scratches or cracks and the phone had no dents."
"iPhone 13 mini","Quick delivery, excellent product condition and great pricing!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Like new. It‚Äôs been working perfectly for a few months now. 100% battery and processor health. Great buy so far."
"iPhone 13 mini","This iPhone turned out to be everything I expected it to be."
"iPhone 13 mini","Came without box but the ph is in great condition."
"iPhone 13 mini","Like new no problems even overseas"
"iPhone 13 mini","I love my phone I got the color pink I order my phone and come the next day pacifically a day early. Which I was surprise and every happy when I receive it if u trying to save money just buy it it‚Äôs worth the money it didn‚Äôt come with the box which I didn‚Äôt really care for and it didn‚Äôt come a SIM card which was okay with I was just happy to have the phone so yes u should buy this"
"iPhone 13 mini","llego 1 dia antes de lo esperado, esteticamente esta bien. reconocimiento facial bien, camara bien, carga rapida, lo que mas me sorprendio fue que tiene 100% de capacidad en la bateria"
"iPhone 13 mini","esta bien para ser reparado"

"iPhone 13 mini","Really outstanding quality other than very minor scratches I covered up with a screen protector it looked brand new"
"iPhone 13 mini","Pagu√© un buen precio. Me llego con 100% de bater√≠a y como nuevo.

"iPhone 13 mini","Such a beautiful phone. Perfect in hand! Lovely colour and great quality phone! Buy it! You won‚Äôt regret!"
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone is perfect, absolutely no sign of previous use. Would buy from them again."
"iPhone 13 mini","The IPhone 13 Mini is perfect for my use.
I love it. Price was very reasonable too."
"iPhone 13 mini","Dicen que es ""como nuevo"" pero la realidad es que literalmente est√° nuevo"
"iPhone 13 mini","Si no supiera que es reacondicionado pasar√≠a por nuevo, excelente celular con un 99% de condici√≥n de bater√≠a, lleg√≥ con un cable lightning"
"iPhone 13 mini","Looks like the iPhone 13 but fails to provide all the bells and whistles of the real phone, I upgraded from an iPhone SE and the face camera picture quality is identical, the phone will sometimes hick up and glitch a little when changing between apps, doesn't come with the iPhone 13 wall papers and settings, did not come with the recent iPhone 12 update.

Walks like a iPhone 13, quacks like one, but just isn't the same. I understand this may be how refurbished phones are but I was expecting it to feel more like the actual iPhone 13."
"iPhone 13 mini","I really like my new phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","shipping fast and battery health 100%. like new condition. Huge value for cost."

"iPhone 13 mini","Phone came today and inspected right out of the box. No scratches or chips. Battery health is at 100% as well! Very happy with the purchase and will update if anything goes awry."
"iPhone 13 mini","Buena compra"
"iPhone 13 mini","The smartphone, taken separately, is in excellent condition. There is no problem.

The only downside is that it is not in the original box. The USB cable is also not original. This is a little bad.
However, the phone itself is in perfect condition."
"iPhone 13 mini","It looks brand new and battery is still at 100% capacity, no scratch except 2 hair line scratch on the screen but only noticeable when close-up. I installed glass screen protector and its not noticeable anymore."
"iPhone 13 mini","Great product and battery life is hundred percent. There is a little scratch on screen but is not that prominent"
"iPhone 13 mini","I purchased an iPhone mini 13 ‚Ä¶shipping was fast ‚Ä¶the device was as described‚Ä¶ It even came with a cable and a charger..and 100% battery health."

"iPhone 13 mini","Easy set up, no problems, good condition. Worth while purchase!"
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone itself is perfectly fine. But the charging cable it comes with is obviously the cheapest one they could get, but it does work. The power brick on the other hand, feels so cheap and has minimal markings on it indicating its safety, that I immediately threw it in the trash and recommend that everyone else does the same. The listing description also says that it comes with a SIM removal tool, which it did not.

If you're just here for the phone, and don't care about everything else it comes with, then this thing is great."
"iPhone 13 mini","Nice, for a good price!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I'm not an iPhone user but bought this for my future wife and omg..looks brand new! Can't wait to give it to her in 2month oversea. I hope nothing is wrong since I only turn it on to make sure there's no Crack during shipping. A+ so far until she geeks out on it."
"iPhone 13 mini","I love this phone, it looked brand new and works fantastic and shipping was quick!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Great iPhone I give it 5 ‚ú®"
"iPhone 13 mini","It came in great shape and I was extremely surprised but extremely satisfied"
"iPhone 13 mini","Great product not damages whatsoever, battery life 100%."
"iPhone 13 mini","Was a bit hesitant to buy renewed, but very pleasantly surprised. Phone was in perfect condition, no noticeable blemishes or scratches, battery at 100% capacity, warranty still active per Apple coverage check. Would definitely buy Amazon renewed again."
"iPhone 13 mini","This phone came in immaculate condition and has 100% battery life. Also cheaper than brand new. What more could you ask for in a renewed phone? This is my first time buying from amazon renewed. Amazing first impression. I will be back for my next."
"iPhone 13 mini","Works like brand new no scratches or visible damage very happy with the cheaper phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","They replaced the original screen with a cheaper version that really contrast poorly compared to the original oled screen"
"iPhone 13 mini","Was surprised when I saw the phone. Basically brand new with no scratches or dents. Battery life isn‚Äôt the best ,but that‚Äôs a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make for the size"
"iPhone 13 mini","My girlfriend loves her new iphone it came in perfect condition no scratches or bumps first time buying a renewed phone from amazon and it was worth buying for."
"iPhone 13 mini","El cable del cargador no sirve. El tel√©fono tiene una raya en la pantalla."
"iPhone 13 mini","Good phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","I had this delivered less than 10 mins ago and it arrived scrapped. The top right portion was scrapped as well as a minor one on the bottom right. The charging port and cable are not Apple brand, they are second hand brands. I have submitted my return request and will be expecting my money back. Overall this phone took about a week to get here and couldn‚Äôt even use it when it finally did get here. I will create an update if my refund is not returned in a timely manner."
"iPhone 13 mini","Perfect and battery life 100% no dents no scratch
Packaging was a lil scruffy but it‚Äôs used ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"iPhone 13 mini","Although my iPhone 13 mini is a renewed product, it looks like new. The battery health is also at 100 percent."
"iPhone 13 mini","Like new"
"iPhone 13 mini","Phone is basically new with no use or one time use. Battery 100%. Good deal!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Lleg√≥ en perfecto estado. No tiene ning√∫n defecto"

"iPhone 13 mini","It‚Äôs a good little phone. My came looking brand new."
"iPhone 13 mini","exelect"
"iPhone 13 mini","Todo bien, todo lo que comenta el vendedor es lo que entrega"
"iPhone 13 mini","Absolutely perfect. No flaws inside or out.
Battery life is incredible."
"iPhone 13 mini","Like"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone with great hopes to replace my old Iphone 8 and I thought for a 512gb it was a steal price. After having it for 3 days, it showed signs of defects with the camera and videos (lines on the side of the pictures/videos recorded) I really wanted to keep this phone but I returned it for the reason that it won‚Äôt probably last me longer than 1 year and it would show more defects over time. With this experience I probably won‚Äôt be buying any renewed phone EVER. Just buy the brand new item and add the extra $80 to keep it working for years than the risk of having a problem within a week/year is high with these type of renewed phones."
"iPhone 13 mini","The seller sent the wrong phone - i ordered a 13 mini but the seller delivered a 12 mini. I ordered a red phone - the seller delivered a white one. Most importantly, the phone is borken. It does not recognize any of several valid, working SIM cards that I and my cell provider tried in it. Further, amazon made it difficult to return this item. I've thus had to contest the charge with my credit card company. IMHO Wal-Mart provides a better on-line shopping experience."
"iPhone 13 mini","received phone in good physical condition, however it is carrier locked and the description clearly says UNLOCKED. for the price of the phone renewed, it is better to buy it new. never again!"
"iPhone 13 mini","i purchased this product in June 2022 and gifted to my cuisine who is staying in different county . But last week i came to know that Battery is fully drained and not able switching ON.
They are thinking that i gifted poor quality product."
"iPhone 13 mini","looks so cheap, not impressive"
"iPhone 13 mini","For some reason while I was talking on the phone, the screen just randomly turned green. It never went away and there was nothing on YOUTUBE or google to explain the problem. Took it to a local business that fixes phones but they said that its the screen that is damaged and it stems from the actual manufacturer. They must have used a lower quality screen. It's going to cost me about $200 to fix apparently. It's sad because the phone was great up until two weeks of using it. Very disappointed with my purchase."
"iPhone 13 mini","El tel√©fono es renovado pero deb√≠a verse como nuevo. La pantalla ten√≠a rayones raz√≥n por la cual realic√© la devoluci√≥n."
"iPhone 13 mini","only lasted a few months and now will not turn on. Phone has entered a boot loop and is now an expensive paper weight."
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought an Iphone 13 mini Unlocked right? Well when trying to connect it to my carrier it would not work, kept giving me an error message. Went in and looked‚Ä¶LOCKED with T-Mobile. I had to take the phone to T-Mobile to get it unlocked which was not free. With the money I spent I should have bought a brand new one. The company selling this device was rude and would not listen to the problem I was having. If I could give this company -5 stars I would!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I brought the Apple 13 mini UNLOCKED! When I received my product it wasn‚Äôt unlocked, it was with sprint. I checked my order and it said I purchased unlock. After many phone calls with Sprint they couldn‚Äôt unlock the phone because the previous owner did not have the phone for 40 days active with them. I contacted the seller and all they did was ask me for my IMEI code on the phone. My phone is still LOCKED. Will update soon."
"iPhone 13 mini","Save your money. This phone is awful. It freezes constantly. The keypad is so far off texting is a nightmare. The facial recognition works about fifty percent of the time. It is so slow‚Ä¶ my 8 year old iphone 8 was faster"
"iPhone 13 mini","Phone has many scratches even thought said it was like new and not great battery life"
"iPhone 13 mini","No es bueno"
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone unlocked and when I finally got it after order was delayed 3 times it wasn‚Äôt even unlocked like it said"
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","The battery life is really good.But the iPhone was scratched and dirtyIt's not worth buying"
"iPhone 13 mini","Won't connect to my carrier, even though it's supposed to be unlocked. So either it's locked or the sim slot is busted."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","Freezes and cuts off randomly, at least 5 times a day. Will be returning soon if problems persist."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone partly based on the reviews posted here and have to say it met my high expectations. My suspicion is that these are possibly just display models that are sold off as for all intents and purposes the phone shipped to me was new. No scratches or blemishes were on it and it has 100% remaining battery life. It had an out of date software version needing upgrading before use which tells me it had probably never been connected to wifi or a cell provider before and possibly never even turned on which is how it appears. The only little drawback that happened is that I didn‚Äôt receive the Color I ordered, however that is not the fault of the seller as the Color marked on the product box was not what was inside. Based on my experience I wholeheartedly recommend buying from this site."
"iPhone 13 mini","These phones are still priced as if the MSRP is 699$. Apple reduced the brand new price of this phone to 599 2 months ago... making these an awful value at 579$ when you can get it brand new with an apple warranty for 599. I'd not consider a less then excellent condition renewed product at anything more then 450$ at this point."
"iPhone 13 mini","Good price for a nice and non scratched iphone. Even though it came with no adaptor the seller is supportive to accept return.."
"iPhone 13 mini","I purchased this iPhone Mini recently (even if not through Amazon). A critical issue keeps coming up that is making me think I've made a mistake. Apple has failed to update to the newest standard of texting. Why? Tim Cook has said ""buy your mom an iPhone"" if you want texting to work nicely with her.So when I get photos texted in a thread where there is even just a single non-Apple device in the group chat, *all* images comes in as low-res photo in the thread. That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple's actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device. This is madness, and at times I'm now finding myself embarrassed to own an iPhone."
"iPhone 13 mini","The raves are seductive, maybe the colors, too. But once inside, unless you are a pixel-fixated addict, many things may leave you wanting. No home button, No touch ID! Camera fixtures protruding from the back side produce a rather scabby look and feel, so unlike a Steve Jobs design, no? And a technically ‚Äúlarger‚Äù screen than the SE, but as skinny as a tunnel.All of which, up close in hand, made it easy for me to commit to the SE 2022. Feels solid. Feels fine enough. I will forever miss my original SE, how light in weight. Apple had to blow that, too."
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought it in excellent condition. But on the phone itself there were a couple scratches. Gunk in a few spots too. Wouldn‚Äôt say it was excellent condition. Would‚Äôve bought brand new if I knew. The phone internally is okay. But if you want a new phone In excellent condition id honestly just go to Best Buy and spend like a 100 more to get your moneys worth."
"iPhone 13 mini","Me hicieron un cambio de color antes de enviarlo por que me equivoqu√© de color al pedirlo.Todo a funcionado Perfecto.Sin problemas de Env√≠o. Lleg√≥ antes de lo esperado. Feliz!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Ordered iPhone 13 Mini in Midnight 128gb. Product came as described in perfect condition with 100% battery health. Even came with an apple brick and MFI cable. Definitely recommend"
"iPhone 13 mini","Thos os my 6th phone. I have had so m8ch trouble with cell phones. Now I am pleased with the one I chose!!!!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Buyer beware, Amazon guarantee states ""The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.""Mine arrived with multiple small blemishes on the screen that looked like dust/fine hair, but can't be wiped off - invisible from 12 inches away, but who only uses a phone a foot away from their head.Highly recommend the 13 mini -- Great camera, battery life, and performance. I would advise against Amazon renewed though."
"iPhone 13 mini","Great deal good phone"
"iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone a few weeks ago. It came with a screen protector already on and is in pristine condition. No scratches or dings. Battery at 100% capacity. So happy with the phone!"
"iPhone 13 mini","Arrived in 3 days, even though I was worried about the condition of a used iPhone, I was so surprised by the product.Not even a small scratch, camera, faceID is working properly and the phone itself is so fast. Even more shocking that the battery health is on 100.Came with a third party USB-A to lightning cable which I wouldn‚Äôt use and with a SIM-tool.I can highly recommend renewed products now."
"iPhone 13 mini","The phone came in a good condition, although there were small almost un-noticeable scratches. It also arrived right on time. Even got a free screen protector installed! The small form factor is absolutely amazing and I love how effective and efficient it is. I got it in the midnight colour and I am completely inlove!"
"iPhone 13 mini","13 mini works great showed up in great condition !"
"iPhone 13 mini","Absolutely like new. Was given a power brick and new cable as well. Definitely worth it.Give recycled tech a go, it goes a long way."
"iPhone 13 mini","Muy buen producto"
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 the phone came in with no scratches or dents the Battery health was at a surprising 98% The face id works like a charm. Also this is my first time buying a renewed device."

"iPhone 13 mini","Llego azul enlugar de negro pero funciona 100%. Con Telcel Mexico
Bateria 98%"
"iPhone 13 mini","I was scared in the beginning if renewed would be scratched or dented but luckily it was just like a brand new. Unfortunately, had to return since it was too smal for us but it was like brand new."
"iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"iPhone 13 mini","Came a day earlier than expected, and in perfect condition. No scratches or visible damage and battery at 100% capacity. So happy!"
"iPhone 13 mini","I bought the phone brand new with Apple's great guarantee and care, overnight Fedex shipping and paid less than this phone used on Amazon. If the phone were priced at the right price, I would likely have bought it here."
"iPhone 13 mini","I love this phone it works great it rlly fits me because my hands are super duper small overall good quality everything works i suggest getting a fast charger to charge your phone because my charger works with the case !"
"iPhone 13 mini","Good warranty perfect looked brand new for being refurbished no network issues very small good size"
"iPhone 13 mini","THIS WAS ALMOST A NEW PHONE.Guys. If you are looking for a ""used"" phone that's literally not even used, this is where you get it from. Make sure you select the refurbished in excellent condition one. It is practically a new phone. Only thing is, it did not come in the OEM box. But oh wow..... So cool. A white box that you won't really care about. Yeah. This is basically a new phone. Still an Apple product, but a great one nonetheless."
"iPhone 13 mini","This case feels like much better quality than the otterbox case I previously had installed.Pros: It feels like good quality. Perfect fit. Materials definitely seem better than otter box. The edge has much better grip feeling than other cases I‚Äôve had. You get to show off the color of your phone..?Cons: the raised edge around the cameras doesn‚Äôt seem like it is much higher than the camera lenses."
"iPhone 13 mini","El equipo anda estupendo, la mica plastica que viene puesta trae unas rayas que no tienen importancia ya que se cambia por una nueva, estoy feliz con mi compra, llego super r√°pido ademas y bien protegido en su caja de amazon :) recomiendo totalmente a este vendedor"
"iPhone 13 mini","I normally don't go for renewed or refurbished phones since I like to buy them new but decided to give it a try here since it was much cheaper than what's on Apple's website. I wasn't disappointed. Received all the parts and for all purposes, I can't tell that this phone has been used before"
