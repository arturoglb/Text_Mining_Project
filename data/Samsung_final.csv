"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I love the phone so far its a 5 stars but only thing that i dont like is that it doesn't have earphones if they would come with the phone i will give a 5 stars"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Hi, I am seeking assistance to have my purchased Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (new) replaced. When I initially began using this phone, I realized it would sometime feel warm, which I did take seriously. This phone worked for 37 days; then it started freezing/sticking and coming on and off. It then came off completely, and after giving it some charge, it only shows the word 'SAMSUNG.' The power button is not responding despite numerous tries.
I bought this phone to continue my online classes, which will resume in the first week of September 2022. Your consideration in the matter would be much appreciated. Thank you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","It's very good but it's no 5G.so that's wrong description. Battery life is to short."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I am Using this phone with the Dual-Sim option.
Slot 1 is Verizon wireless, which is working without any problems.
- SMS texts messaging, phone calls and Internet services are available

Slot 2 is running on a German Sim Card, that is working with Roaming on the T-Mobile network
- All Services are available as well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Slower than I expected. Otherwise, I like the features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I wanted this phone so bad and I could not activate it. This is an international version, so, if you are in the USA even though it says is unlocked won't work with any company. I am about to return it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","generally I don't buy samsung phones but this one I bought as it has good feature with low price. after using it a while, it works great and battery life stays around more than a day. so far performance is good, hope for future."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I said before that I really like the phone, but, thought it didn't have an sd slot. I was wrong, it is on the back of the sim card. At first, I was concerned about it being ""international"", however, no problems."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Good value for money, battery life. But having a difficulty installing Samsung Pay since it says its an issue with where I bought the device. This was extremely unexpected and is a bit frustrating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Love it! I live in the Caribbean and the phone works great so it's definitely unlocked. Just remember it doesn't have a plug for earphones..I completely forgot awhile ago when I went to plug in my earphones ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I'm very pleased with my order this is exactly what I've been wanting, came pretty fast too 2 days early also the phone is brand new and works perfectly with my service"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Amazing phone! Even with the Exynos 990, I haven't experienced any hiccups or lag. Beast of a phone, with 120hz refresh. Battery is fairly good, even with the reported problem with the LTE variant."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","So far I am loving my new phone! It may be last year's model but it has more than what I need! Plus it was way more affordable than the S21!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","A lot of features for the price ,good phone highly recommend it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","At the begining, It won't work. until the phone being updated. Now it works like a champ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","The product arrived on time but when I opened the box there was a European charger and a converter for us plugs.
I picked up the phone and for some reason I just did not like it so I returned it the next day.
Unlike most things I buy on Amazon it cost me money to return it and that I did not like. 23 bucks including insurance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Good phone with terrible battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Phone overheat alot"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","No issue with the phone at all, gave this as a gift to my boyfriend for Christmas. Works amazing! Thank you so much!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","It was not full unlocked as described."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","The product worked as described by seller"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","A very tidy operator!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Bought a phone for my husband in another country. Took it to him, turned it on, complete malfunction. Took it to a repair shop who said it was not fixable and throw its away. Contacted seller, they are standing behind the 30 day policy, what a scam. Horrible horrible."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","The modle you get is a SM-G780F/DSM which is not compatible with AT&T Services starting 02/22/2022. That is a big difference if you receive a SM-G780F or a SM-G780F/DSM. Buyer beware what you get."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This phone didn't work at all for phone calls, didn't get any reception, after i have to spend in a new sim card and money to transfer all the apps and data was not useful at the time to make a call. Also is still a 4 g phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Purchased for business associate in another country on March 9, 2021. He‚Äôs just now started using the phone and the battery overheats and won‚Äôt hold a charge. I‚Äôve lost $538 because Suntrade LLC /Amazon sent me a bad phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I was surprised to find out that this phone could not be activated with Verizon (at least not in the US). I feel that should be more clear in the description. I've returned it and all, but thought I'd write a review to warn others. Thank you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This phone is not compatible with Verizon/Sprint. That important information is nowhere in the ad. A sticker on outward packaging says not eligible for return if opened. We did receive the refund on a timely basis when we returned it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","For an expensive phone like this one there no earpiece or ear buds, no memory card, no phone cases ,no screen protector. This is so ridiculous. I will not recommend any body to buy this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","The phone is advertised to be able to accept two sim cards, however the phone I received is only able to accept one sim card and one SD card. I require two sim cards for international business travel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This product is not meant to be sold in the US not. Not compatible with carriers and it looks used when advertised as new"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Nevy blue Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
Hitting to much.I returned the selphone.
It is helpful?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This phone always confuses which phone number I use to call or text."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","The phone stopped getting signal and sending messages"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This phone is overheating if I use it for 2 hours"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This phone seems like it was rushed to production. The battery is worse than my 2.5 year old phone. Samsung's version of Android is terrible and has ads. I wish I hadn't bought this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Very good üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","My son is very happy with his pick of this phone. The battery life is amazing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Great phone!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Really decent phone for the price and battery life is much better than expected!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Fingerprint reader is slower than ur reg S9 hardware reader.

Phone is good.
120hz is cool but meh.
Good phone for 500 bucks."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Love love love this phone. Absolutely no problems with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","i think i made a very wise decision when I bought this phone. with the features and specifications that it has, no wonder some say that it was the best phone in its range. if you are looking for a high spec but has a limited budget, this phone is the best choice!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Battery is worse than battery test :))"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","This arrived in just a few days via FEDEX with no problems at all.
Be aware that the charger included is the massive European plug from Samsung. You will need an adapter.
As far as the phone, it is a great phone with a great camera. Well worth the budget-friendly price compared to the more expensive options available."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","It ships from Hong Kong. You have to pay $20 customs.
Charger is not compatible with Canada.
So far it works, will update review later"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is amazing! I had a
galaxy s8, the phones pretty much work the same however, the s20+ 5G is so much faster and the screen quality is excellent. The phone came 2 days after I ordered it. It's fully unlocked. You just need your own sim card.. It's a great buy!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this new phone during Amazon Prime days and was unable to activate it with my carrier (Verizon). I had to take it to the carrier's store and was there for an hour, when they discovered that the 5G phone had a 4G Sims card. I had to go back to the store a second time for another hour to finally resolve this issue. In addition to the time spent in these stores, the store had to contact their support time both times - with wait times 18 minutes or longer for them. I finally had to purchase a 5G SIMS card and they had to uninstall and reinstall the activation. I will never buy any electronics from Amazon in the future, even the protector I bought for the screen in a 'bundle' was defective and I had to purchase a new one as it came out of the box with a large scratch across the middle of the protector. There is a reason why you get such a 'great' deal on these products - out of three products included in the bundle, two were defective. Although I purchase items through Amazon weekly, I am going to be purchasing a new TV in the next week and I will not purchase it through Amazon as I know there is a good chance it will be defective as well. Very disappointed with my own decision to go through Amazon instead of my own carrier for my new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The Galaxy S20 line is the last line of Samsung Galaxy phones that has room for an external micro SD card.
The cameras are great. I've loved all of my Galaxys, but unfortunately, this one is refurbished and not new as described."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","5G
This unit ""SM-G986UZKAXAA"" Only supports US 5G carriers, 5G will not work Europe, Asia, or the middle east.
The listings and official samsung product site simply say (5G ready). But fail to mention the 5G bands.
This model supports the following bands: nr2600(n38,n7), nr3700(n77).

Snapdragon
This model is the SnapDragon variant, which is the preferred version over the other variants which run exynos.

E-Sim
This model does not support E-Sim.

The specs listed for this device are contradictory.
The product listing title says ""Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G Factory Unlocked"",
but under product information it says:
""Wireless communication technologies 4G"".

Amazon Customer Support has confirmed this is the 5G unit. I've requested the product specs to be updated and corrected so that others dont get confused, this has not been done. Looks like Samsung doesnt care about the accuracy of its listings."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is a very good phone. I really like it.
Main disadvantages of this phone are:
- lack of 3.5mm headphone jack,
- it's pretty big, and it's not easy to use with one hand,
- it's very expensive, and honestly it's doesn't worth more than $1000 at all, there are a lot of other good phones with the same or about the same specifications for way lower price.

What I don't like is that phone arrived in questionable condition. The box of that phone was definitely opened before, so actual description was supposed to be ""Open box"", but not ""New"". This phone also had a lot of dust on it, things packed inside of the box were definitely packed not the same way as they usually packed from the factory, and screen protector that was already applied on this phone had couple of little scratches/dents on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone, ready to use, unlocked, just plug and play. it appear to have some glue dots on the screen, after detail inspection, it has a front plastic transparent cover that can be removed. after this. phone looks and feels great. works perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is ""okay"". The only real problem I have with it is that when it comes to making calls sometimes I can't hear the other person at all. I have to restart the phone and then it works most of the time. As we all know it's not a very good phone if it fails to do what it is primarily needed for."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this phone several months ago. Battery is draining very fast and autofocusing is a nightmare!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The in screen fingerprint reader is fantastic. I have very very sweaty hands and my old Google pixel always had issues. Granted this also struggles at times with my sweat but not nearly as much as any other phone I have tried. Works great the first time dry and easily within 2 or 3 tries wet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Really glad to have made the change from my well functioning S7. Picture is super sharp and colors are wonderful. Runs much faster with internet. Size makes it easier to read. Camera is SO sophisticated. Conversion from S7 was very easy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I returned the product sadly because I preferred the Ultra. Ended up being that the Ultra had a camera focus problem so I wished I had chosen the plus instead."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I like it it was sold by Amazon and is unlocked so you can activate it to any phone plan and or service it arrived quick and as expected of a new phone with everything included"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","upgraded to this from the s9 and I love it. the only thing that feels like a downgrade is the fingerprint reader. the one on the back of the s9 was faster and rarely took more than one try. the reader in the screen seems to be more picky."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Good product, but didn't arrive with the wireless headset that was supposed to be included when I bought this phone.
Is it delayed?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Fingerprint reader only works sometimes. Battery life is great. With the new 21 coming out, it would nice if this would have been less."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Excellent phone! My son is VERY HAPPY with face recognition and fingerprint reader. Highly sarisfied üëçüëçüëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Very happy with the phone. I broke my s10plus and upgraded to this and have no complaints. Great performance, no bugs so far, battery life is good, and the screen has an excellent picture."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Nothing to dislike about this phone. Fingerprint reader works even through the screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone is great, do not use the fingerprint reader or bixby......Fast processor, camera is great.....4 stars only because no phone is worth 1K."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Having upgraded from a Samsung s5, I am now operating on all cylinders! The features and the battery life are great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone and signal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Face and fingerprint recognition is horrible. I had a One Plus which worked flawlessly. When you pay a thousand dollars for a phone I would expect the recognition software to work flawlessly like the less expensive competition model."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I use this phone primarily for gaming, solid performance! Usually lasts me 10+ hours of straight gaming settings on high, then of course I have to plug a charger in. But 10+ hours, you can't beat it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone was great and has done great since I bought last year!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Awesome plenty ram micro SD card plenty of storage do not need cloud"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","absolutely love this phone no problems whatsoever . Easliy get a full day on a battery possibly 2 full days with a lot of activity on it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone, I got what I ordered,"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Excellent battery life and NO connection problems with my cricket wireless network"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Got it earlier than expected, exactly as describe. I love it works like new in excellent condition you will not be disappointed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone! Fast, long battery life, big screen. Amazing camera! Super fast charging."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","only issue is fingerprint reader doesn't work with screen protector"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this device in August 2021 and at the end of September of 2021 it stopped taking a charge. It said there was moisture in the device, even though I did not have it near water and it's supposed to be waterproof. After putting in a bag of rice for a day, it turned back on and took a charge. Then one week later it did the same thing again. While trying to see what we could do, we found out that they sold a device to us that was out of warranty, which was not disclosed in the description. Do NOT purchase this product; it's not worth losing $500+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this phone for all the features it has but am extremely disappointed with the phone. The finger print scanner doesn't work half the time and the battery life is terrible.

I ended up returning this phone because it's not working as advertised and for over a thousand dollars no way would I put up with this.

I bought the phone unlocked but it still came with bloatware you cannot remove like Facebook, Netflix and some random Samsung apps.

Very disappointed and not what I expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Return"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Wife loved upgrade. Phone is awesome."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","My phone came absolutely spotless. Just like new! Everything works great! Came just as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Works perfect on uscellular. No issues with phone at all. Love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Awesome phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I don't know why Samsung insists on using the curved display. It is incredibly weak. I have owned this for less than two months. I put a protective case on it. However, there is no way to put a screen protector on it. For one, the screen is curved. And secondly, the fingerprint recognition on the case prevents screen protectors from being used. My phone just fell on top of the cable for my charger and shattered. A cable...on top of a soft carpet... Not concrete. Not metal. A cable broke the phone screen. So my brand new expensive phone is going to need to be replaced before it gets worse. Needless to say, my next phone will NOT be a Samsung until they stop making that curved display. How does Samsung think this is acceptable?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","With this model something its wrong.Its very bad working with Lyft application. Every time when I get alarm notification from Lyft app my music from phone stoped play in my car media device and continue play after 7-10 second. Sometimes even disconnect Bluetooth after Lyft notification. I try all ,but nothing no help my.My old Samsung 9+ worked excellent,I never had problem."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Amazing phone 10/10 I highly recommend buying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love the phone and had no problems with it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","So for so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone keeps acting up keeps saying no Sim and not letting you call out thought it just needed to be updated but still having the same problem which sucks to pay so much for a phone with constant issues"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this phone for my husband he finally used it and the screen is cracked you can see a pixe line across the phone. Videos are recorded but they don‚Äôt come out correctly they freeze and they speed up the phone ruined some very precious family videos. If i could return it i would but we never open the phone till last week. It was in a brand new non open box. never had this issue with any phone. very disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone takes great pics. Unfortunately, I had to return the phone because it had 3 chips in the glass. I'm still waiting 2 1/2 was later to get a refund."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This listing says unlocked, but I received a sprint phone. It wouldn't take my AT&T SIM card and the settings show brand as Sprint. Don't trust it if it says unlocked. Edit: second time I bought this phone specifically because it said ""yes at&t and factory unlocked"". As soon as I turn on the phone it said Verizon. Stop advertising factory unlocked when it clearly is not."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","If you use Samsung pass be very careful it is very difficult to wipe and factory reset I've never had such difficulty wiping a phone to factory reset I must have changed my password 10 times very very difficult Samsung get to work on this crap it's so much easier for Google and way easier for iOS but for the Samsung phones that are coming out buyer beware."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I don't know what is wrong with the phone, but the screen is especially susceptible to scratching. 4 or 5 scratches in less than a month.

I have owned a galaxy s3, s5 and s8 before and have never had this problem. Garbage for a $1000 phone.

No, I don't have a screen protector. I have never used one. I have never needed one until I purchased this piece of garbage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Decent phone, horrendous camera software.

Using this in July 2020 fully updated: pictures are excessively auto adjusted with no options to disable. Especially when the subject is people or pets (90+% of a cell phone cameras use case!): saturation gets absurd, colors are brightened (skin tones are made pale) , and everything in general just looks like a cheap filter from a 3rd graders first attempt at photoshop."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This is a terrible phone. The fingerprint reader is very finicky, it is almost impossible to take a screenshot, Android Auto doesn't work, and the Samsung apps are garbage. I feel ripped off. Don't buy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It worked for 2 months and the display went black. Sent text to seller with no reply."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone is fine but don't buy from Amazon. 1000 dollar phone and not a single cushion pack, beat up box. Yes Amazon, I love my new phone pre-drop tested."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone froze and can not restart, charge, or unlock it 19 days after return date
expired."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Leave it to samsung to F up a android phone.
Now to get rid of this samsung abortion of a phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It did not come with complete items"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Battery is bad"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I am a Samsung lover and was genuinely excited for this, I even pre-ordered it. Not even a week and I'm sending it back. I can't take it anymore. It's buggy like a prototype, not the most expensive phone on the market.

Id take an old disposable camera over this supposedly next gen camera system. It gets a ""warning, camera failed"" notification several times a day that makes the camera inoperable until I restart it. I can take better pictures out of a moving vehicle with my crappy Pixel2 after my dogs lick the camera than I can with this thing in a tripod. It has a bizzarre focus, color tints, and lighting problems, even if you turn off all the enhancing features and line up the dots exactly like it orders you too. If you don't hold it still for a solid 10s before and after a picture, the picture will be blurry like you're waving it around at a rave. Dark light just plain doesn't work. I'm uploading some of my best pictures as an example.

In addition to the camera problems, it already has dead pixels despite never being dropped and always kept in a case/screen protector. And the screen is almost impossible to ""hard press"" even with the sensitivity turned all the way up, so much so that I have to set it on a hard surface and lean on it.

And all of that is BEFORE I spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to return the thing, because it's well within the return window but they're subtracting a mystery ""adjustment"" of $300 and no one can tell me why, just that I have to call back after they've failed to credit the whole amount back and fight it then. (I bought it directly through the Samsung website)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The phone is great. The super bummer is the position of the fingerprint reader, so inconvenient and annoying how dificult it is to get the phone to read it, maybe without any screen protectors will read better but we all need screen protectors"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I didn't buy this phone through Amazon like I do for 95% of my purchases but I can tell you that it's incredibly fast, it's picture is incredibly detailed, the volume level is spectacularly high (and clear), and I'm so glad I bought it. I have the S20+ and feel like I am working with a new age machine. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the slightly inconsistent fingerprint and facial scans. This new ""super fast"" charging that I do through the plug, not wireless, charges up my phone ~90% in 1 hour, and that's sick!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Has full spectrum of US 5G. So far have ""only"" gotten 300 Mbs in the US on T-Mobile. Hoping for better in future, but that is still great.

Has pre-installed screen protector, which is a great advantage, especially as I find customer-installed screen protectors do not last.

3X optical zoom is very useful.

Wish it had dual SIMs in US, but the SD card is great as only need the 128 GB model and can add 256 SD card (or greater) at small additional cost."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","My headline needs no explanation on how much I love Samsung phones. Reliable phone, and can go for upgrade every 2 years for new features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this phone directly from Samsung during their pre-order, traded in my S10+ .... I have this phone running through Boostmobile, no issues whatsoever... Superfast phone, battery life is great..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It's a phone. Camera is capable of having a wider photos to capture what your eye can see, but you usually don't use it. Everytime I bought this I keep thinking, why in the heck did I buy 1200 phone for something my S9+ did just fine but needed a new battery? Bixbi is horrible. Want to turn off the phone? They took out the stupid power button for bixbi."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought it for $750 off of Microsoft's website."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Hate where the finger print sensor is and it doesn't work properly. Hate the drop away buttons. They should have keep the old style buttons, or at least kept them where they were. The fingerprint sensor in the middle of the screen is SO stupid, it takes me at least 3 tries to unlock the phone. Digital buttons would be fine the drop away would be ok, the finger print sensor being where it is is lame."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I wanted to love the Galaxy S20 plus. It was my first Samsung phone since the Note 5. But the battery is NOT long lasting - this phone could not even keep up with my 19+ months old Huawei Mate 20, EVEN WITH aggressive power saving turned on medium settings. So no 120hz screen, no QHD resolution, reduced brightness, no apps running in background, and CPU throttled to 70%, and the battery life STILL couldn't make it through the day without needing a charge. I'm guessing this is because of all the redundant Samsung apps and bloatware making the operating system very inefficient. The poor battery life renders most of the premium features like the screen and processor moot. Battery life is the single MOST important spec for any phone - the spec upon which all other specs depend.

The other problem is the in-screen fingerprint reader is slow and innacurate, definitely a step backwards from the dedicated fingerprint reader on the back of the phone on my Mate 20. I don't know why manufacturers thought it was necessary to put it in screen in the first place. Trendiness over functionality is something I'd expect from Apple.

Trying the Oneplus 8 and hoping it's decent now that Huawei phones have become casualties of the US-China trade war. Otherwise the P40 Pro would have been my top choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I'm sure there are a lot of good things about this phone, but it is terrible at everything that matters to me.

The camera is TERRIBLE. Everything is washed out, or the brights are blown out. Also, you can't play music and take a video at the same time - what is this, 2015? Camera is the most important thing in a phone for me, so I exchanged for a pixel 5.

Also a bummer that there's no fingerprint reader (well, there is, but it literally never worked at all). The face recognition was not as reliable as the fingerprint reader on my pixel - it didn't recognize me if I was wearing sunglasses or in bright light or holding the phone at a slightly different angle from the pictures I took to set up face recognition. It seems like face recognition is where most people want phones to go, but I prefer fingerprint because apps with biometric locks use fingerprints but not face."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I have been a lifelong Samsung phone user. I bought the S20 5G+ for Sprint from Samsung.com. The phone does not have as good of a reception as the old S9+ I traded it in for (tried to trade in anyway). It has a tendency to drop a lot of calls where I used to have constant reception.

On another note, Samsung promised me $350 for my trade as long as the screen wasn't cracked, it powered on and it was factory reset. I did all the above. Samsung said they would not give me the credit because ""You did not disable your personal security locks, including the Factory Reset Protection or Activation Lock"", which was not a requirement, and, BTW, should have been taken care of when I did the ""Factory Reset"". Given Samsung's shady business practices, I will no longer be a Samsung buyer and I hope to spread the word to encourage others not to buy Samsung. If they treat people this way, who knows what else they will do?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I was so excited to upgrade from my S7 edge. Unfortunately I have been super disappointed and actually wish I wouldn't have switched. First of all, it's way too big. I thought the s7 was perfect size, this is just a little bit bigger but for me it's WAY too big. Finger print scanner is garbage. I pretty much always just have to key in my security code. It does have face recognition but I'm wearing a darn mask most of the time. I have already had a couple of glitches that required I restart my phone. Camera is awesome, sound is awesome for phone speakers. Is it worth the almost 1500? Absolutely no way!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I have always loved Samsung phones but this one is expensive and full of problems. It often completely freezes and sometimes it goes haywire, opening and closing apps randomly and on its own without me even touching it. I frequently have to shut it down and restart it. I thought it would take great pictures but my iPhone 8 pictures were better. Extremely disappointed in this phone. The screen cracked even after putting a protective coating on it and a replacement screen is 250 dollars. Don't buy this one."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I'm a big note guy but the latest note to me is not worth the money. They use a plastic case on the new note. Unless you really want the stylus I think the s20 and specifically the plus version will give you everything you need in a very premium phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Good product but wrong vendor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It's the most all-in-one phone that also has 15 hours battery life with moderate use. I use my phone all day because I've grown to depend on it. It's much more laptop like and productive than an iPhone. I'm sure I would love an iPhone but I'm not social and I depend on my phone for work and doing various jobs at once, also sideloading. My last phone was a note 3 and I did my best to compare its features like GPS and antennas and display quality between the two. I had hiccups with it but that's just because I have extremely high expectations for the price. Good news is you get a lot of freedom with how to make it work the way you want to and the updates are getting better. Do yourself a favor and get the plus not the ultra. The dual pixel camera is just better than the 108mp telescope."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It came really fast and has the charger and block and everything, that's awesome guys thank you!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased a galaxy s20+5g used from this seller, it showed up looking brand new, came mostly charged as well, after swapping the sim, I was good to go. +1 Reputation point, from a very satisfied customer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It was time for me to upgrade my phone and I finally decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20+. I've wanted one for a while and I'm really glad I made the decision to get this phone. I love everything about it. It is everything you want in a modern phone and it is just great quality. It was a great buy and I was provided with a lot of help from the seller. I had an issue and it was resolved in an orderly and appropriately fashion. They responder back to me fast and helped me solve my problem. I'm so thankful for the help from them. Now I have a new phone that I absolutely love and I don't regret buying it one bit. I most definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade to a newer phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great purchase. Fast delivery. Phone was in excellent condition. No issues. Excellent price. No complaints over here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love it left Google pixel and came back home to Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is an amazing achievement in modern technology. As in a refinement to a efficient and powerful moblie computer. In what I would assume its purest form to date. GOAT resolution and refresh rates. Overkill RAM and plenty of storage. Great feel and light in the hand. Smooth and quick operation. Camara is more than the average person would need. And I got it like 400 bucks off renewed (pretty much brand new). Idk what else you want me to say? You should buy this phone..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love my new phone, its really fast, battery life is awesome, the 5G speed is something else with cricket wireless, love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","So I bought this as a renewed premium and then when I did some test on it I realized that the battery capacity was under 80% and they probably said it to be over. The screen this large and for how much going on underneath there. This battery has got to be better than that because you're just charging it all day"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I am a big fan of the note phones, I bought the note 20 ultra, liked but Just out of the box when I stsrted setting it up I heard and felt something moving and ratling inside when you shake the phone, for and expensive electronic devise that is unacceptable, how did it pass quality inspection in Samsung factory, I am Galaxy S series fan, I know things like that happened but for the wait and times spent to get this phone this is dispointing to me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Loved the phone. Works well after 3 months with it. awesome camera, battery is ok. I upgraded from at note 10 plus and wanted a peen as well this one is awesome and such a big difference between those 2 phones. Would buy again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","This Amazon renewed is just as good as new, you can't tell the difference other than price. It doesn't come with charger or cable but that is a Samsung thing not Amazon. Don't bother buying from other sellers who claim renewed. This worth the extra $100 over those sellers."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Case fits well and is easy to hold. It's designed well to protect the phone. It's simple but boring."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","wow"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","3 stars for missing item. Everything else is in the box except for a USB connector which is supposed to be included :

Included Components

Handset, Data Cable, S-Pen, Ejection Pin, Quick Reference Manual, Terms & Conditions/Health & Safety Guide, Handset, Data Cable, Ejection Pin, USB Connector"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Good phone even though it's Samsung Certified refurbished it feels & looks brand new. I've had it about a month at the time of writing and the only issue I've had with it is it seems to hang when switching between multiple apps quickly or navigating at a pace the phone cannot keep up with.

I don't take pictures so no comment on that.

5G is still a lackluster promise of a service that LTE is demonstrably superior to on a day to day basis. So if your buying this phone for 5G, don't expect much; actually, expect your service to take a small but noticeable downgrade in connection speed. My LTE downloads are faster than 5G. Whoever is responsible for 5g implementation must still be working out the kinks. The tech is underwhelming at this stage.

That being said, i bought this phone because of the size and hardware. Both meet my expectations so Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

UPDATE 4-21-22:
So ive been having issues with bluetooth connectivity dropping out randomly while I watch or listen to anything while using the phone. Its still rare a.t.m. but when it happens, its fairly irritating. Im still very happy with this phone but thought i should update this review, FYI.

Update 4-24-22:
Hotspot no longer works. Bluetooth no longer works. I now understand why this POS was discontinued. Im pissed becasue i need this phone for work. Im now left with an ""ultra"" expensive paperweight. I'll try to RMA it under Samsung refurbished warranty but i wont hold my breath. I do not recommend anymore because this phone will break with regular use. Phone broke within 2 months. SMH what a waste of money.

UPDATE 6-28-22: I took a hammer and smashed this P.O.S. into pieces. I feel sooooo much better nowüòä"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","good touch screen perfect condition the whole phone very good condition, i tried everything before installing my data durability battery, charging the phone, so far everything works perfect that's ok"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I had an iPhone XR, it's WAY better than this trash. Android is garbage. You can't turn off notifications, so if I'm on top of a ladder fixing a roof I still get to hear about what the newest video game is.......if I fall I'm seeing.
Voice recognition does not work
Facial recognition barely works, barely, usually not.
Fingerprints barely work, I update them often and it still is trash.
I drive a lot so I need a phone to just work, no games, no nerdy crap where you must push a bunch of buttons.
I'm a grown man, I need a phone that works like a phone should. If I want something that always has to have my attention, makes stupid noises, doesn't know who I am, and you need a user manual thicker than the Bible.....I'd still be married"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Not a mark on it. No issues with Verizon switching over. So far, so good with the battery and performance seems fine."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","great product had it a month no problems"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","After a few days, the screen changed to this blank flickering green screen. I was unable to retrieve a normal screen, unable to get/make calls, unable to turn off or even do a hard reset. The phone is basically useless now. Thank God I didn't reset my old phone and trade it in or all my info would've been lost. Will never buy a refurbished or renewed phone again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","do not buy . The battery is damaged. It charges hard and loses charge quickly. It cannot be returned if there is damage. Zero zero zero. I lost my money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I love the samsung note phones. When you drop them, they are designed to launch the s-pen out of it like a friggen escape pod, so that you lose it and need to buy another 50 dollar stylus.

Not to mention the keyboard never registers the correct letters i type. And the fingerprint reader is absolute trash. 90% of the time i have to use my pin to unlock because the biometrics cant read the finger print ive had since i was born. Oh and sometimes it just drops connection to mobile data.

My next phone i wont be buying a Samsung product, they have become worse than Apple. Speaking of Apple, im so over Samsung watching every move Apple makes to see what they can get away with, but charging more for the phone every year."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","With most high-end phones surpassing the grand limit, it's easy to recommend this deal. As a renewed phone, it's technically not as new as when it first released, but you'd be fooled. The physical condition is flawless, and this still feels like a phone that could have come out today in 2022. The only major gripe I have with this phone ever since it was released was the fingerprint sensor reliability; Since the actual sensor is so small, there will be missed attempts here and there. But with being one of the last phones with SD Card support AND MST, it's a small price to pay for a fantastic phone. Camera still performs near best in class and performance is no different than the newer models."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","everything is in fantastic condition except the battery. I don't know if the battery is not new or if this phone originally last as it lasts with me.(battery)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","This phone is amazing. Super fast. Lot's of cool features in the camera and photo editor. The graphics are great and the infinity edges are a nice touch. Good battery life.
Bought magnetic case and one for my car. So easy to access my apps on Bluetooth.
Over all way cool."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I love it everything works perfectly ü•∞ üíû"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I purchased this Note 20 Ultra as an updated replacement for my Galaxy S9 Plus, which has been an excellent phone, but not 5G capable. So far, I have zero complaints about the Note 20 Ultra, but I do wish they would include a printed copy of the User Manual."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Been seeing several reviews that the phone is not the best. Obviously there is no prefect phone. So for this and considering its price. I would rate it five star. Its fast and the fingerprint is super fast as compared with my previous Samsung Note I had. The size is perfect not too big and not too small. And has almost all the features of a flagship apart from few not so important to me. Generally its nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this for my husband. The delivery was so fast and was right on time! The phone came as expected which was exciting. My husband broke his phone and was very discouraged due to all his clients contacts. But, set up was fairly easy and the phone is still doing the job after what we thought was going to be temporary. The one we got had some issues keeping the Sim card snagged but a overall its durable and works good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't had any issues that I couldn't find a fix for on the internet. The biggest thing was data not working, but I found out that it was an issue across all Samsung devices that can be fixed by toggling airplane mode on and off.

Battery life is decent. I haven't tried finger print or face recognition yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like the phone, it is fast and has a very sharp display, however, it lacks certain features which when buying a phone for this price, one would expect. Several lacking features include no eSIM support, no sd card memory expansion and no ability to set differing notification tone on an individual basis - all these were supported on my older (and less expensive) Samsung phone. If those missing features were included, I would rate it 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was easy to transfer my apps and photos. Seems to get signal better than my outdated LG. I thought about getting an iPhone but can't see putting that much money in technology that becomes outdated so quickly. I've had Apple and Android they both have their benefits. I chose the less expensive option this time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was a bit hesitant about buying a phone through Amazon but I'm so glad I did! Not only did Amazon have the best price but it did not disappoint. I also added on the protection plan at a good price. Battery life is good and that's with me using my phone all day for emails, social media, etc... If you're debating on buying a phone from Amazon this is your sign... buy the phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.

The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.

The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.

The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.

The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.

The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.

The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.

The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.

This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No battery charger included. Real bummer! New connections on the S21 require newer charging cables. Therefore, when my phone arrived with 6% battery could not prepare it for use. Wireless charging in my vehicle was too slow. Looking forward to using a fully charged phone. Amazon description should have included this caveat."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Edit: I'm a super heavy user. I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm. And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly. Love the phone. Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in florida

mark Edit: one month in, and I love it! Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.
I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them. Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.
Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected. Signal is great on tmobile. 5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off. but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.
Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors! Updates get sent all the time. So worth it!

And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens. For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance. S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9. The rest is pretty similar.
---
It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.

I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.

I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.

I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.

I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!

I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.

Please note, red it definitely an orangey red. I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.

I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.

Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full. The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow. The only things it didn't bring over were paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.

I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.
Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.

Happy happy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was a gift for my son and he loves it. The camera takes amazing pictures. Videos and games load fast. The sound is great quality for a phone. I'm very happy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my new phone. It'll take some time to get used to it. Im switching from an I-7 back to the Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is my second SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone. My first one had problems that two different experts could not solve, so I sent that one back to Amazon and got a replacement that works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Came as the description stated, unlocked. It was easy to set up, everything about this purchase was worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no complaints"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my mom, she is so happy with her phone, huge internal storage, amazing Camara, light, super fast to navigate in it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took awhile to transfer everything but works well once everything was transferred. Patience"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A wonderful product! I would recommend it to everyone. The photos clicked with it are superb. So are the videos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worked for the entire time. Took forever to break it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.

For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.

The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.

Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.

The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.

Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.

The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.

I apologize for the rant, lol.

Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.

You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.

This phone can also block Apple ID. These crazy females won't be calling me from different phone numbers anymore at 3am in the morning!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice being able to make payments and doesn't cost a fortune and is everything and more than I expected"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Read all the bad reviews. 2yrs later, knock on wood, phone still please wife.
Strong connectivity.
Fast for her useage.
Awesome photos, and good assortment of photo taking options like 2x optical zoom camera, slow motion video, etc...
Extra memory chip to store all those photos and videos. When its full, just but a new chip in.
Highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","However, the sim card tray had to be replaced. In the description for the open box option, it stated something along the lines of it's been handled, some signs of wear. Benign enough. However, the sim card tray was bent and that had to be replaced. NOT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION when the seller promoted the open box. All in all, the open box price was still a great option even with the additional $11 we had to spend on the new card tray. So far, the phone is performing well and suits my husbands needs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no issue so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This Samsung GS21FE 5G is the fastest and most detailed cell I've had...We like them a lot and the battery last about 10 hours of continued use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I never buy the latest thing. Too expensive.

But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal. I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.

Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.

It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier. Haven't really pushed the camera yet, but even after moving my pictures from my old phone, looking at those older pictures is better on this phone. A definite and noticeable upgrade.

Overall pleased with this phone. More pleased with the deal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","PROS
- runs fast and never freezes or crashes (have owned for 7 months)
- plenty of space and not overpowered by bloatwire as I though it might be (got 256 verison fyi)
- NFC works great and I've loved this feature (coming before from phones without it)
- customizable fonts, displays, screens
- great call quality, multi-tasking on phone between apps, and was easy to set up
- good size and weight
- camera is beautiful! I have taken some really great photos with this and gotten so many colors/details. Also love the features and the modes.
- 5G phone (happen to live in an area where I get some of this lol)

CONS
- battery at first (I had to switch to 60 hz display and now I get basically a full day/8-10 hrs)
- no headphone jack
- sometimes the pull out side draws are hard to pull out with touch
- adaptive brightness didn't work well/anytime I'm outside I have to turn it up quite a bit
- the photos and screenshots all save to the same place, so I have to sort through to get to my pictures sometimes and selectively import photos to google (serious hassle, but that's just how Samsung has it set up)

OTHER
- honestly, from the moment I bought it, I forgot how long I had it and had zero regrets after purchase. VERY HAPPY and will definitely buy another samsung (pending reviews) when I want to upgrade phones again . . . though I have a feeling this one will last a while.
- Would definitely still recommend this phone! :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery goes down quickly, Phone is charged in the morning 100% by the time i get to work for 8:30 it's down to 52% just listening to music, my older phone holds charged way longer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased a Samsung S21 to replace my Samsung S10 Lite that the screen cracked on and was starting to have a few technical glitches. After using the new S21 for a few days I can almost live with my old glitches and cracked screen. For a brand new phone this battery drains QUICKLY. I am already going to be ordering another fast charging port so that I can get through the day at work AND the evening before charging it fully at night. Another feature that isn't working is the face recognition. That isn't a deal breaker for me since I am content using the fingerprint option, but something I've noticed just the same and wanted to mention in case you relied on it.
I have had LOTS of Samsung phones and am always happy with them, but this one misses the mark a bit for me mainly due to battery life. Since purchasing I have done a few tweaks that were mentioned like going to dark mode and restarting more to make sure I am rebooting once in awhile (which is something I rarely had to do on my S10). I am hoping that makes a difference."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just received this phone and was disappointed to discover there is no charging block. It comes with a USB C to USB C male to male cable. All of my charging blocks accept a standard USB A cable so I have no way to charge it without purchase a new one. I have had difficulties in the past finding USB chargers manufactured by Samsung and I would like one with the correct specifications for my phone.
The description page does have a section that says ""What's in the box?"", however it only says TBD. Guess I learned my lesson on that.

Also I was not notified of delivery like I am with nearly every delivery so this phone sat out on my front porch for nearly 24 hours before I noticed. Thankfully it did not get stolen but it was sitting out in wet weather.

I have yet to activate or use the phone, since I cannot charge it but may change my rating once I find an appropriate charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone charger not supplied with phone. Seems odd not to include an essential piece of equipment for the function of phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed a new phone. First, I bought the Galaxy S22+. It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly. Plus, the outrageous price. So, I returned it. Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory. Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day I love this phone. Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back. But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day. And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe. Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me. And it was half the price of the S22+. This is a great alternative to the S22 series."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My Zenfone 6 died on me. Out of all the phones, this was the only one to offer most of the features the Zenfone 6 did.

I needed a good battery, finger print scanner, expandable memory, snapdragon 8xx, 4k @60 video recording. This was the only one to offer these features.

The only two features I was worried about were the battery life and finger print scanner.

The battery life is great. Can easily get a day with moderate use and low screen brightness.

I was skeptical about the onscreen finger scanner. I couldn't verify beforehand if I needed to turn on the screen to use the scanner. Thankfully the scanner can be activated with the screen off. It's very accurate and fast.

The phone runs smooth. The cell signal is good. I use T-Mobile, and can get signal in most places.

The only thing I still don't like about all Samsung phones is their custom UI. Will never prefer it over stock Android.

Overall the phone is a great. Even now in mid 2022 there is no other better replacement for my Zenfone 6.

I recommend the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone over a month ago to up grade from a S8. I live in Cape Coral Fl an as you know we just got hit by Ian which totally destroyed everything. This phone has been a god send. Got multiple calls in the eye of the storm and post storm. Id say sure its partially my carrier which is Metro PCS but I think it was also the phone or just a miracle. BUT I NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH MY FAMILY ONCE! thank you for making such a wonderful product."

After running the diagnosis, the local service center told me it was because the sim was not connecting to the network, which could be either due to faulty sim card, carrier software, or issue within the phone itself. I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.

---------
Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released. It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls. (Also can't return it, because I thought a software update would fix the problem and has been waiting and waiting, and 30 days has passed, issue still there)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours, I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily. I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing. The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitely get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this White FE 25th March 2022 but started using some time in May and it took 3 months of using to realize that it is ACTUALLY DUAL SIM!!! All along I thought that the sim tray having SIM1 and SIM2 on the flip side was a generic design. It is odd because nothing on Amazon says dual sim but now checking GSM arena, it does indeed say dual sim stand-by.

The only draw back for me is the caller ID. It only shows the contact is the number is stored EXACTLY as it shows if the contact calls you! Very frustrating seeing contacts numbers I have stored display as a plain NOT saved first time caller."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works well. It is a unlocked phone. My sim is not American based and I had no problems. GSM is one of the networks that is used, which the phone supports."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update 7/20/22

I am still satisfied with my phone, in fact I have grown fonder of it. After using it for a few months I like its battery life better as it lasts me through the day.

The phone is highly customizable thru the ""Good Lock"" app.

The volume on the speakerphone has been useful a few times when I have taken while riding my bike with the phone on an armband.

I still highly recommend this phone, specially when there's a sale or refurbished one available. More bang for the buck!

-------

I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is fast and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].

The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.

The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.

I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.

To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.

The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)

I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions. I normally keep my phones until they give the ghost."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my new phone and the colors they come in are beautiful. I haven't used the face recognition yet but the finger print reader works pretty well, maybe a few times were it didn't work. Battery life has been getting me thru a day of work and then some as well, so good Battery life in my opinion. Love this phone definitely recommendüëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had this phone for 18 months, its been dropped and never broke, battery still lasts all day and some when i watch alot of videos and games, cameras are great, size is perfect. Best phone for the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is an upgrade from my $300 Motorola g6 that worked well for 3+ years but lacked the quality camera and some other features and was starting to become noticeably slower.

In upgrading my 3 highest priorities were hearing aid support, a better camera and faster processor for a price under $500.

I also considered the Pixel phones but chose this one for the cameras and price. All the better phones I looked at could stream directly to my Oticon More I hearing aids.

The face ID works as well as I expected as long as there is sufficient light. Why the phone doesn't produce more light when it needs it is a curiosity to me.

Like other phones I've had the fingerprint reader seems to require me to change how I apply my finger to the reader as time goes by.

The battery life is good and I only need to charge during the day if I am doing g a lot of Bluetooth broadcasting to my hearing aids.

Thy biggest annoyance at this point is I usually have to re-pair my hearing aids at least once a day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone far exceeded my expectations. The Android Play is great. I can play Pandora and Waze on my car stereo from this phone. I don't use the finger print or face recognition part but the battery lasts all day with plenty left over and i'm on it a lot..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lots of storage very high tech"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.
Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).
This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.
Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.

That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.

In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.

I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is probably my fifth android from Samsung since switching from Blackberry. I formerly traveled a great deal and needed to be in contact. I was an early adapter but not a nerd. I choose Samsung over other manufacturers and have been very satisfied. iphone users always seem ready to put the Android down but I find the Samsung a much better price point. Each one seems to get a little better. Especially the camera optics. No exception with this one. My wife is now using my previous A50 model and is very satisfied. Previously all the Samsungs were the S series. I have never cracked a screen that I recall and that makes me believe they are sturdy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my Galaxy S phone. It reminds me of my galaxy s9 I loved and missed so much."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I replaced my S10 with this phone. No regrets! Display is vibrant and cameras are awesome. I use the phone to stream online. The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped. That is the only shortfall."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This a good phone with a good camera, battery life isn't the best. Notice it does not have a memory slot. You will only get the cable (C to C) and adapter is not included. Some cables (USB to C) do not work properly so I ended up buying the Samsung adapter C to C. Android Auto DOES NOT WORK on this phone, I had to buy an adapter for the car (usb to C) cables used with other phones didn't work. Adapter didn't recognize the Android Auto app either (I bought Samsung original cables), I have done everything but it just don't work on this phone. I have read that all Samsung S21 have reported the same issue. This is frustrating, Android Auto works fine with Pixel 6 and Xiaomi, so I'm considering changing the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great features in this phone, especially for the price. There's always a catch, though, and in this case it's battery life. I upgraded from an older Samsung Android wanting 5G and better battery life. I got one of those. This one is slightly better than my 3 year phone related to battery life, but it's way more powerful. Can't have your cake and eat it too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had an 8s. This phone is about the same size and works basically the same. I have 2 complaints: it keeps showing pop ups, like multi media formating for at least a whole minute which prevents me from reading the text I received; difficult to assign individual notification sounds for each app (ie, I wanted a knocking sound for text messages only, but no matter what I do it knocks for other apps as well)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the battery on this new phone. 10x better than my last."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been using this for quite awhile now and have had 0 problems. Everything is as described and working as intended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is wonderful. Battery life is long, screen looks new and everything works as it should. Lots of storage, downloads fast and pictures turn out beautiful. Would buy again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Used for one week. Dropped on counter tops and busted screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice. Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards. Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable. The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use. But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip. The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast. Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video. I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone. There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google. I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.

Setup was a breeze. I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that! I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The price was good for a damn good phone. I went with the S20 because it is the last to offer the mini SD card slot. Easy transfer of pictures and music. I had a S9 previously. This S20 is crazy fast, and the battery life is better than expected. All day and more.
Good price (half of the brand new S22) on the fence? Get off the fence and order it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone arrived without an adapter"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works fine. The battery, however, runs down quickly -even when I'm not using it. It was fully charged this morning and as it sat on my desk, unused, the battery dropped to 68%. As I write this, it dropped down to 66%. I'm not sure what goes into refurbishing a phone and whether they put in a new battery, so either this model sucks battery life or this is the old battery from the original phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I don't use gave recognition. And my fingerprints are mostly burned away, so not using that either. Already mentioned battery life is questionable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ended up working ok. The phone we have is pretty but the case is ugly.
It does offer good protection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9 for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.

The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.

For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.

I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!

Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.

When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off, the battery is just OK, out of the box. With power saving settings I usually go 2 full days before charging. That's with a lot of bluetooth/earbud and internet usage. Satisfied with the battery.

Phone has some settings such as capping your CPU output at 70% which uses less battery life, as well as display and app settings you can modify for further battery saving. The phone is great in general. Very satisfied overall and would easily recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it's battery life and overall performance. Easy to use and great pictures!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G was an upgrade from an older Samsung. Perhaps, I expected improved battery life which is really something Samsung should work on. With minimal usage, I get about two days of life. The facial recognition works occasionally, but the fingerprint works fine, so no real problem. Everything else is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice phone at a great deal on Prime Day. Been ready to upgrade to 5G for a while but didn't like the retail price. This model gives me the features I wanted in a size similar to the S9+ I currently use. Gave it 4 stars because Samsung ditched the micro SD slot which I liked because I don't like using the cloud for data or pics.
Your results and opinion may vary;)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got to be honest I am not using the finger print feature since my hands are messed up, and didn't do the face recognition since I always wear a mask, but the phone is fine. It has a lot more storage than my other phone and the layout is perfect for me. Pictures and videos come out great as well. However, the battery on this is not great. Do not expect this phone to last for over a day evsn if you're just watching YouTube on it. If you need a phone to hold a charge for a long time I might not get this unless you got things to charge your phone with on stand by."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was a replacement for my.first S20 fe. I was a.little reckless and had the screen cover and case off and dropped it about 4 feet onto some cement. This phone has so many features and memory and is lightning fast! Battery
life could be better"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great graphics and good upgrade from my old S6. The battery is seriously the worst. This could have been a 5 star rating. I go from 100% to 85% within an hour. Disappointing, but it was Amazon Prime Day, so I got a good deal. I'll just have to keep it charged as often as I can. I'll definitely do more research before I upgrade again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I thought having an expensive Samsung would be incredible but if we talk about how durable is the charge of the battery is way worse than cheaper Samsungs. Also, it overheat most of the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought. I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus. That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues. I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone. Its screen is vibrant and colorful. Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning. I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well. Some complain about the selfie camera. At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled. Everything here far surpasses all my expectations. Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent. This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner. With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it. I never got half a day with my Motorola. I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage. This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time. Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it. Highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","just love the battery life. have not used the facial recognition. camera's are great too!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am a little disappointed on the battery life for this phone. It lasts most of the day, but does not have the life that I expected on this quality of phone. That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars. Otherwise, I am very happy with this phone. Definite upgrade over my previous Galaxy S10e."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone except camera is blurry when taking pictures of moving objects. My LG Stylo 4 took better pictures.. Sucks when you're trying to capture memories."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.

I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.

The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!

The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I checked in the Q&A section to make sure it came with a charger since the ""what's in the box"" just says TBA. People said it did but mine did not. Inconvenient and annoying. I am still mainly using my old phone (galaxy s8) until my case and screen protector arrive for this one and only have the 1 charger. No headphone jack, no dongle, no charger. They should at least supply you with what you need for general use.
Anyway I will probably update this to be more about the phone as I get some use out of it. So far impressions are that the battery is nothing to call home about even though it's a step up from my current one that drains in a few short hours of screen time. Which this new phone definitely lasts longer than that. Just not quite the amazing lasting quality I had noticed when I bought the s8. Absolutely runs smoother but gets equally hot as it's charging or in use. Definitely better camera than the s8. If it had the charger the rating would be at least a 4 star."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My only issue is us old schoolers like to get in box instructions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't used the facial or finger print security features so I can't comment on n those features. What I don't like at all is the amount of advertisements on this phone - it's annoying and not what I want at all but I refuse to pay a monthly fee to disable the ads. Won't buy another Samsung unless they ditch that feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.
Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.
For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!
However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.
1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)
2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first time ever purchasing a phone on Amazon. I was able to easily take this phone to Verizon and have them activate it. I've had the phone for almost a year now, and the only notable degradation I've observed is the battery life. I'm sure this happens inevitably with most phones, but it's still no slouch. I wanted the best bang for my buck on a good black Friday deal on my phone, and I definitely got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the item but the charger and charge cable were not included."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I feel like this product heats up. The screen feels super hot at times and sometimes I lose signal ,apps say network offline so I have to restart it to get it to work again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No it did not , it was advertised as a dual sim phone but operates as a
single sim phone as the phone can only recognize one sim in the slot that
was made to hold two , there is no sim card manager option in the settings
,other than that, it is a very good phone with excellent performance and
features, I have to now find cash to source another phone to house my
other sim card ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...

I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you want a solid phone with an SD card this is a great option. If you want to install titanium backup you are out of luck. There is currently no method for unlocking the boot loader for Android 12 -- One UI 4.0 -- so ... NO ROOT FOR YOU!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my phone - had a Samsung 7 forever (I don't like change). It was so easy to transition to S21 - has all of the former features I loved so much and so many more. No learning curve at all to use it and lots more functionality. Really great sound quality - for calls, music and media. I will probably hold on to this one for the next 7 years. :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really super nice phone. The camera quality is simply outstanding and the screen is fantastic too. It's fast enough even in the 6GB ram version. Battery life could be a bit better but power-saving mode does help without detracting from the experience. I wish they'd throw in a dual charging and headphone dongle though. Miss my headphone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The description was not clear. I checked immediately i realised i had purchased an used phone. My fault is that i thought i was getting a new A series. Upon receipt i see its a S series and used. Came fast. Box was old. I just don't want a used phone. Nothing is wrong with it. Why i gave three stars i because thr description should be very clear its a used phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off this phone is not from manufacturer. I tried to get accident insurance from Samsung and when I enter the EMEI. It tells me that they don't insure phones from other country's. And 2nd it did not come with an S-Pen. This phone does have some issues although it's 6 ram and 256 mg it's slow . Pictures aren't good. I did have the note 10 plus before this phone and I would say it's like night and day no comparison. Never any issues with my note 10 plus."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery went through 3 days without power during hurricane Ian."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Transferred all files easily from old to new. Easy to get accustomed to especially if you currently have a samsung or android. SD card slot is with sim card slot - easy to install. No fear of breaking a thousand dollar plus phone;-)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was supposed to be a factory unlocked US version. I am not sure it is? Having network issues. The phone is great though and I hope I can keep it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is ""just ok""! I had to have it replaced by Samsung after the return period ended as the wifi receiver crapped out and the phone couldn't maintain a connection. Amazon would do NOTHING, and Samsung took my NEW phone back and repaired it but I had NO PHONE for a full week!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Phone is amazing, I have had this for a while now and I'm loving it soo much, Quality is Amazing, Performance is Amazing as well as Battery is Long lasting, I love the phone soo much I would buy another one if I could lol, I definitely recommend this phone to any persons looking for a Cheaper High-Quality phone :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely better than my old A50! I am disappointed with the battery life. Also it updates so frequently."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the least expensive place I found this phone. Although Cricket offered it on their website, for some reason every payment type I tried (3) was rejected and the order cancelled. The local stores couldn't get it, and didn't know when it would be available. They suggested Best Buy or Samsung.com, but both of those were $150 more. Amazon to the rescue!! In stock AND it was PRIME DAY!! I got it for less than I could anywhere else! Love the phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall, I like the phone. It's fast, stable, and feature packed. I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me). I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.

If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone. Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case). This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass. While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.

Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Returned. Bought it thinking that it would surpass the 500 dollar TCL I bought in March. That phone is now 340.00 which is closer to the correct price. Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet. I really don't need a great camera with a million pixels and 4 different lenses. I have a dslr for photos. Will run this TCL in the ground for the next year."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone a year ago. The camera on this phone is really great. Clear, sharp pictures. I do like the features of the phone. After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easy to use good battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything about this phone. Great value for the money."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Basically this is an updated S10e but with a bigger battery, better processor and larger screen. I'm very happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received the S20 FE today. Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot. Overall its been a good first day with the phone.

I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.

Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing. Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.

Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display. I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.

My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM. That was a selling point for me. When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am not having any problems with this 20 fe g5 phone. It works good. Put the att SIM in and was receiving texts and making calls without issue. I like the no wire charging, the easy backup of contacts and apps. it was very nice to have the SIM card removal stick in the box.
It was also easy to put the micro memory in on the other side of the service providers SIM, SIM on one side flip little tray over and memory goes there, I watched a YouTube video on where memory went. I know people need to lock their phones but I don't like to and I like that it allow that as an opt out. Mostly I hate Bixby and although Bixby still takes up space it isn't a button on the phone. Bixby is the worst thing about Samsung phones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I wanted to go back to a Samsung Galaxy phone. I had a iPhone that gave me a lot of trouble. I was so happy to get the Samsung Galaxy S20F phone on sale and it an excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.
I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!
I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.
Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have only had this phone a short period of time, but I am really happy with it. I use straight talk and I was able to active this phone after I purchased a straight talk SIM card (only .99 cents!)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a long time, I had a Samsung A31 which worked really good until I realized that my time for updates was running out and I wanted android 13 and up. So I did research and bought this phone, works with straight talk well. Definitely recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had an old S8 that was cracked to heel due to my 2 year old. Everything is SO much quicker now. Pop back and forth between apps instantly. My Twitter and reddit feeds scroll so smoothly, and the 5g is faster than my fiber connection at home. It's a little too big for my liking, but I'll get used to it. I like the button layout on my S8 better, but I'll get used to that as well. The finger print reader for me is instant and perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Edit/update-Had to return this.

Reception was terrible but improved slightly after disabling the 5g radio. The Xperia I replaced this with has not had this issue or any of the following ones

This phone did not like wifi6, only 2.4ghz played nicely

This thing did not emby at all. Video was all black blocks that kinda faded out wherever the movement was but very odd looking. It would also take a very long to load anything and often had a/v sync issues. My current phone does not have this issue nor did the v35, z4 play. Or essential phone I used over the last 2 years.

The camera really does overprocess images but most people might be good with it.

Forget about unlocking the bootloader. It'll work for the enxyos version but nothing yet with the snapdragons.

It feels like everythingfrom Samsung requires another agreement even a camera mode. The amount of bloatware is crazy too.

""TouchWiz"" needs to go away

I would strongly recommend looking at other phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery doesn't last long.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The face recognition and the fingerpint is okay. Sometimes the fingerprint can't recognice your finger, but I think it is fine. However, the battery life is a main problem for me. The battery life really drains down a lot when I am on this phone. The previous phone I have will last the whole day, but this samsung phone will only last me three hours. I also have a problem with using the camera for this phone. At first everything was great, but after a while, when I open my phone, it will vibrate for no reason. I have tried to find the cause but there is nothing. Also when i use the camera it will lag and log me in to other apps. When i use snapchat, it will keep on vibrating nonstop. Don't get this please! It is not worth 500$!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it's a great phone with good camera and battery life. and you don't have to wait for always on display until ip14 comes out"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When my old Samsung S9 stopped working without warning ( network ) I started looking for a phone. With the supply shortages around the world this was not as easy as it should have been. I checked retailers and service providers. It seemed that they only had black phones available if any. Did not want a black phone. I also could not afford the latest, best models. The S21 had all the latest software and features with a beautiful display. Data transfer from my old phone was very easy. New phone is fast. Of all the features that I was concerned about was the speaker. As a senior with less than perfect hearing I was very pleased with the volume. I could hear the phone clearly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After two months use the only problem I have is the lack of a slot for expandable memory. The video is clean and crisp and the speaker is good enough that I can hear it even with my bad hearing. The camera works well and takes nice photos. Would I buy it again? No because by the time I need a new phone this will be obsolete."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.

FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.

Pros
- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.
- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.
- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.
- Camera is amazing. 3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.
- I love the colors. I got the Orange.
- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.
- Larger screen and battery than the S20
- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner
- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.
- Comes with a charger. APPLE!

Cons
- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.
- No 3mm headphone jack
- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.

In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.

Auto focus:
The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.
A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.
This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.
The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focus

Finger Print Sensor:
It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.
Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.
Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.

Using the Camera kills other apps:
I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.

Note: Moved to this phone from the S9"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","an upgrade from my faithful S10e. A bit bigger but no so much heavier.
works fast, good camera and great screen. I think the battery life could be improved, is not as long lasting as I expected.
But great features for a good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Used daily for everything a cell phone is supposed to do, but this one feels and acts like it won't have the durability of a Galaxy. So spend the extra money and get the better version. You'll thank me later."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is exactly what I was looking for. The S22 has not great reviews so I defaulted to this for my son & he loves it. It's bigger than regular size phone, came in factory sealed box brand new with everything we needed. Battery lasts all day, fingerprint reader without issue. Reliable & sturdy, hope it lasts as long as his last phone (S10e)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G it's a great device so far I got the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM and by comparing it to my current S20 FE side by side with the S21 FE the S21 FE is a little shorter and the S20 FE is a little taller but the one thing I don't like about the S21 FE is the back plastic when touching it with your finger it feel like one of those plastic tray that you get from the fast food restaurant and if you are planning to buy the S21 FE don't forget to purchase a skin wrap from sopiguard or dbrand and you might want to put a case on but I'm going to give the S21 FE 5 Star anyway it's a premium device with cheaper plastic back cover like a fast food to go plastic tray so far it's a really great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The S21FE delivers the speed I need and reliability I love. The only problem I ran into was the texting app. It was not working with most texting applications. I did not want to hard restart the phone and do a factory reset. I had just set up everything. I searched and found textra working beautifully, so I will just paid for that texting app‚Äîno other issues. I'm happy with the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.

I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked. My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully. I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.

But I'm amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem. I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.

Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps. I don't want bloatware, but as I became familiar with Samsung apps they work flawlessly with their products.

The other thing is the camera on this Samsung is outstanding and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Samsung has hooked me.

The phone also works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy watches.

Excellent customer service and support."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I already own one but brother wanted to purchase S21FE but discovered S21FE did not include removable SD card so returned phone and purchased this one. It was brand new in sealed box AND included both charger and cable, which Samsung not leaves out for $600-$1000 you would think they can spare a couple bucks for charger and cable. Phone activated fine with Verizon and everything seems great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because I needed to. My old phone had a cracked screen and it had started to glitch. So I choose this one.
This phone is exactly as described. Battery is ok; won't last more than a day. I don't use my phone for many things so it's a good option for my everyday life."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love everything about this phone (128 gb, 6gb ram, Snapdragon chip version) It's looks, specs, camera, call quality, performance, all the usual stuff. At $499 it's a bargain at the price point simply because of the Oct 2020 release date.

One issue for me is I use it for personal and work. I think this causes a Play Store App install issue (not sure if it's Android or Samsung bug). At first it seems unfixable. But in my case removing the Sim card and SD card ND then a reboot fixed it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about the device is as you would expect (pretty great) except for one thing...it's bent.
Not a big bend mind you, but a very very slight one that even the technician I ended up bringing it to did not see it at first. One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.
Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love this camera, I upgraded from an S5, quite a change. So far, the only dislike is the size of my photos. My photos are around 7 meg, humongous! I am burning up a lot of space on my storage devices.
Its nice to have that quality when needed, but not for everyday photos. It is a pain to change the resolution of each photo after the shot. I am looking to see if maybe there is a better camera app to allow this setting, this is my first camera to not have this setting. I hope enough people complain so Samsung will return this feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone to replace my one plus 7t phone that did not have WiFi calling.It lives up to Samsung quality and performance."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone arrived in pristine condition. Setup was extremely simple -- I simply removed the SIM card from the older broken phone and placed the card in the new phone. After about 10-15 minutes of configuration / downloading updates, I had a working phone that was much faster and more advanced than my older broken phone.

The one downside is that I did a speed test on Verizon's 5G network and noticed speeds were no where near where they claimed 5G would be at this point. However, this is a carrier issue and not a phone issue so I didn't knock the review based on something outside the control of the seller.

All in all, a great transaction and one that I wouldn't hesitate to do again in the future!

- J"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had to buy a new phone. Went from s10 to this. Hate the removal of headphone jack but what can you do. Color looks more blue than mint green but that might just be me. Either way it's in a case so I don't really care. Came new in box and works perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Transferred over about 2 weeks ago and I was excited to have this much storage vs what I previously had. I always keep my screen dimmed when using and turn off all apps from running in the background but literally watched the battery drain from 93% to 61% in about 2 minutes! It's super disappointing for the amount of money spent on it, especially when I found the same model and make elsewhere for $100 less, only 2 days after it arrived."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In 2022 it's very difficult to buy a new phone with microSD support. I bought this S20 FE to replace my S9+. It was easy to transfer all my apps and data to the new phone.

Unfortunately Samsung deliberately limits the performance of external SD cards to encourage people to buy phones with larger internal storage. My SDXC card can do 91MB/s read and 59MB/s write on my laptop's card reader, but only 74MB/s read and 38MB/s write on S20 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good budget phone. It has all the up to date specs as most other phones do. The face and finger print reader work well. It works with most 5G networks. No lag or battery drainage for a new phone. Camera has a lot of options. Only complaint is, after a I bought the phone the price went down almost $50 30 days later. Of course, after the return date. I really hate when Amazon does that. Other then that, it works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Has a great camera. Very clear screen. Battery life excellent. Glad we bought it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery lasts long time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's an average phone. Nothing like a flagship, battery üîã life is terrible and the phone gets hot often.
It has smooth scrolling and decent storage. The camera is average. Not good at all, my a51 5g took better pics and had much better charging and battery life.
S20 fe is a better phone and I truly regret spending money on this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was delivered on time, took it to Tmobile setup took 5 minutes. Very happy with this purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.

The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.

This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.

Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.

One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good replacement for my old s8 plus.

Had it about 10 months now and phone is still ok. But it is a little glitchy. The screen will either not want to scroll, or will jump around or select things without me even touching the screen. Doesn't do it a lot but shouldn't do it at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am on a prepaid plan with Verizon. Had no problem with service. Phone came with Smart Switch. I am not super tech smart but even I could follow the simple directions which transferred everything to the new phone. Text messages ,photos ,contacts and apps. Beautiful phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good phone except for bixby"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well, but your first month will be spent on the internet trying to find hidden setup options."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything about this phone. After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to buy the phone. But after some thought I purchased it and haven't had a problem with it at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.

Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone. I would highly recommend this phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this because I didn't want the giant Samsung Galaxy S21 ultra super mega or whatever it's called. DOES NOT HAVE AN SD CARD SLOT. You will need to free up 84 hours of your life to transfer everything over to your new phone, wirelessly. One. File. At. A. Time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took a picture of my puppy and as you can see, it takes good photos. I upgraded from a Samsung galaxy s7 so it's a major upgrade for me. I'm a 66 year old woman and it was easy to move all my stuff from my old phone to the new one. So far I love this phone and the battery lasts all day into the evening. Very happy üòä"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really like this phone. Upgraded from the Samsung A50. The S 21FE 5 G is just a hair bigger, but is actually lighter and packs a whole lot of features into its size. Got the model with the 128 MB and it works amazing. The camera is great, sharp and clear and battery life is easily all day even using it a lot. It has facial recognition and a finger print reader which is much better than the A 50. The only down side it will not run an app that we specifically got the phones for, the DEXCOM 6G app to read blood sugars. I think the app hasn't been updated for the newest phones.
Over all very pleased with the phones and the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Great service. Great seller. Arrived in the original box. New and factory sealed. Love the phone and Samsung. Big improvement over my old S7. Tried others and this is the one for me. Don't hesitate to buy one. The price and features are just right."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back.
The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly.
Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).
Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)
For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.
Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the s21fe g5 and liked it so much, I ordered a second one for my wife. WARNING: My wife clicked on the green option so our phone would be different. What I didn't know, when she changed color, Amazon switched the phone to a s20 fe. I returned the S20 fe and reordered s21 fe it in graphite"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your a someone who uses your phone all day and hate charging your your phone,i dont recommend buying it. I bought this phone brand new and the battery life is really bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed an upgrade and I have never spent more than $200 on a phone before. Thought I would treat myself. Jokes on me. Battery life sucks and this brand new, unlocked phone is in a constant loop of updates and reboot. Never again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was alarmed when I got this phone because the included cable plugged into the phone at both ends of the cord. Two small plug-ins. I don't have any adapters that would fit that it make this work as a usb connection. What I realized later is that my old Samsung charging cord works with it, and that has a usb adaptor that can work in my car. The included cable is actually supposed to be used to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone!! How about that? I didn't use that, but used the QR code the new phone gave me and the bluetooth connection and easily transferred all my data, even before I have gotten a sim card for it. Bravo, Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works great! First time with an S phone and I am not disappointed by any means. I was also able to transfer my number and services without much issue.

Very happy, would recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.
There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.
I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.

My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.

A little common sense would be great.
It's an expensive electronic device. This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.

I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.

GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.
There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.

I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is great! Needed a new phone and the carriers make it imposable to change. I guess that the phone number is what they want. Buy the phone and get your provider and save money."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for loyal Samsung Galaxy users but other flagship phones around the same price range have better features. I owned an S8 for years and noticed this phone did not improve battery life as much as it should after 4 generations. But still great overall phone for standard users like me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was finally time to move up from my Galaxy S7, Lol...it still worked pretty good, but was so slow. Bought my new S21 on Prime Day and got a great deal! So far, very happy with the phone. Larger screen, good battery life and super fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fingerprint scanner works, but only when I get my thumb just right, and it wasn't picking up any better in the training session. Methods to open menus or swipe away windows tend to overlap in applications and for the phone notifications...etc. resulting in a lot of wrong windows opened or swiped away."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my new Samsung galaxy s21 bc I'm a simple man. I have simple needs and also bc I had my s9 plus for like 3 and half years. Great upgrade for the price couldn't find a better price anywhere just make sure you know who your carrier is and have a current Sim card to switch it over. Battery life is great authenticity is perfect. If you're an android person get this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works perfect for a 3rd party phone. SO FAR. I've only had the phone for a month."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hubby needed a new phone since he put his in washing machine. Came out very clean but didn‚Äôt work. Purchased this one had a few bumps but he likes it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What bothers me the most is that the cord sent was not the one for this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I can't downplay the reviews from other users because their opinions and needs are different than mine. I almost did not purchase because of certain reviews but I'm glad I did because so far this phone has been amazing. I came from a Moto G5s plus and I can see a big difference already, in a good way. There are a few features I will have to get used to, but I can adapt. The only downside so far is only having 3 fingerprints to use to unlock your phone, but that's minor. I definitely recommend. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone and it came right on time. It is so easy to use and I don't have to fight with the screen like my last phone to type and correct things. It takes amazing pics and the battery is very good. I have nothing bad to say about it. Loving the sage green too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is great and I had no problems with it. However, for some reason it's not on Samsungs trade in list. So if you want to upgrade, u may want to steer clear of buying this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far. So easy to set up and transfer all my info from my S9 and did it all wirelessly. Paired up everything for Bluetooth as well. Not glitchy and colors on screen are so clear and bright. The price was definitely right and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. All of the reviewers' complaints about facial recognition and fingerprint access do not apply to me, because I do not use them. The transition from my old Motorola phone and my S21 FE I did myself with only a few problems. The screen is sharp, the size is comfortable and my applications run smoothly. The only app I have had trouble with is the Contacts app (Samsung), which will not let me edit Contacts. This problem is endemic in the S20s and S21s. I downloaded a Google app for contacts and had no more trouble."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always been a Samsung guy, but my last phone was a MOTO Z3 Play. It was nice, but weak camera and battery was getting bad at 30 months, phone also acting buggy even after factory reset... This S20 FE blows the MOTO away. It really is the perfect screen size! Not too big! WOW the 5G is incredible!!!!!! Camera is great and I'm demanding... 120Hz is just the best, do not downplay this, it's smooth as butter.... love the screen print scanner, it's flawless no matter what people say, just keep re-entering same thumb as finger one, two and three, it reall is flawlewss if you do that... AMOLED screen is just BEAUTIFUL! Gorrilla Galss 3 is a must... battery life is great, I'm on it a lot and still 40-50% by end of day... supplied charger is plenty fast enough... menu is bloated and complicated, but manageable... LOVE the stereo speakers! Just an all around great experience... no need to get the S20. Great price here... sold by and shipped by Amazon, what more do you want??"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This size is perfect. Fast processing. On screen finger print recognition great. I miss not having an led showing battery charger status and flashing led when I missed a call. Screen shots are no longer power & vol buttons but swiped palm across screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's OK, nothing revolutionary"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from a pixel 2 I expected more.
Front camera is slow and very blurry in low-light
vibration intensity is pathetic, I keep missing calls.
it's obnoxiously large
fingerprint scanner is inconsistent at best, even without any screen protection (if anyone had one in stock)
Samsung's version of android is garbage, I actually downgraded from Android 11 to 10

battery life is better than my ancient phone.
wifi6 is fast, about 300Mbps tested
Wifi6 Stats:
Channel 40 (11ax)
Signal 94% (-53 dBm)
Rx Rate 960 Mbps
Tx Rate 648 Mbps
Power Save Enabled

5G is decent (LTE+ indicated at 100Mbps down, 4Mbps up, AT&T in Raleigh, NC)

If you you like Samsung's spin on android and large screens this is a great phone for you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size, high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware, Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.

This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I'm very happy with mine and I think you will be too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera on this phone is phenomenal it will go to 30x zoom but it is only clear up to 25x, which is still way more than i'll ever need. Overall the phone is really nice, long battery life and far more storage than i'll ever need."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good 5G phone for the price. Heavier than expected...got a Otter cover and screen protector. Camera didn't work at first but Amazon Customer Service helped get it working."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great no problems does what it says. Battery drains faster then expected"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm completely satisfied.
Unlocked version worked great.
Very fast phone !
But one thing I thought it was supposed to come with a sim card/cards mine came with none"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung took away SD card slot. So no memory expansion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After some research, I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I've learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The two reviews below are from the first two times I attempted to purchase and use this phone. Third time was the charm. The Bluetooth works fine, and I'm loving this phone!

----------------

The phone is very attractive, the sound quality is good, and the screen is large and the picture clear. But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)

I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer. But really, at these prices, should I have to do research to make it do something it's supposed to do anyway? I really wanted to love this phone, but it is useless to me unless the Bluetooth works with my car."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life of the phone I got is terrible! I'm going to have to have a new battery put in it already! Never had this issue with any other phone until this one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took like a day getting use to the finger print being at the front of the screen rather than the back of the phone(old phone). Nothing wrong with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is unlocked but some services will have problems adding it and will insist it's already been attached to a carrier. Fingerprint reader isn't great with glass screen protector and for some reason all glass screen protectors come with a hole for the front facing camera so fuzz builds up making the image quality poor.

I have no qualms with the phone itself though. Works great, it's fast. Restarts amazingly fast. Great photo quality even with the fe version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall happy with the phone. Few little quirks, camera wants to go to portrait mode instead of landscape when trying to deposit checks. Battery is good, not great.
For the price it's a solid choice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quality phone for the price. Only downfall is there is no slot for additional memory."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was my first time buying a phone online but I took the chance and am happy I did. Phone works perfectly, setup was easy and the package, phone and accessories was in good condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cost saving (or false claim of earth saving) measures means no charger in the box with the phone. The old Samsung charger I had is not a fast charger. The one OEM (?) I bought on Amazon caused the phone to overheat. Has wireless charging, so yay!?
Has no audio jack. one can waste money on USB-C headphones or fancy bluetooth set.
All the nasty features I hated in any iPhone, Samsung has copied. Thank God we get to use USB. ;)
Fingerprint biometrics is a tricky thing. If you use some screen-protectors it plain refuses to detect your fingerprint. It also thinks my face changes 5 times a day, by complaining ""face not recognized"".
Camera is good as usual. Not a fan of Samsung apps, till somebody convinces me. A decent phone for its price, especially if you insist on avoiding Chinese makers xaomi, honor etc. But don't expect a miracle."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The quality of photo from s21 FE we can compare with Iphone 13 pro. Sometimes Samsung better"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So let's start with the screen. It's beautiful, responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.

Next up is signal. I live in a rural area so service is tricky, but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions, inside a manufacturing plant for example.

Camera is on the list too, don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera. It's not the best camera out the, but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.

The battery is impressive. I'm kinda hard on my phone battery, and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time. You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.

P.S. That Snapdragon is a monster."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like my new galaxy s21, big upgrade for me from the s7. Very smooth transition. All I had to do was swap sim cards. I have at&t."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is brand new very very happy Thank-you üòä"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super crisp display, great sound, fast, wireless charging, easy set up, so many features. This is a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT! It is totally worth the money and you won't be disappointed!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","AT&T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung online and it also advertised the dual sim US functionality. Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying this was a Dual sim capable product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring everything - apps, passwords, pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""

If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it. They want me to send back a device for a refund, now, that has all my personal and business info loaded on it with no option for me to have a working device.

Let this be a warning for those who don't read sub threads of sub threads about tech, and just believe the manufacturer (Samsung), carrier (AT&T), and distributor (Amazon) won't openly misrepresent and lie to rob you.

The battery on this is relatively weak, the memory is comparatively weak, and IT'S NOT DUAL SIM FUNCTIONAL."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have tried cheap Android phones and they all have issues. I then tried iphone and the Uber app causes overheating and dimming issues. I have had this phone for a month and it works great so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Appears to be a good phone so far speedy and doesn't appear to have any issues so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me, the battery not holding anything like a proper charge. I looked at several models/brands in a modest price range (that were also available) and since this was actually available and also since the faster CPUs seem to universally overheat (and I don't tend to play games) this seemed like a good phone to try. The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.

The best part by far though are the speakers, far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I've owned. I like to listen to YouTube while I walk my dog, don't really want headphones and this is a fantastic improvement."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered the phone and it didn't come with a charger cord, just the phone. I haven't charged or used it, yet. I recently decided to use the charger I already had, but it doesn't charge as fast. The phone freezes during app downloads, at times. I have to push button on the side of the phone for it to light up, before using it. The battery life is just ok. Overall, I like the phone and maybe this one just has glitches, idk. Probably exchange or return it. I welcome any suggestions of a nice operating/functioning affordable phone. To add, I had to replace 1st phone due to glitches. The newer phone has glitches, also, such as echoing and static, times. Called Amazon before the 90 days expire and they referred me to Samsung. Both, stating it's my cell phone company. Cell phone company tested it and states it's probably the phone. To add, the screen goes black when searching the web, now, July 2022. I've only had it for almost 3 months. Amazon will not help due to 30 day return policy, being expired. Lesson, for me, next time buy from a reputable cell phone company such as Verizon, T Mobile, etc. or maybe even Best Buy. I've lost over $600 buying this phone from Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Original product. Everything works as it should"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone S21 FE works perfectly with no bugs at all so far for 3 days. Camera is good but not excellent in low light condition. Battery drains fast with 120hz display. The phone is very fast and all apps runs without any issue. Phone call or internet connectivity works well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I used samsung phones all my life, infact my first smartphone was of samsung with google logo at its back. And this is my first S series samsung phone and I loved it! I always had issues with the phone speed, but this one's pretty great and with 256 GB of the memory with factory unlocked, the price is great! All in all totally worth the buy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I chose this phone after using my GS8 beyond its service life. I only buy a new phone every few years when. I've owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery, good screen, good camera, fast charging, 4k video, good audio, good looks, multiple colors, SD card support, wireless charging, wireless power sharing, facial unlock, etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's capable of doing most anything toy expect from a smartphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using it for a couple of month. I am not a gamer and I just use the phone for daily calling and sometimes for video conferencing. Haven't experienced any lag for the normal phone usage yet. Since I am not a heavy user, battery stays charged for more than a day. Nice screen resolution. Camera is pretty good too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone feels great in the hand. Screen is clean and clear. Battery life is atrocious, just bad, terrible. At this price point, buy a Pixel 5a, 4a, 6a, anything but this. Or step up to the S21+ or Ultra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to do a factory reset to get the GPS working, but now it's okay! 4 stars because it was very confusing and no one in Samsung/Amazon/UbrrakIfix could not find the fix after few days until I did a factory reset on my own."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty good phone. I'm still kind of disappointed by the quality of the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is disappointing. It loses 10% just sitting overnight. I may return the phone unless I can figure out what is draining the battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the larger memory version of this phone (256 gb), plus the ability to store videos on the removable memory chip. I volunteer for a concert organization and often record shows. So far, so good.
This phone doesn't support the Verizon UW 5G - but it does support the lower band 5G. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the services that use Verizon cell service do not support this phone - I'm stuck with Verizon (luckily , Verizon knocked off $10 per line for autopay). It's kinda strange, since at least one of the services support this phone.

Otherwise, the phone price and features are sweet for an unlocked device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice. The phone is beautiful well designed, is a small computer it connects to my PC and when I'm working I can receive and send messages from the PC., never mind the iPhone, this Samsung is great, if you have a choice buy it you will not regret it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for quite a while now, and am absolutely loving it. I've been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage), games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour), absolutely NO stuttering, and the camera is pretty good too.

Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.
Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off, you wont get that here.
Camera. There is 30x, but no 100x, zoom (not a big deal for me, but that might matter for you) And it probably isn't QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.
No pen. The s-pen can be very useful, but you wont get it here.
There are a few other small things, but this is all the big things I've noticed.
CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!
THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!

If none of these things are deal breakers, GO BUY THIS PHONE! ITS AMAZING!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I wish Samsung had an easy way to get rid of the bloatware. I'm paying for the phone outright and I feel I'm being ripped off with horrible software. The battery is at 20 percent at the end of the day with moderate usage. Just beautiful and powerful hardware, botched by horrendous software. I wish I could just flash a clean AOSP rom on this, I'm going to try when some tools are available (if they are in the future). I would not mind paying 50 bucks more for the same phone running the pixel like Android."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing 'Budget' about the price on this phone and yet they still found a way to justify REMOVING high use features that have been available to their 'faithful' users for YEARS on previous models. This will not be my last phone but it will be my LAST SAMSUNG!

If you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone numbers like 'Freebird' to the ex's number, 'Show me the Money' to your Accountant, and some Barry White to the new significant other then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you like to use a voicemail app that stores your phone messages on your phone so that you can in two swipes see and delete message and don't have to hit four buttons to call out to a 8** number just to hear/delete/save a message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you prefer to 'one swipe/delete' text messages from the Messaging App and do not want to be FORCED to use yet FOUR more screen touches to open the text/menu/delete/trash buttons just to delete a text message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you want to feel 100% assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging has been fiddled with where you have the 'Navy' version that the Manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of a 'Mint' cover to match the designation on a box label then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

However,

If you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub-menus then GET THIS PHONE!

If you like your phone FULL of Google and Samsung Apps that you CANNOT remove OR Disable and that will constantly be up your, er in your face on a phone that you will pay high dollar for then GET THIS PHONE!

If you want to save $100.00 from the Carriers for this model and save the extra $200.00 it would take to get a phone with real features then GET THIS PHONE!

I 'Used' to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tones associated with friends and family. Thanks Samsung/Sprint for providing a substandard product with the release of the S20 FE 5G."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen. Even with the ""block accidental touches"" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.

The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.

The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me. Same for the google pestware. But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.

Still, listening to music is a blessing! My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit. But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Completely unimpressed with this phone, and I'm coming from a 4 year old galaxy a50. The 5g occasionally pulls in some impressive numbers but it will still buffer movies or videos while supposedly having full signal. But the best part is when it just completely refuses to open anything. Bought a phone for me and my wife and we both experienced this. Pull out your phone and try to call someone...no connection. No internet. But shows full 5g signal. Speedtest shows almost zero data moving if I can even get it to connect, even if I'm on a working wifi. I had the phone for less than a month and experienced this about 5 or 6 times. We are returning both of them. Battery life was ok. Touchscreen is pretty lousy for a new phone, as was face recognition. Camera and Space zoom were the only thing impressive to me. Otherwise it didn't seem to do anything my old budget phone couldn't do"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First time buying a phone that wasn't directly from a carrier before and I was not disappointed. I did run into issues but that was more of my carrier's fault than the actual product. I purposely chose this phone so I can insert a microSD since the new phones today no longer have the slot.

I am very happy with my new phone! Easy to set up, I was able to transfer all of my data from my old phone, and I was able to use it that very same day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved this phone. Beautiful design and work excellent. Highly recommended!! Shipping fast!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.

The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.

Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.

I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After owning this phone for 2 months I'm back being a Samsung fan. My last was the S4 and the 2014 note 10.4, I felt abandoned when Samsung didn't update. Just updated to Android 11 and I commend Samsung for keeping their word on supporting this phone.

Battery life is good with heavy usage over 24 to 36 hour period. Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response, but you'll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here, I will say that I'm only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings. If you have a smart things hub you'll love the user experience with the app. My Galaxy Buds+ and Active 2 watch also have a great interface and user experience."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Does all I need and does it well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from an S10E and this is exactly what I was looking for. I've only had it a few days so I'm still playing w/the options. I haven't set up the Face recognition but the fingerprint reader works great. I am very pleased with this purchase, the cost was cheaper and very pleased with the phone itself. Thank you!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I change my 3 year old phone for this one. Ilike how fast it is and it has a lot of space. Battery is not so good but I use it a lot to play. It charges pretty fast if you have the right cable so that compensates for battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue. I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..

Now for the showstopper. The touch hardware is complete and utter trash. The October firmware update helped a bit. The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid. If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so. I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear. Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.

This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work. Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.

I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."". Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung. A screen. That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer. And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.

This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue. Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue. Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup. 100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to. The camera is decent enough and it behaves like flagship without the price. It certainly outperforms my Samsung a71 which simply gave up on life after a year. That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.

Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either... I can't tell the difference between 4g and 5g, but that could be my provider and not the phone.

In short, decent phone, good specs, battery makes this phone not perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I give the phone four and half stars for fast speedy performance, great cameras, fast battery charging, great price, and excellent expandable MicroSD card storage capacity up to 1TB. The only thing I like to see improved is the amount of RAM. The smartphone comes with 6GB of RAM. I already have 3GB of RAM used. Like to see at least 8GM of RAM. I also like the fact the phone is unlocked. You can take the smartphone to the carrier of your choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like the amount of storage this phone has, but 4 months in and it's been having issues with replaying the motion capture video for pictures. Using double-tap to light up the screen when it's off works probably 70% of the time. Swipe is terrible. I have a tempered glass screen protector on it but I have never had a phone be so bad at swipe with one on. I will try to swipe a word and end up with something completely random or it doesn't recognize the word I obviously swiped (e.g. ""adhesive"" instead of ""aggressive""). My Samsung S7 was better at recognizing than this one. Another issue with swipe is that it'll stop tracking and give you a bunch of jumbled things all broken up like ""ch a game"".

I've also had issues with certain apps, only with this phone. I am only 4 months into having this phone and I'm starting to regret my purchase. Unless it starts improving, I'm not sure I feel great about having this -- nor expecting it to last -- the next few years or so."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unstable performance. No plug in for wired earphones, some simple features missing in messages and contact/phone calls.

Every few weeks there is an update which apparently does not enhance anything. Not happy with this model of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Going from an s10 to this was a downgrade. This phone is pretty leggy with load times and doesn't have expandable memory. It feels cheap and the cameras are sub par next to the older galaxy. I expected a decent phone out of the s21 fe and got a cheap budget phone that is rather slow. Wish I got a normal s21 :(

Additionally, I've had this phone for 4 months and it has the worst battery life. Cleared all usage and the battery just drains like I'm using the entire processor constantly.

This phone went from sort of junky to absolute trash."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The speaker volume goes up and down. Sound goes in and out.Have to use earphones to have consistency. Otherwise phone is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buying a new phone online was a little sketchy but with Amazon's easy return policy I went for it, bought my unlocked s21 fe it showed up in 1 day, I put my Sim card in downloaded an app to switch all my stuff over and done brand new phone hooked up to Verizon without ever going to the store will buy my next phone from Amazon as well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Probably one of the better Samsung phones I have had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had Samsung phones from the beginning. This one, though, is terrible. So many issues. The texting rarely works well. Close to impossible to take a screen shot. Wifi goes off and on. Bad antenna. Would not ring for months. Took it to 2 Samsung repair places. Both had a different diagnosis. Samsung said there was nothing wrong and I would have to send it to Texas for analysis and they would not provide a backup or replace the phone. I bought from their Amazon online store directly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, when there should be 4's. Why? In June 2021, the sellers posted 8 GB of Ram and the phone only had 6 GB. That's false advertisement. Apparently they change their description off and on.
I lose power quicker than I imagined I would. My friend has a Samsung 9 and his power last longer than mine, go figure.

It's not a bad phone. Yet, sometimes I do wonder if it was refurbished and not new. Some little odd things here and there."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my s20 on standby before switching my service over. It lasted 10 days. Battery life with regular use last about a day and a half."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good after over a month of use. Camera is very good and clear. Battery could be better Two charge a day for normal use.
Finger print works flow less"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cool phone. Came in without being broken or scratched. Works well and transferred everything over fine. It did however come in a bit late even though I paid for it to come faster."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great purchase, as advertise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very pleased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I previously purchased the same Samsung phone listed as unlocked, but when it arrived it was not, thus phone was returned.
This phone however arrived new and unlocked as it was advertised and works like a charm, already had a SIM and just swapped it out and transferred data/contacts/pics, etc. in just minutes. My first Samsung phone, wont be my last! No complaints with seller or phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall the phone works pretty well. Biggest issue found so far is getting a good screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader. None of the tempered glass ones we tried worked well. Ended up using a soft type.

The biggest concern is OS updates from Samsung. Compared to Apple as android phones don't seem to get updates promptly and support is not as long as an iPhone from what we can tell."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has been pretty good to me in the short time that it lasted. The battery life was at 1% before it died completely only to never come back on. I charged it and still nothing. I only had this phone for 14 months. Now I am just out of luck"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am very happy with my new Samsung phone. It is a 5G with updated software that makes it user friendly. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others. I do not use a lot of data because I mostly us my phone for routine things like calls, texts, GPS, information on interesting topics. I'm not a game player and this phone provides me with all the capabilities I need at a reasonable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's unlocked so any carrier can be used with it and the camera is one of my favorite default apps to use simply because it's so crisp and clear. Even at 30x zoom it's still clear enough to read small signs about 10 cars away"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Disliked the facial & fingerprint reader, battey life was very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone in late March and on Sept 5, the phone‚Äôs charging dock started to have issues. I can no longer charge the phone via cable. I immediately contacted Samsung, was directed to ubreakifix and best buy. However after 3 visits between 2 stores, they said they didn‚Äôt have the parts. Contacted samsung again and these were the options that they gave me:

1. Sent the phone to their service center and I was left with no phone for a week
2. Trade in but I have to pay the difference for a new phone
3. Or wait indefinitely for their parts to be available.

I asked if they could send the parts to the authorized service center, ubreakifix/ best buy or my house, but they said that they couldn‚Äôt. The part that I dont understand is if they could fix my phone when I mailed it in, why can‚Äôt they send the parts to other places so I can have it fix in 30 mins or so on those authorized service center? Additionally, there is no way to get in contaxt with supervisor as well. So now I was left with $600+ phone that can‚Äôt be charged through cable. God knows if soon the battery will die on me too. Bad product but even worse customer service. Only last for 6 months before started to have issues!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone but speaker phone is not great, hard to hear even with volume at max."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Somehow the sensitivity on this never works out with the case and 2 different screen protectors I have used. I ended up ditching the cases. When doing so, be sure to switch sensitivity on it.

The camera and audio works decently. I've taken quite a few sharp photos, but just getting it now, I see the battery issue depending on apps used is a consistent problem.

The sensor for the fingerprint tip is terrible. I do have some scarring, but I can't get through it and samsung with it's security makes it difficult to bypass certain issues as they pop up seemingly at random and make me spend time going back and figuring out how to get the helpful screen to go away and leave me alone.

I like this so much I decided to purchase a different phone. I know something is wrong with a product when I pine for the s9+ with its 'edge' issues."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very upsetting üò° to me when I purchase a cellphone and there isn't a wall plug in adapter included !!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from S9 i was hesitant to got with this phone, lower screen resolution but higher frame rate wasnt enough..

I was also afraid the phone wouldnt be legit in Samsung Amazon store but wanted it asap, have prime so decided to buy it..
Came aoon enough, I dont do pics so the phone camara is not a biggy for me.

But i am blown away, the phone is quick, firgerprint reader work fast.. the position of it from the old S9 to S20fe is akward, i am used to the S9 firgerprint location but I am adapting.

Has all i need , Samsung pay, Secure folder.. though now u cant set a specific fingerprint to Secure folder, maybe they will fix that in updates..

Averall, impressed with it .. it is big.. and fast.. didnt needed to buy the flagship at all. This one has all I need."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love this phone! I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn't come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone, so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings, apps, etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.

The camera is miles better than my old one, but the selfie, front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan, like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating, but I'm not a selfie queen anyway, so I'm not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.

This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I'm pretty pleased!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung makes good hardware, so long as they aren't trying to force you pay for storage or wireless whatever. I like Android, but having had an s8+, gone to a Google pixel, then to this, i get they the os and what not might be tuned, but Google got it right and then samsung broke it hard core. The fruit may have great supporting software that rhymes with runes, but Google is making them prove they make better hardware, and it's Google all the way on OS, if you don't believe me, you have not used a Google phone, they just are better, I had more scam texts and calls in the first hour on this, than the last 4 years with my pixel, it's insane, I have a huge folder of all the samsung apps, because none of them work as well as the Google ones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I like about this phone:
It's faster and newer than my old Samsung J7, to be fair any 2020 phone is probably better than an old J7.
Love the wireless charging. I like the bigger screen and image quality is super nice, even compare to other 2020 phones. Sound is clear, even at maximum volume.
What I wish it had:
Expandable memory slot
I know other versions have it, this one doesn't. Storage is 128gb, which is plenty since I usually don't keep important files in my phone. Encrypted files in the cloud üòä
As far as 5G is concerned, it works well but there at times is really slow, so it's off for now.
In summary, I am very happy with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Big learning curve from a S6 to this one. Took 3 days just to get use to it and still can't get the buttons right to turn it off. Great color! both inside and out. Most of the features and apps I will probably never use and added a few I do use. Vendor was quick to get it here no problems,
."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I've had for years. I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20. I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network. According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating). I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home, started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon, boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store. If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work. I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon. I refuse to pay $1,000+ for an S series phone.üò†"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wifes old samsung s8 required charging all the time.very inconvenient and annoyed her.
Bought her this with more memory, more storage, better hardware. It stays charged all the time. Worth every penny. She makes her living on the phone with her business, she doesnt complain anymore about her phone-priceless."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I did receive my Android phone, the 5G Tower being in repair for weeks on, and the screen lock being on without a passcode (to know and available) to unlock the phone. Also, I did need the phone for emergency reasons. The phone takes time to learn the general operating of the phone because the phone is not as intuitive as other Smartphones that I have purchase in the past. Because of all these complications, my initial experience with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Fe 5G being not so good. The 5G Tower--this is not the the fault of the makers of this phone. The passcode place on the phone's screen; I do not know whose fault that being.

Now, the focus being on the phone only...not what some outside influences did do wrong. It is a good phone that has almost boundless options for data protection and security options. It is a sleek looking phone with good and comfortable (handheld) scale and dimensions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Going from an older IPhone to this Android has proven to be a bit of a learning curve for a senior citizen. We purchased this phone because it was hearing aid compatible. We've had a bit of problem syncing the phone and the hearing aids but that may be more the app than the phone. It has a great battery life and the camera is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung is the second biggest name in the phone and this one is pretty good one.
Everything works perfect and responsive until I ran into a glitch of the screen going dark once in a while. And I have to restart to reboot. Perhaps I got a lemon, but I contacted Amazon and they took care of the problem by refunding it immediately, after my return of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this for my daughters 15th. She hasn't complained once! So it must be pretty good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't tried the face recognition or fingerprint fingerprint reader battery life is OK"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone, every feature is top notch. Picture and video quality is a A1. The speed is A1. Face recognition is A1. Battery life is straight. A good buy for android users."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It‚Äôs ok"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worthy to buy, so far so good, I still want to see how it performs after 2, 3 years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice. An actual official phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone came wrapped in the proper packing material and a samsung super fast charger, phone was as expected with a few barely noticeable scratches. Other than the screen scratches the phone is pretty much out of the retail box. Definitely legitimate samsung product for a lot less. The phone itself runs very smooth and was indeed factory unlocked, the in screen optical fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate, the face recognition uses the phones 32mp front camera and could use some work, but is still fairly reliable. Great and fast phone even in 2021, if you can get a good deal on a S20 FE 5G, it's definitely worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charger adapter included and the cord is the same size on both endends!! I should have paid attention when it said what's included ""TBD"". Buyer beware"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far! Has a little delay when clicking on certain things but that could be user error, I'm not sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone disappointed me it had way too many redundant apps for my taste. I much prefer stock android for it's simplicity and ease of use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There's nothing I don't like about this phone so far. I did have a problem getting my email set up I had to go to my carrier to get help and all is good now. Hoping to have good luck with it for quite some time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The difference between my old reliable 4G phone and this one could be measured in light-years. This phone is phenomenally fast and easy to set up. The fan apparently did an excellent job in determining the factors to be included in the Fan Edition. It is so fast I had a near a quicker touch on the screen with my finger or I found myself lost. Super responsive, and clear and crisp display of vivid colors. I am enamored and likely to get in trouble as I can't stop fiddling with my phone to do my work."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Half the cost of phone companies, easy to set and operate excellent camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone does phone things value for money your better grabbing the 20fe instead."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got my new 21S FE phone, last night. just lightly use by playing around YouTube for about less than an hour, then I noticed the back of the phone, close to camera area, was hot. I just thought this is cheap phone, I read somewhere this phone has a hot issue while playing games (for more chip intensive usage). This morning I took the phone off wifi mode (since I am at home, phone automatically use my own WIFI for data), I want to check my att 5G speed again, but my S21 fe 5G is dead, thought phone clearly shows its under 5G coverage. when I first got the phone last night I immediately check 5G coverage, It OK, work in my area.
So, I have to suspect that last night's event of overheating that caused phones
's 5G chip dead.

Do I qualified to make this judgment without actual device testing?
I , as retired Intel chip reliability engineer for 20 some years, audited plenty of semiconductor for quality issues. This type of event is called dead of arrival , a type of early infant mortality. I just wonder, Samsung should be able to screen out this type of ""walking dead"" failure in house, unless someone is cutting corner here.

I am not happy with ATT too - 16 years loyal customer, they just cut my Huawei Mat 20 Pro off, that's why I have to purchase a new phone, but I am very unsuccessful found equal quality with equal price range replacement phone. Huawei Mat P20 pro which I used for 3 years, the price went up US$100 on Amazon. yes, the only phone I noticed price went up after 3 years used. The quality of my Huawei mat P20 Pro just has incredible reliability. There is reason Huawei is hated by every phone manufacturer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased unlock S20 5G FE as an upgrade from an old S8. Great deal at just $450 each. Battery life is considerably better and the speed access apps is lightning fast. Easy upgrade that was straight-forward. So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this to replace the Pixel 3aXL I dropped. This is fine phone with excellent 5G features that has most of the features of the new premium phones for less than half the cost. It does come with the usual amount of Samsung crapware pre-installed, which was expected. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","To me a phone should be able to 1- make calls and 2- text. Yes they do more but those are the 2 main things. This phone cannot get pics via text! I hate it. Nothing online helps. Samsung knows it and nothing is done. I can't believe I spent money after reading so many great reviews and now I'm stuck."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone last all day for me and I never feel that I am going to run out of battery. I love the cameras, they take great photos even at night. The phone is fast and runs smoothly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We were looking for new phones and got these on prime day. We didn't even have to get a new sim card, so there was no hassle whatsoever. We just traded the cards ans transferred the stuff on our phones over. So far so good. I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with battery life as my old phone which is a little bit of a disappointment, but otherwise they work fine so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","How long most I wait for my refund. I have not received my refund. The phone had issues with connection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall, if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For the most part I like the phone. Coming from Pixel 6 I think this is a good phone. Very light and well made. The display is awesome. Battery life could be better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has been a solid upgrade for me, minus an issue with my service provider. After 4.5 hours in several stores, I was unable to get this unlocked phone to connect to the Sprint Network, and had to get my account transferred to T Mobile. Butt they're the same company now, aren't they? My wasted weekend says no. If you're a Sprint user, you can get it to work on T Mobile, eventually, so expect some frustration.

That said, battery life is awesome so far. I did change the refresh to 60 HZ from 120 HZ to help it last longer. Fingerprint reader has been flawless for me. Camera is awesome. Android transfer program moved most of my stuff over, although I did have to manually reload about half of my apps. In general, I love this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had i a few months. Seems to work pretty well. A wee bit over priced like all o them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have used this phone for almost a year, it runs smoothly, has a great screen and camera, and an SD card slot! It is a fantastic value with a lot of flagship features, but at a more affordable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great value for the price with solid performance in basically every area except for one: the touchscreen during keyboard swiping. Swiping on the screen often registers incorrectly multiple quick touches and THEN what's left of the swipe. Needless to say, this poses problems for multiple apps but none worse than trying to type on the keyboard (3rd party keyboards don't fix the problem). This has been incredibly frustrating trying to communicate through text or email, or merely typing in search strings etc.

The fact that this one fault is a HUGE inconvenience and hasn't been fixed despite multiple software and firmware updates from Samsung for over a YEAR , tells me two things are likely:
1) it's not going to ever be fixed
2) it's possibly a hardware defect

For this reason, I wish I could recommend this phone, because I otherwise really like it, but I can't. Samsung deserves less than 1 star for not supporting this ""affordable flagship"" phone like it should. This was my first Samsung phone in many years and it may be my last (even typing this review on the phone took an extra several minutes having to go back and correct swiped words that the phone wrongly broke up into smaller touches)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great handset, lil dussappointed by the screen size. Over all a beast.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this to upgrade my slowish Samsung A50. The Samsung S20 is really fast and I have been using it for about a month now and it is still very fast!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There was absolutely no written information in the case with this phone. If I were a new cell phone customer I would have had no clue how to activate or use it. I like the phone, especially the battery life. I replaced my old phone because the battery didn't hold a charge. In spite of getting technical support I have not been able to have the important dates in my contact list appear on my calendar. I have had to enter them manually, which is a pain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it. Initially, I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update. This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area. The battery is excellent. I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call. The camera is excellent. Although it has 5G capability, I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon. Oh, the top ""ribbon"" is a little tough to read. Its a great phone and at a great price. My wife likes it more than her iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone will last all day and then some on battery. I always plug it in at night, but it still has lots of battery left. Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and other times it does. Not sure what the difference is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone but the battery life isn't very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder why

I wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I ""upgraded"" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.

Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.

Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you, this phone is beyond perfect, a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+. The battery life is superb, the multiple options to customize the UI is amazing, the security that this phone provides is simply phenomenal. You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off, at an affordable price! (Bought this phone when it was at $600 maybe you can get it at the same price or better) Why pay more for something similar when you can pay less for the same thing or better?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","excellent photos and the single take feature that selects photos from videos is great . the touch screen is sensitive and makes random selections if scrolling . comfortable size ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone overall. it is pretty speedy and the battery life is very good. I am not a camera connoisseur so I can't comment on whether the camera is all that it's supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I've only had it a couple of months but so far so good. I am not sure that it is worth the extra money over a phone that's about half the price for someone who doesn't really use the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really looked forward to having a new Samsung. I loved the color, but unfortunately the speaker was not working well and neither was the camera when using the flash. When on a call I'd be talking and at random times the other person could not hear me at all. This also happened when I had them on speakerphone. Obviously, this is something very important when it comes to purchasing a phone: the other person must be able to hear you during the call. Next, when taking a photo with the flash in the photo came out really blue and foggy. However, if no flash was used during the day and or night mode the picture came out very nice. I also did notice that the phone's battery percentage would go down when not in use. I've never had these type of problems with any of the many Samsung phones I've owned. Hopefully the next one will be alot better as I do not plan on ever switching to an iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","product arrived quickly... works fine... no noticeable blemishes or defects... MUCH less expensive than new"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just got the S20FE today and it looks pretty good so far, but the description on Amazon is pretty inaccurate.

This does NOT have 8gb RAM, only 6gb. This has been updated in the description now, but not when I bought it. Additionally, it does NOT come with the AKG headset which the description still says should be included. So if you don't have Bluetooth headphones, you're out of luck, or will still need to go buy a pair.

Customer service also did not help, the only solution is to return for a refund. I still need the phone so that's not a solution. All I wanted was for all the parts in the description to come."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a situation where having TWO different phones on the same page leads to misunderstandings. I went down and deliberately searched under questions for microsd.
I found:
Q: Will this phone take a memory card ?
A: It is expandable using an microSD card up to 1tb.
By Amazon Customer on October 15, 2020

Well, that apparently referred to the S20, NOT the S21. I wouldn't have bought this thing. Now I get to see if I can return it. SInce I have now opened it up... I'm doubting.
LIsten: ONLY PUT ONE DAMN PHONE ON A PAGE. Putting more than one leads to misunderstandings.
My cynical side suspects this is done on purpose. I thought I had done enough searching but I guess I failed to see."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a non-tech phone person this phone is great. The battery life is superb. I have been using an android phone since my 1st smart phone. More specifically Samsung. This is my 3rd Galaxy phone and it just keeps getting better and easier to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for 3 days. The only problem I cam across was when someone called while hooked up to my earbuds the call was not showing on my phone at all. I would hit the phone button and it would take me to recent calls or the keypad, I also tried pulling the top menu down to see if it would show as a notification but nothing. Kind of weird. Other than that, the phone was packaged great.

I used it on Cricket first then put the sim in for Metro. Truly unlocked no problems at all! Packaged great. I will update if anything changes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone for my teen and she loves it, well worth the price. The box itself did come like pictured and the phone was dusty as a result but the phone itself seemed untouched (other than by dust)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has a lot of fun features and options, love the camera, and the white back doesn't show fingerprints. Unfortunately I'm not able to review some features of the phone because it is not yet serviceable. This is really up to the buyer to contact your service provider first, of course. Spectrum (specifically) does not service this unlocked device until sometime maybe in January 2021. Possibly to due with 5G service and it being a super new device. Just an FYI as we're now left with two brand new wonderful phones without service and two quickly dying old phones trying to hang in there another month."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone expecting to use 2 sim cards and it turns out it can't. This phone is advertised with Dual Sim but it does not allow it and it does not say anywhere in the publication. This is something that should be clarified. Still the phone is very good, despite everything."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Started using Samsung devices from the Galaxy S8+, coming from years of using Sony Ericsson/Sony. I never switched back or changed brands because Samsung fully satisfied my mobile needs. Satisfied so far again with this Galaxy S21 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It took forever to come. I literally got it almost a week after the order date. Amazon told me to file a police report. I was sooo scared it had been stolen but since having it for about a day... it's so far so good. I like it a lot. Fingerprint works well haven't taken many pictures yet but the quality and zoom functions are pretty amazing. I hope it lives up to my expectations. Battery life doesn't last very long but it's not a MAJOR issue. Just holds a slightly less charge."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was offered at a great Black Friday price. When I received it, it would not start up regardless of what I did. The Amazon customer service rep and I contacted Samsung and they were not able to troubleshoot. I wanted to return the phone to Amazon and get a replacement but they are now out of stock. I'm willing to return the faulty phone and get a replacement but wanted my same Black Friday price. Amazon would not give that to me. The only option is a refund. They didn't seem particularly eager to make it work. I'm disappointed. Amazon has always been customer friendly in the past. Maybe Samsung will provide a replacement."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I don't like is that yahoo.com freezes on my phone. It doesn't do it on any of my other electronics. My phone has more than enough space and memory. It only happens on this app. I have to charge my phone daily. Maybe it's because I use it for everything instead of using my laptop."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easily transferred my information from my old phone. Easy to install sim and so card. Great reception. So far no downsides."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","great phone , does everything you need from a cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Here it advertises 8GB RAM, but RAM is 6GB

Also, Samsung's website says display is 3200x1440. But that is a lie too. Display is 1080x2400

will return this phone. Shame on you Samsung (and Bezos).

from website:
Galaxy S20 FE 5G
6.5"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED
HID Flat (120Hz)
Infinity-O Display (3200x1440)
407 ppi

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty expensive but this is the third Samsung phone I owned and I have no genitive comments to make... You get what you pay for.. Usually...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate. I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device. I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great. No Verizon calls, no Verizon store. This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon. I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out. No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Microphone stopped working after exposed to a little water. Only the top Microphone works now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone for a replacement for my Motorola X4. I liked the color so decided not to buy a case however the phone is so slick that it kept sliding off various surfaces so I am waiting for my new clear case case to arrive. Fingerprint reader is very quick but the facial recognition is sporadic particularly compared to my daughters Apple 12. Speed is very good and the 90htz refresh is good but it eats more battery so I would switch to 60htz if not gaming. Power off icon is more difficult to use than it should be."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best reliable mobile phone at a great price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The modified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the wireless charging capability. I transferred my old phone sim card for instant 5G. Some Samsung apps should be disabled and there are several good videos on YT for tweaking. I would highly recommend this 2022 version of the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome product very satisfied especially with the camera features I recommend it very highly I will buy it again if I had to!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This US version has room for two nano SIMs but only #1 will work.
Maybe you can have a nano SIM + a e-SIM, but I didn't try.

If you want true dual SIM, buy the european version.
Comes with 2 IMEI nunbers on the box, actually works with 2 SIMs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery not performing as expected"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone the first time, it was not compatible with ATT's 5G. I called ATT and Samsung to confirm that it was not related to settings or IMEI registration. I thought the phone was defective and exchanged for another one. The second phone was not compatible with ATT 5G either. I only get LTE+, which is the faster version of 4G, but not 5G. However, it could be because ATT does not have a real 5G network yet.
The phone is fine, although I am quite disappointed that it is not compatible with ATT 5G, which was one of the reasons why I decided to buy this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the idea of this phone, take last year's flagship processor and build a cheaper quality phone around it. In practice, this is a 200$ xiaomi phone with worse cameras and batteries.

In performance and network features this thing is great. The ram and processor are great, so why did you slap these inferior 12mp grainy cameras on! Ya'll even put in an SD card slot!

Good lord this could have been the phone to DESTROY this mid range market... But Samsung missed it by a hair!

Honestly if it had a better camera and an aux port I would have been recommending it to everyone who had any care for phones and tech... But not with this 500$ poco phone equivalent with worse camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The FE additions to Galaxy phones gives you most all of the high end features without the high end cost! Great cameras, easy to use and a great phone like all Samsung Galaxy phones. Finally replaced my trusty S7 edge with this phone.
Change over from old apps to this phone could not be easier."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Reasonable price, cheaper than bestbuy, and other stores. Battery life drains fast even in power saved mode. Is the only dislike I have so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was afraid it might be a fake, so I would have returned it. But this is very real. I have this phone for 7 months or more and it's for sure worth it. The camera quality is insane. That's what everyone tells me who I show my phone to. Battery life is awesome too. It can last you a whole day from 100 percent. From 70 percent it can last you 5 hours or more depending how much you use it. It's definitely worth it. I haven't used facial recognition so I couldn't tell you. But the finger print reader is really good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For the price it's OK. Fingerprint reader is just ok. Battery life is great. I wish it had dual front speakers. I like that it has expandable storage. Samsung apps store has the Epic app with Fortnite. It also has a FREE app to watch select movies and shows. (Walking dead included with ads)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to upgrade my phone desperately. I went with the Samsung because its android and not iphone. The battery life is fantastic. Signal and reception are great. I totally love it!! Best purchase ever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good battery life, camera, screen, etc. The only problem seems to be the 5G signal but I am not sure if it is the phone or the carrier problem. May be it is lacking some bands."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5G as an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ok so I bought a new phone since TMobile kept blaming my Google Pixel 3A on my bad service ( dropped calls, no connection, no internet) and I am still having the same problems. Also I hate the biometric reader on the front! Backside is much more natural and convenient. Pictures are nice battery is about the same. So really mad I could have waited a while longer to shell out for a new phone and accessories."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! Smooth with good camera quality"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is great not much to complain about. The camera is really nice and the phone itself is a good size. Best upgrade I ever bought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed a phone and this one was a decent price. It's a lot like my other Samsung but it still has a lot for me to learn. Battery lasts longer than my old one. It's bigger than I wanted but I can deal with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is listed for $600.00 or so and giving the brand I was sure jm getting a good phone .
Mic is most my issue and so is the biometrics.

Wouldn't buy again or recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always had Samsung phones love them. I made a big mistake when ordering this phone i didn't follow the instructions and lost out on the trade-in."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen doesn't light up on incoming calls.
Have to go through a couple of steps to answer call!
Calls other than priority still get through.
They should only be allowed to leave a message!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Terrible that this phone comes With no SIM card. Obviously you‚Äôre ordering a phone for the next day because of emergencies. Two days later we‚Äôre still at Verizon trying to get the Sim card set up. Will be returning"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone seems fine so far. A little large but has good battery life a d camera. However, just received the phone and found a MUCH better price elsewhere even though this was purchased on Prime Day. Do your homework and do not assume that you will get the best prices on Prime Day!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Biggest thing is that is you have to buy separate ear phones for this phone as the ones I had before do not work with this phone. I love the fingerprint reader. Battery life is good. I do not use the facial recognition so really do not have much to say about it. I've heard complaints about the size of the phone. I have no complaints. I absolutely love the amount of storage this phone has 128 G. This is one of the reasons I chose this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It came with a phone and nothing else. I had to go purchase all the accessories"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first recent Android phone. I had used iPhones for years, after retiring my old Galaxy S5 years ago.

I was absolutely blown away. For the price, this is an absolutely amazing phone. It's still a full-blown flagship, just with a plastic back and minus a camera. Huge battery. Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.

I loved it so much, I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+. But if you're not a tech snob like me, the S20 FE is a flagship without the extra flair."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","These phone are very user friendly. Don't use face rec or fingerprint yet, seems to be charging fine. Just got you know"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good. I like it a lot. We will see down the road, but right now I would say that it was a good purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall I like this phone very much after a few weeks use. It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7, so there was no particular learning curve.
What I don't like is no fault of the hardware. The location and lock screen functions did not work well on the S7, and they don't on this phone either. That may be because of operator error."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love everything about this phone, no issues.
Like the camera, takes really nice pic."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got the 8g 256. Phone is fast. Amazing quality. Didn't want to spend the 1300 on the S22 ULTRA. wish I did"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really everytime they get better with long lasting batteries (can last up to 2 days if not checking and using all the time) and also everytime better camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is my first Samsung as I have only had LG in the past. I am an android plan and have used iPhone but not owned. Setup took awhile but that may have been user not the device itself. Many features including ones I have not tried yet. Takes great pictures for a phone which is what I was looking for. Very satisfied his first month of use. Used with tracking. Slim design and large screen but not too large for my smaller hands. Love it so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item as described"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a right size, fast phone. Camera not too good but ok. Battery life is acceptable (about 6 hrs screen on ?) .
Sometimes hard to use fingerprints for waking up because screen no response and you need to use side button wake-up
screen then fingerprint... other is when you using Google map make a phone call even you change to map it jump back to call screen automatically.
I used this phone two weeks only. Probably will update the review later. Now only can gave it 3 üåü
After few months, it slower than before. Looks like the phone from China is better but unfortunately cannot used in America. This is my first Samsung product. For me , it only acceptable.
Update from 10/15/22: some apps runs very slow sometimes. Not recothis this phone. Change to 2 star"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just replacing my old phone with an update."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","could not send or recieve messages pictures, took to dealer and had problem resolved after 2 weeks and quite a hassle"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update 5-7-22: UPS found the phone and delivered it to Amazon 5 days ago. And Amazon has still not scanned it to begin processing my refund. I'm beginning to think they have no intention of refunding me. Same story over and over with my questions going unanswered. They're reading off a script and could care less.

Update 4-30-22: Be careful returning something of this price. UPS lost it!!!!! And now I have to fight Amazon for a refund!! I am beyond angry! UPS says it's up to Amazon to give me a refund, even though they lost it. Amazon says I have to wait until they get it back, or call back May 10th and beg them again for my money back!

It's a major pain in the behind. Settings keep resetting on their own, pop ups happening with everything I do, it goes back to the previous app while I'm in the middle of something, and the camera focus is just awful. Battery life is ok, I guess. I'm not a heavy user and because of the way it's acting, I end up putting it down and walking away anyway. It's going to have to go back. Sorry, Samsung, but your older OS's where a lot better than this. Thank goodness I only needed this for a back up phone for the next time my iPhone screen goes black. I'll just get a cheap Moto. They work a lot better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Smaller screen then I expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is working perfectly. I love it. I really recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone is as the description says only thing I noticed was I took the phone out the box phone is getting hot in my hand but I'll update after like a month üôÉ"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You just can't go wrong with an S series Galaxy. Love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm very pleased with this phone. I looks brand spanking new and works flawless. One of the best purchases thus far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrading from a Galaxy S6 makes this a very drastic upgrade. Adaptive display makes things scroll smooth, faster hardware makes for a snappy performance, upgraded OS is sweet, fast (enough) face recognition and fingerprint scanner and the camera... Oh the camera. Can't get enough of it.
The one thing I'd have to say makes me take of half a star is the battery life. A full charge lasts me literally 24hrs. Not sure if it was supposed to, but I was expecting something longer.
Other than that.... This phone is excellent!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not compatible, I was told it's not a 5g phone..my net work didn't work with the phone.. TMobile"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is nice, but it was disappointing to find out it does work with two sim cards as advertised and as the regular model does :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The dual SIM function doesn't work. The software doesn't allow it, so having the dual SIM capacity on the phone is pointless.

Otherwise the phone is a very nice built phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My only complaint is that I bought this when it was the latest technology. A couple of weeks after I bought it they came out with the S-21. How are we supposed to stay up to date when they push them out so fast. Having said that, I got the FE edition. I haven't seen any difference than what the other versions offer. It's just less expensive."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from a Galaxy S9, no surprises. Phone works as it should, and audio is clear. Battery life between charges is good.

I recommend this phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say except I like Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone on the deal of the day. Great price for an unlocked phone! Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is fantastic. Coming from an lg g7, this screen is incredible. Super smooth and bright. The performance of the phone is very fast and being a Samsung, you get awesome features like super fast charging. And the battery life is great. For the price, I would recommend this to anyone, esp people who don't like the pricetag on phones these days."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone claims to be unlocked. However its NO COMPATIBLE with Verizon. Dont waste your money."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely use a proper case with this phone. The screen shattered the very first time I dropped it. the front panel uses an older, cheaper, less crack resistant gorilla glass than the flagship models have. Even with a solid case the screen may still shatter if you are a klutz who drops their phone frequently. The battery life is enough to last most people a day to a day and a half. The fingerprint reader is slower and less reliable than either of my previous two phones (S9+ and OnePlus 7T), but it does work. The 120hz display is great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I LOVE SAMSUNG"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is amazing compared to my galaxy s7 edge. The battery life is excellent, the first day I had the phone I was messing around with it all day and it only went down about 35%.
I've had no problems with the fingerprint scanner or facial recognition.
The front camera or selfie camera is a little grainy but the back camera is badass. All in all very pleased so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this during amazon prime day to replace mu google pixel 3a. It's great, there's nothing else to say about it. Face id works great, fingerprint reader works great, fast processor, great streaming quality (if you know what i mean üëÄ), and camera is pretty good, nothing compared to flagship phones but it's still better then most phones. Overall, 8/10, 8 because though everything else is good, it can't run high end games, like Genshin Impact."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone a lot. The fingerprint reader is almost as good a a dedicated button, but absolutely up to snuff for regular use. Facial recognition is good as well. I have had none of the touch screen bugs after 1 month of use.

Phone is snappy and fast processing. 5G is awesome if it's available to you. (I'm on t-mobile)

Camera is very good, love the 3x optical zoom.

120hz is a bit of a battery drainer so I mostly use 60hz when I'm out and about. With that I get all day use.

Overall for the price this is a winner."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything is doing well except becoming hot after moderate use or charging. Found it is normal for Samsung phones. Have to put it into battery saving mode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the clarity of the camera on the phone. The touch is great. The battery life sucks if you're a person who receives many calls"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this is a great device if you dont want to fork out 400 dollars more for the s22"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Other than not having a headphone jack (WHY..???) - I'm very happy with this phone. All files including text messages, photos, documents, music - pretty much everything - transferred easily from my old phone to this one. Operating system is pretty much the same - also very nice. Not a fan of Bixby - it was easy to shut off. Stays charged for days. Happy with this purchase, for sure..!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am so happy with my purchase I ordered my phone in my fiancee's phone on a Sunday and both products came Monday at a decent time before we ate dinner the phones were great battery life is great everything about this phone is awesome I love that I can get ex ternal storage in internal storage I love the fact that this phone were able to put SD card in otherwise I wouldn't get that Galaxy S21 but I am so satisfied with my purchase and everything about this phone works amazingly him I just couldn't be more happy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that‚Äôs not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise I‚Äôm very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hard to charge when it doesn't come with a charger!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","4 months ago I bought this and it works really well. No missing features or glitches. I use AT&T with 5g and it works really well. Camera is really nice. Snapdragon 865 is extremly fast! It came with a standard 15w charger but I had a spare 25w charger lying around. My only regret was I wish I had gotten the white colored one but wasn't in stock at the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Replaced a Motorola Android phone with this Galaxy S20 FE and can say that it far exceeds the quality of the Motorola. Don't let my lack of rating some of the options make you think that there is something wrong with them. I haven't fully gotten into those options so it would be unfair of me to rate them. I am well pleased with the function of the phone with everything that I have used. At a $599 price point this is a great phone that functions well without putting you in the poor house to buy it. I highly recommend it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it was on time . was easy to set up .the camera is great. I 'am very pleased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very sleek, easy to use phone with a lot of perks for what I paid."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I think my screen / keyboard has a dead spot or something. When trying to use the swype feature it'll skip or disconnect. Not sure what the heck is happening with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall good phone for the purchase price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Did a lot of research. This phone proves to be capable and at a reasonable price for a workhorse phone these days. Phones can be expensive we all know. Arrived fast and in good condition. Great purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.
Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.
The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.
I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.
Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Smaller than I am used to but easy to use. Very pleased so far!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery doesn't last as long as my work IPhone or as expected. The color lavender is beautiful."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone went through a boot loop, powered off and never turned on again. Local Samsung repair shop can't fix it. I'm getting a dizzying runaround from both repair shop and Samsung. Repair shop says, ""contact Samsung"". Samsung says, ""bring to repair shop"". It's been over 3 weeks of this nonsense. One thing I know for certain: This is my last Samsung phone.

UPDATE: I had to send my phone directly to Samsung for repair. They informed me I was going to have to pay almost $500 for the repairs because it is out of warranty. Out of warranty??! Apparently it had ""unauthorized modifications"" made to motherboard and screen. I paid for a NEW phone not a refurbished one. The Samsung agent informed me I had been scammed. Now to see if Amazon and Assurion will hold up their end of the bargain here. If you are reading this: Learn from my costly mistake. Do not buy a cell phone on Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good, unboxing, this phone definitely felt like the higher end flagships. Sturdy, a bit thicker with some weight to it. Screen is flawless so far, very reactive, and the colors are vibrant. It is an unlocked phone for GSM and adapted to the SIM card very quickly. Switching from Galaxy to Galaxy is also very easy with Smart Switch. I believe it was a good buy considering the A line of Galaxies are hot on it's heels with a similar price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It meets most of my expectations it's a very smooth and quick phone. I haven't seen any of the issues stated yet though I will say the battery doesn't hold as long as was stated and the only issue I've had so far is my phone kept freezing when I would click on the wifi button and when I went to restart the phone it wouldn't turn back on after 20mins. It's fine now but time will tell."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well, it's early days yet, however, unit functioning smoothly. Forgot to purchase SD card, though will not be in need for just now. Going through features, and will update review, at a later date. In the meanwhile, can easily recommend to others. Pricing could be somewhat reduced, in reflection of other units observed within that price range. One dislike, the bloating of unessential apps., maybe to justify cost. IDK."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The headphones are not included with the device, please send them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone battery life is last until the end of the day and the display wow. One con I do have with the phone is the glass on the phone it tends to scratch very easily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first large online purchase. Always worried about how hard it may be if something was wrong. Sure enough my phone had a small crack when it arrived. Got in touch with Amazon. They sent return labels to me and as soon they received the item, I received a full refund. Got another phone and it's great. I will shop with confidence now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took over a dozen attempts to store fingerprint. Finally got it to store one but it rarely works. End up using the pin. The rest of the phone is great. The s21 is much better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this back in June 21. It took me a while to adjust to converting from an iphone, but no problems getting around in the menus now. The big plus is I dropped in my 8 ft deep pool today and everything still works properly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing has really been a problem for me out of this phone. It's awesome!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was in search of a new phone. One with more storage and better camera abilities. Samsung, as always, had just what I needed. I can now have my photography apps on my phone. And you can use SD card for additional storage (I like to save my pictures there). The camera is great... and there are more photo/video options then my last phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great storage, great pics, not so great battery life, price a bit high for the current experience I've had"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received in the mail so not much to review yet, not set up all the way. I do know that all my Samsung phones have been Great. Also I love the color."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is advertised as a dual sim, that's the main reason I got it, despite it has 2 Sim slots, the phone only supports 1 sim."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn‚Äôt like the fact that the cellphone, in fact, is not DUAL SIM which contradicts its technical specifications."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone came ok, seemed previously opened but looked brand new. Arrived in time and all that but it will not work with US Cellular or Verizon (so they said) this is a GSA and us cellular and Verizon are CDMA. Still waiting for refund, 13 days later..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After I had my pixel 3axl for a year, I decided to get this samsung phone. This is easily without a doubt the best phone I owned. All specs are good and screen is a fluid and smooth display which I like. Borderline a really good phone. It feels premium (it basically is) but of course the higher end phones will have better specs and better looking screens. But this is probably the best phone on the market for this prices range. I recommend this phone üëç it's been treating me well for the past 2 weeks and hopefully it will last me long"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great even tho I'd prefer Google-type Android."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always been happy with Samsung smartphones. After a lot of research, primarily focused on the camera and video capabilities, I went with this one. Oops. It does not follow action well and is a step down from my prior Samsung S10+. I use this for my everyday, but for pictures and video streaming I pulled out my old phone. My daughter also says the selfie mode is lacking."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I went from a Samsung 7 edge to a Google pixel 3 thinking I would have better pictures and a better phone. After 2 years of not being happy with pixel I chose Samsung S20 fe. I love this phone! Cameras are above expectations as well as all other aspects of the phone. Very responsive and easy to use. Goodbye Google Pixel 3. Only issue would be I thought I was buying a new phone, I have been unable to verify if refurbished. Box was sealed, a little dirty but phone was clean. I highly recommend Samsung S20 fe!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from a pixel 2xl this was a big upgrade for both me and my wife. It is great with the one exception that sometimes the touch screen bugs out and I need to restart it. It's maybe once a week it does that. Otherwise it is a really great phone with great performance and battery life especially at the price it is sold at."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the color, bought a clear case so I can see it. So far I'm happy with the phone and camera. There should be directions for using the camera instead of going to YouTube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got our Business phone up and running again, and without the huge charge AT&T prices their Cell phones for!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say, it's a Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from galaxy a20 this is a great upgrade and budget friendly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All the things a smart phone should do -- quickly and reliably"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just a lil disappointed when they took the extra storage (SD card) away that was a big help on my older models! It's cool thoughüòâ"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's an pretty solid phone:+ Has pro features: * Fast charging compatibility * Wireless charging * Fast refresh screen at 120hz+ It makes the correct compromises: * Plastic rear with a nice finish, doesn't feel cheap * No curve screen (for some people its a plus)- Cons: * The included charger isn't the fast charger that matches the phone capability. * Doesn't include any extras: * No phone case * No earphones * No USB-C to headphone jack converter"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cell phone battery doesn't seem like it holds all day. My other cell held all day. Haven't used face or fingerprint reader yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So, coming from a Galaxy S7 I'm obviously in love with this phone. I have zero complaints. If you customize your phone correctly you'll have more than enough battery life and it charges very fast.The camera is just phenomenal. The phone is light but sturdy, and very easy for me to read as someone in their 40s.I'm just very happy with it. I would suggest buying a case on Amazon at the same time because I couldn't find one anywhere in town since it's an FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I gifted this to my husband. He works from home and mostly uses phone to be on webex meetings or conference calls atleast once a day for work reports. This phone hangs up/gets disconnected suddenly which never happened with his old phone. When he tries to reconnect to the call, he did not get connected. Sound quality is also not up to the mark. I gave two stars just for camera quality. Battery dies faster compared to his old phone. He switched back to his old phone, and I'm returning this. I bought S22+ for him which is arriving shortly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charger found in the box. Please supply one otherwise the phone can‚Äôt work without a charger.Thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My second Samsung, I found it pretty easy to use. Battery life seems good... A full day for me. Fingerprint reader works fine. Wish I could easily color code calendar items, but it seems that I can't. Nice phone tho. Like it a lot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Absolutely loved the phone. I've been using it for about 1-2 months and it is still such a perfect phone. The camera is good but it doesn't zoom when you turn it to the front, but it's completely fine because it zooms a lot when you turn the camera to the rear. The battery life lasts me a long time, I'd say 2 days if you're using the phone. Fingerprint reader reads my fingerprints really well. Everything is working right!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Before I bought this phone I was a bit skeptical because of the reviews people wrote. But to my surpise it works just fine. I put in my sim card from my other phone it connected to my at&t service with no problem, the battery life is great, and the camera is awesome. I would only say i wish i had got the cool mint. But for anyone having doubts, my other phone was the galaxy zflip an that phone was a headache, this phone is way better thumbs up! üëç üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is great and lasts longer than any other phone I've had. When using it I immediately noticed how fast and smooth it was from switching between apps and playing games and scrolling on Insta. I absolutely love it. I'm glad Samsung ditched the glass backs and went back to something more solid. It has a good size screen and nice weight to it. I added a Spigen case and screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The lack of clear instructions for a newbie. All the apps and ads put on in factory. I paid enough for the phone to not have the irritation of trying to disable them all. Weeks later and I still do not know most of what the phone does. Other than that it is a necessary evil. This is my first smart phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I thought i would recieve something to send my trade in back to factory ???"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this phone so much that when mine was smashed intentionally into the concrete, it took two times at full human strength of a 6 foot tall man to make it not work anymore. I did not hesitate to replace it with the same SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The phone is great value for the money I spent. I also recommend this too. https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Samsung-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B08KFPG514/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_5/144-6656309-3446512?pd_rd_w=9j7YN&pf_rd_p=c5176ee3-b609-4196-9e4e-395444c24cf6&pf_rd_r=BDX5XCHK1A6WH7VR80A1&pd_rd_r=51830fd5-f828-4c59-b33e-a7d6c5e8e88d&pd_rd_wg=3qwHk&pd_rd_i=B08KFPG514&psc=1"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone found and received and looks in good shape, will update further once we had some time with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a hard time deciding between 2 other phones and this one, but I'm very happy so far with this S20 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable. Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a good all around phone. It has a lot of ""flagship"" features for a decent price. The in screen fingerprint reader is a little tricky to find until you get used to it. It has a good screen, cameras, processor, and battery. It's also nice to have a choice of six colors."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You're always taking a gamble when you're ordering from a reseller, and it's always the luck of the draw on what you'll get. I'm a full-on nerd and would notice anything wrong or glitchy about a phone not to mention the way it looks... In my case I got an impeccable phone that performs impeccably and I couldn't be happier...My advice is to take the chance on this reseller and buy your phone. If it ends up being crap you can always send it back because you're buying from Amazon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The product was rated by PC Mag as the best 5g for the money. It's a great phone, a little taller than my old ASUS that died. Amazon delivered this phone within 3 hours of my ordering it along with the case I ordered. It's too big for my wife but I just ordered her the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, can't wait to see it. I am very impressed with Samsung..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is not as user-friendly as my LG was. Still working on finding all the settings that I am used to having and also trying to eliminate the ones I don't need or want. Best thing about this phone is the longer battery life."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Basically the title (but I will add this: I would recommend watching some tech reviewers and get their opinion before making a purchase). I'm docking one point for a weird bug that forced me to reset my phone (Android had failed to boot, then came back glitching with apps not working and whatever. It was weird, and i don't fully understand what caused it to happen)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not much difference between this and my previous a51. I only got this because the charging ports kept failing on my other phones and this has wireless charging, but otherwise not worth the increase in price. Also comes with a USBc to USBc cable which requires you to buy an outlet adapter separately to even use your phone once you get it which is absolutely ridiculous."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My wife loves the color"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint reader works well. Other features are glitchy. The battery life is terrible."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything about it! It's absolutely a small laptop and more!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought used and arrived in great shape. Upgrade from S10 and chosen so that I would be able to keep using my 256 memory card. No issues with phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had earlier given this phone a 1 star when I thought it had no SD slot... but with the help of a friend... I located the slot behind the sim slot...this would have been explicitly stated in a diagram... but that I did not see ... am updating my review to 4 Star will increase or decrease my rating based on how the phone performs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my Samsung fan edition. It does absolutely everything I need to use it for. It did not come with a user manual (fortunately I bought a book that showed me wonderful short cuts and useful information) I did have one incident of overheating with no obvious cause. I turned it off and did not use it for several hours. It has not done it again. Battery life is exceptional!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works on Tmobile perfect. I am a happy customer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Initial thoughts on battery life were not so good, so I moved from 120Hz screen refresh rate to 60Hz and got an instant boost.However, later I moved back to 120Hz, because I paid for that feature, and to my surprise, the battery life was better. This must have been due to optimizations and the device learning how I use it.Overall, great, versatile triple camera, smooth 120Hz display and awesome software."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love having the galaxy s20 fe, such a huge upgrade from my s8. The battery life is my only complaint. I've had it for 4 months now, and I can tell it's already not holding its battery life long. That makes it really frustrating sometimes. Other than that I love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love everything about this phone. Very pleased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have not set up face resolution. Fingerprint set up before putting Screensaver and might slow down the recognition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm hard on phones. This was a great 5g option for me that I don't hesitate to drag out in to the wilderness."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ended up returning this phone. It‚Äôs a really good phone but I just personally didn‚Äôt like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It‚Äôs a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I‚Äôve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Cool color!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my phone. Great pictures and long battery life. Didn't like that my charger is not 25W but a 15 so charging is not like 45 minutes to 1 hour instead of super fast charging capabilities. Has extra space for an SD card to increase your memory. 5G phone. Great for the price! FE doesn't have dual Sim so if you need that then buy the S20"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","With the idea that I thought/expected this item to be less better than it actually is, it surprised more than what I thought, it came with a charger, it's headphones as well as every thing necessary for its function plus, it was actually unlocked unlike the first phone I bought, it is nice and amazing if I was able to buy another I would exactly right here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is everything you could ask for in a phone. The camera on this phone out performs the IPhone 12. All my friends with an IPhone were jealous of the camera. The camera is my favorite thing. 30√ó zoom is amazing. I could take pictures of animals from a good distance away without scaring them off. Incredible. I have had no trouble at all with this phone. There is zero lag. 120 hertz display is gorgeous. You will love this phone. It's a steal for 600 bucks"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone seems to be up to partner with the Samsung product quality. Nice. Stable. Structure. However. The charging unit is different from previous models (Mico USB perhaps?). Seems like it'll last though. The main reason I like Samsung..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only received it today because of local delays due to CV19. However, on the US side, delivery was fast! Love the colour! So far, so good!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far it's a pretty cool phone. Really fast processor. Picks up 5G when it's around. Like that it has expandable storage. Fits well in my pocket even with the silicone case.Wish I could have different notification sounds not just one sound for everything."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received these phones, we upgraded our house to three Galaxy S20's on Prime-Day Sale, we can't complain thus far. Very responsive and manageable with one hand. Easy to transfer over all files, easy to get the phone activated and running.... pull the sim form the old phone and pop it into the new GS20, start it up and on the 5G Hwy...I recommend so far *thumbs up*"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the best Samsung phone to date. It's the same feeling I felt when I got the Note 4 and S8+ years ago even though there are features in Note 4 and S8+ that aren't in S20 FE like taking your oxygen saturation which is important for me during pandemic, but still the phone is so good that you can forgive Samsung for not including that feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery lasts ALL day. Glad I got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought 1 year ago. This Samsung FE20 5G does everything perfectly! !Best phone I ever had. Have owned 9 phones in last 18 years. Not one single issue.Samsungs are awesome !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The storage is good and it has alot of good features but the battery could be alot better. I love the fingerprint reader but if you use wifi or Bluetooth for anything the phone will die in just a few hrs."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded to this phone after my S8 died and boy do I love it.Had to get used to a bigger phone but otherwise the specs were awesomeIt's sleek, has a great camera, awesome processor and welcoming features abe UI. And for the price it comes, it just begs to be loved. So happy with it. Def recommend as a cheaper alternative to S21"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this for my son and he loves it. We haven't had any problems with it. He says the sound is great on it and the battery life is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you are looking for a good purchase this is one.However I have found two draw backs it doesn't come with earphones and thenotification light has been removed.If you are OK with the two drawbacks listed it would be a good purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works and looks like a new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","5 weeks in and 2 firmware upgrades and it gets better and better.Finger sensor still misses sometimes but not a constant issue. Software so far is spot on no wanky issues.Speaker is plenty loud. Lots of bloatware but fairly easy to remove.Battery last all day if not constant video watching."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked its speed of operation, its sharp screen, its stereo speakers. I didn't like the lack of a pulse oxidizer like my s7 had. Samsung smart switch worked well in transferring data."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well! Phone arrived new and unlocked as advertised! Easy to switch SIM card from old Samsung phone to this new S20 FE 5G model! Love the screen size, east to read for ageing eyes! Phone functions as expected! Apps and data was transferred easily and automatically through ""smart switch"" Happy with purchase, would recommend!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Before this phone I had a rinky dink free phone that was slow and laggy. I bought this and it was such a major upgrade. I use cricket cause I'm both Mexican and broke n I was able to use my old Sim card (I wasn't sure the phone would be compatible tbh). The phone came with everything it said it would come with and so far no problems whatsoever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well this is a definitely a big upgrade from my lg g stylo 5. With plenty of space on the phone, faster ram and better battery life the phone is really great. And the camera is by far one of the best I've used in a long time. Well worth the money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I switched from the Samsung A12 to this. I was sent one of these phones and realized quickly that the battery life was not good. My old phone had a better battery. So I sent it back and got another sent. This seems to have slightly better battery but wont last me all day. I can get through probably 8 or 9 hours of on and off use on this phone before having to charge. Considering I got it on sale I would say the $100 dollar savings compensates for this but still a little upset."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","nice one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Maybe I got a bad S21FE but my screen has cracked in two places in less than a week. Otherwise I was fairly happy with the phone. I've never broken a screen before but this one first broke while it was in the cupholder of my car, it was fine when I put it in the cupholder but cracked when I took it out. The next day I put the phone in my gym shorts pocket with nothing else in the pocket and drove to the gym, when I took it out while walking into the gym I found another crack. Back to my old S9 since I just wasted $600 on this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The 2020 Black Friday price ($549) made Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G a great deal at Amazon. It is a function-rich phone with good quality. Everything works as expected. I have no problem with it so far. It does feel a little bulky and heavy, needing some time to get use to it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved the product. No issuesWorked fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is not very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone does everything I need it to do and it does is well. The only problem I have is the back of the phone can pick up fingerprints really easy. But other than that its perfect. The battery life is also amazing I can go through the whole day using it at max performance and I still have battery left over."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Beware of no headphone jack, solution: buy an adapter. I panicked at firts because I don't like be charging constantly Bluetooth headphones. The phone is beatifull designed and the images and photos won't disappoint. But for the prize should include the adaptor and headphones.I just got it so I may update again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered the Cloud Orange, as Orange is my favorite colour. Problem is, it's not even orange. It's a peach color. So I'm returning it and getting the Mint Green instead. Otherwise, phone is responsive and works great. Good Photos as well. Happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works great, big improvement and upgrade from my ancient Galaxy S5 LOL. Runs quick and is nice to not have the carriers bloatware installed. Screen is sharp and bright, 120hz is also a plus. Been using my phone much more since upgraded to this.Update, if you want 5g to work with ATT Prepaid, make sure you update your IMEI number online or at the store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is THE BOMB!! I absolutely love it üòÄ. Although, I am upgrading from a Samsung galaxy S7... kinda a big upgrade, but I can tell you, this phone is worth it. I loads fast, its stylish, and it comes in many colors. The only issue I've had is I can't find many good cases for the phone in store around me. This phone at the moment is still kinda new, so finding a good case can be a little bit of a challange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What a great phone and value. If you're looking for a flagship phone minus just a very few bells and whistles look no further. This phone is amazing, fast and has a great camera and features. Came unlocked as advertised. Did the transfer from my old S7 by myself with no problems. Highly recommended! Saved a lot of money!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone came already opened. The phone seams fine though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not used face or fingerprint recognition on the device. I find the pattern lock screen works best for me. This is an awesome phone though have only had a few days and it keeps getting better. I had a lower end samsung phone before this one and wow what a difference. Smart switch is awesome also worked flawlessly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using this phone for almost a month and it's amazing. It's superfast and smoothe. The battery life on this phone is really good. It also takes a short time to recharge. The display is beautiful and my favorite feature is the dolby atmos sound that comes from both speakers. With the high refresh rate the battery life is still excellent. A decision you would not regret. Buy it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've had so far! I love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I put in my old Verizon SIM card and it works! Much faster than my old Samsung J7V. Fast forward 3 months. I tried to switch to Xfinity (supposedly uses Verizon equipment) and the IMEI search said it is not compatible. I can switch to AT&T but they suck here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb, and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though! The front-facing camera has a little silver ring around it that makes it super noticable, and the phone seems to get pretty hot due to the plastic back, but otherwise I'm pretty impressed with this thing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Since starting writing this review, this brand new from the box phone has updated with the same description for the 17th and 18th times. I have not been able to do anything with the phone. If I attempt to open anything in the phone,it was postpone update. I've had to keep the screen lit up and have tried everything but I do not see an end in sight at all. I need a phone. Even if it actually is updating real necessary updates, this is ridiculous. I checked to see if the storage amount changed at all but it seems to be the same after supposedly several cycles of updates. I will be returning it and going to the phone store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unlocked phone using Verizon service and this phone is the worst ever! The most awful coverage for one but I am going to try t-mobile. The phone itself is nice and light and very slim. Takes decent photos and is fairly quick using wifi but that's where it ends. The operating system does not like this phone which makes it horrible. Touch screen doesn't react a lot leaving you pounding the screen in frustration. The phone lags and freezes at times when doing things of little processing power. It will then freak out to catch up and by then you're ready to take a hammer to it! This is the norm and not a rarity. Samsung has been putting out trash lately and it makes me question if I'll go to the Z fold phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Brand new phone. Seems to be fully unlocked as I'm using in Dominican Republic and all company's sim cards works perfectly.I haven't encountered any issues with it. Battery life could be better but maybe is because I'm too happy to stop playing with it lol.Camera could be better, specially the ""30x zoom"" which is bs, but I didn't really buy it for the camera so I don't care."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall the s21fe is a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was skeptical at first but the phone was delivered on time! Everything came as it should and brand new!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone, no problems, not too big."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This replaced my very cheapie moto G6, which was ok, but the charging port was getting wonky and not worth fixing. This is a faster phone for downloads. A bigger screen. Not light in weight. Still getting used to it, but I like this S20 so far. It was a very good deal on Prime Day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just what I expected. It works perfectly in Honduras. I definitely recommend it üëå"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Man, like the phone but ""cloud red"" equals PINK. Not happy with the color or the representation of the color on the website. Hate that I purchased a clear case for it. I guess I just live with it for 2 years. Probably buy another case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was replacing a Redmi K20 Pro after it started showing problems with the display. I was certainly amazed with the features on the device as well as its performance. I loved the utility to transfer the information from the old phone to this one. The battery life is great. When the time comes to replace it, I'll probably go with another Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung FE 5G is a great device. Face unlock is not as fast as the OnePlus 7T and other one Plus devices. The 865 snapdragon is more than enough processing power you will ever need. Great display altho wish it had gorilla glass 5 or 6 vs the older Gorilla glass 3 version . Put on a case and screen protector and you will love the brilliant display and solid performance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good~!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The reviews are right. This is an awesome phone. People say its great for the money but that I feel degrades the perception associated with it. This phone does everything I need it to do but be advised the speakers seem a little soft, the fingerprint scanner is a little laggy. The batter however is a monster . Nothing to complain about. Love this device I think I made a smart choice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone after I lost my budget android (Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s) and it was the perfect fit for me. The quality of the finger printer was surprising and quite convenient under the screen, and a found the battery life to last me throughout the day consistently. Great phone if you are trying to spend a little less money but still get a pretty high end product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is powerful and fast, the camera is very good. Using the Samsung app, transferring data from my old phone to the Galaxy was simple. The phone is slippery and you should order a case when you purchase the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't had a Samsung since my old S6. Was buying cheapies for a few years and it just has not been worth it. Ever so glad to back with Samsung because quality is indeed the less expensive way to go. Do yourself a favour and DuckDuckGo ""Boots theory of wealth"" to see what I mean.Sure the S20 FE 5G is not fully an S20 or S20+, but it is a very nice device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was a great upgrade for me. I got the 128gb with SD card slot and I am in California and it's hooked up with t-mobile no issues. All in all we'll worth the purchase for the moment, but will keep my eyes open on the s21 fe should it be similar."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had LG phones for a number of years. They worked very well, but had problems, and didn‚Äôt last that long.Replaced with this Samsung S20FE. Right away, I can tell that this Samsung is inferior. Issues with face recognition, fingerprints, finding downloads, talk to text is terrible, etc. etc. My only hope is that it lasts like three years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm in love with this phone, and I'm not even a phone person. I had grown increasingly unimpressed by the IPhone family of phones. I have an acquaintance who has the Note, and I began researching Samsung products. The picture is so vivid when I play a video, the camera is wonderful. I could go on and on... I think I'm sold on the Samsung mobile phone line!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","did not recieve a phone charger with s21 phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen is totally black while in the camera app. but fine to use with other apps. Screen is not damaged and not misaligned, and it happened overnight--worked one day and not the next. I feel Samsung has NO customer service. Totally unhappy since the camera was the main reason I bought this phone. Apple will be my next phone I guess."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for about a month now and let me tell you it's great, I love the camera quality and the battery life. Keep in mind that I use it heavily, sometimes I'm in ft for 9h and the phone keeps running perfectly fine while connected to the charger and it never overheats. I definitely recommend it, it's worth the price and more"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great phone. Even being ""renewed"" it was in right out of the box condition. Had issues trying to figure out why it wouldn't upgrade to 5g service(because I'm using my Samsung so sim card). Truly an excellent phone at an excellent price. It takes great photos too. The phot of the moon was taken at max zoom."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is advertised as a dual sim but it's not."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So many problems, I don't know if I got a bad one or what.1. touch screen seemed iffy, sometimes it worked, other times I would have to tap several times2. Wireless android auto had constant dissconect issues3. Wired connections wouldn't work have the time, it would charge but data connections wouldn't work4. Network, wifi, and bluetooth issues, constant slow speeds (0.2 down), bluetooth was spotty and would disconnect often. A format would fix these issues then they would come back a few days later and I had only 2-3 apps installed since I used this for work.Amazon agreed to return it while outside the return period, but I am taking a loss on a ""restocking fee"", biggest dissapointment I have ever seen in a phone, especially one with flag ship specs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is fast, perfectly sized, and works wonderfully. I like it much better than my iphone 11. I also have a Xiaomi and prefer this samsung. The camera has great zoom and can take beautiful pictures in low light. Definitely recommend this phone. Battery life is decent.Con:I am not a huge fan of the on-screen fingerprint sensor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing product for 549 very competitive against iphones and other Android phones. Very capable triple camera setup, fast 120fps display, fast charging, long battery life and good software support. I highly recommend this device, it also has certain features the s21 doesn't have, for a cheaper price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","very satisfied great camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to replace my old phone and this one was recommended by my son in law. Haven't tried the face recognition or the fingerprint reader yet, but the battery life is good. Was a little hesitant on the price though, only because I don't use my phone much, mostly for games, social media and internet. I did find one for a good price though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This replaced a Samsung Galaxy S6 which was good for years but didn't last long on a charge anymore.Great screen and camera, lots of advanced features, and excellent battery life. I transferred everything over from the old S6 with the Samsung SmartSwitch program over the network and that worked perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a awesome flagship spec phone! Excellent screen size ,smooth hardware power and great value for the price today!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There are so many great features to this phone! Battery life is amazing, very user friendly, Great value for the money. Most phone companies want $700-$1000 for this phone üò≥ So much technology for the price and the amount of storage is A+++I haven't used the face recognition yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not yet used the fingerprint or face recognition features. I fear that I may not have this phone for 2-3 years - my usual phone life. This phone is sometimes hot, even while sitting there unused, and sometimes it overheats while charging. Other than that, I really like the phone, it is a little big (with a case, it does not fit the phone holder in my Toyota), but It is easy to use. I like that I can insert an SD card for storage - this is the reason that I purchased the S20 FE 5G, and not the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good one..worth to buy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I inserted and installed the sim card but the device won't recognize it and it's now jammed so I can not remove it. I tried going the esim route, but AT&T thinks it is a watch, so I can not use it for its primary function.It is pretty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn't receive my ejection pin... makes me wonder if this is a brand new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone hit almost all the checkmarks I had for a new phone. Besides the price, on sale for $549 on cyber Monday, it has a flat screen and no glass in the back - main reasons I stayed away from a regular S20.. It's also larger than the S20.. Performance is great; it's fast, has a great display, and a very responsive finger print reader.. Very pleased so far! Knock wood!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone for my wonderful wife. She absolutely loves it. It's a very pretty device. Not much more I can say about it because I don't use it. I can tell you that I'm waiting for the S 21s to take hold so I can afford to buy a new S 20 Ultra. See you in the funny papers, lol"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only after 8 months, I'm no longer able to send a picture outside of the Consumer Cellular network. For what ever reason, Consumer Cellular IT people are unable to fix this bug. The phone may work well on other networks, as it is a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We bought it on 2/5/22, and it worked well at the beginning, but it could not receive calls from 8/24/22. We transferred the SIM to the other old phone; it worked well in the old phone. We transferred the other SIM into this Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, it still could not receive calls. We reinstalled the system of this Samsung phone and updated it with a new system today (10/6/22), but it still could not receive calls. How to fix it, where to get the repairs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a little taller than I would have liked. I used to have a s5 phone. Other than that so far so good. Battery seems to be lasting good. I think getting a case for it will help with the handling of the phone. A little slippery without one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from Galaxy S8 to take advantage of T-Mobile 5G network. I miss some features of the S8 like the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone and the notification light but in all the 5G is getting me much better coverage at my house where I need it the most. The phone works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In the description it says dual sim, however sim 2 is not being read. Also it says 8gb of ram but when checked it's actually 6gb of ram."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a far and away improvement on my LG G6. Loads apps faster, clearer calls, and the Samsung built-in apps are keepers. So far, great battery life. One issue, my wife's phone lost network connection to T-Mobile, came back after reboot. Maybe need a new Sim card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the phone used and it had a small amount of scratches on it but, it seems to be working fine. The photos look good and the phone is fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone 11 days and it was supposed to be an upgrade for me from a cheaper brand of smartphones. The cheaper brand was good, but didn't last long. Now I miss those cheap ones.My new 20 FE 5G sometimes won't read my fingerprint. Annoying, but I just enter my pin.However, last night I tried and failed - over and over - to copy and paste something. It appeared to copy, but kept pasting the previous text I'd copied.I don't have a lot of money and this was a stretch for me. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone.EDIT I've now had this phone 3-3¬Ω months and, without exaggeration, I can say I hate it.An alarm began ringing today and it only stopped when I turned off the phone.Calls come in and I only know I've gotten them when I find a voicemail or look at Recent Calls.To paraphrase a friend - You know how 'phone' is spelled? It starts with an 'F.'"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing to complain about"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Feature packed phone at a decent price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is far too expensive for what you get. Also if you plan to use a micro SD card you need to know this phone has no support for micro SD so you are stuck with the 128GB storage amount.Waste of money, for the price there are much better options. Plastic back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a refurbished phone it was not cleaned properly; around the back camera and the scratches at the back were more than noticeable. If I knew better I would have paid the extra for a brand new phone. I do hope it will give me battery life and a good 2 or more years of use. Further to this I will be giving it a month of use and if any glitches would for sure contact Amazon and the seller"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We have two Samsung S20 Fe 5G smartphones. We purchase one directly from T-Mobile locked to T-Mobile we purchased this phone from Amazon unlocked. We had T-Mobile installed this phone on T-Mobile network. This phone will NOT connect to 5G T-Mobile network whereas the phone I purchased from T-Mobile will connect. All settings on both phones are identical."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is good and WAY more storage and memory than my old phone. But no plug for my earbuds and I don't like the wireless type earbuds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has functional and touchscreen issues. Had to be pressing several times in order for it to recognize the touch, it has functional issues even after the phone is updated and overall was not a good experience. It felt like an old phone though ut was brand new. Very frustrating! Not recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this for my birthday and was frustrated with it out of the box. I have an older Galaxy and fond it meet all my needs. The new Galaxy s20 FE is setup with the side power button automatically opening Bixby. . . total BS. Easy fix once you dig into the setting. The much bigger issue is Bluetooth, or I should say almost Bluetooth. It inconsistently recognizes devices. After multiple attempts finally got earbuds working.Hopefully I can get all the little annoying glitches figured out and make this a phone I won't regret getting."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very dissapointed. Biggest problem, the battery drains after 4/5 hour of light use (even with its battery saver mode and dark screen). I can't believe is so bad for a flagship phone. Face Recognition is terrible as well. Most of the time you are forced to enter your password. Avoid"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm very dissapointed due to the fact, this phone lacks Dual Sim. The only reason I bought this phone because it was discounted on Black Friday to $525 approx. I have to carry two phones with me now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone sold at a much better price than any of the other places I looked.The battery life is really good. After heavy use there was still 50% battery at the end of the day.My wireless company was very helpful in getting it set up and transferring all the data.The old phone was getting tired and slow. This one is much faster"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got this phone and charged it to 100%. Hardly used it on two and a half hours and it's already lost 30%. Starting return as this phone won't last a day without normal use of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone won't connect to a 5g network. Spent hours on the phone with Amazon and Samsung tech support with no help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because it was ""unlocked"" and the Seller advertised that you can ""choose your carrier."" I spend 6 months in the U.S. then 6 months in Mexico and do not want a phone with 2 SIM cards. With an unlocked phone I should be able to switch out SIM cards depending on which country I'm in. I've done that before with a phone I bought in Australia. This phone accepted my Mexico SIM card and worked fine in that country. But I just returned to the U.S. and have taken the phone to 3 major carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. Employees of each of those carriers told me that the phone is ""not compatible"" with their service and they could not get it to work! Of course when I contacted the Sellerhe/she said the warranty had expired and it was a Manufacturer's defect. I had no way of discovering the problem during the warranty period and the phone is not defective in any way! It's just not compatible with U.S. companies. Which means the Seller advertised it falsely in the first place!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the phone but didn't like that it wasn't brand new. It gets hot. I love the fingerprint and I love the wireless charging. I work from my phone and it does exactly what I need with quality photos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am coming from a Samsung 7 and loved it. The battery was going and was debating of putting in another. I decided to go with the 5G option. It's the future. Screen is beautiful, vibe, camera is better than the 7 which I thought was good. Would buy again, and it was a great price when I purchased it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We moved from a Samsung Galaxy S 5 to the S 20 FE. Major leap in upgrade technology. Our 1st time buying an unlocked phone. Few hurdles for a couple of weeks. Now, still learning about all of the things I have NEVER heard of.Great Move on our part."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","found the phone to be hard to understand the functionality of thise phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just the right size & performance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The display is wonderful. Very smooth and vivid colors. I upgraded from an S8 and the phone is much more powerful. The transition was also seamless. The bigger screen/keyboard is taking some getting used to but it is a major upgrade. The camera is incredible as well with many more features than my previous phone's."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sorry to say that this is the second Galaxy phone I ordered by Amazon, the first one was defective, the second one should have been new, but was refurbished and the add did not say that."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it is fast, smooth, good camera, the only thing that bothers me is the weight . it is little heavier than my old phone (note 5). One other thing if you watching videos on you tube and if you try to fill the screen at first you think it looks really great but if you play same video on the device than you know it cut out some portion of the video"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the 2nd one our family has ourchased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this on Prime Day sale for half the price and frankly it was a steal deal.This phone is so good, its as good as a flagship phone. Its got a large bright AMOLED display with one of the best camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","good phone for money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the Samsung galaxy s20 fe 5g. I love the color. The size is great. I love the camera quality it is like I have a dslr camera. The video quality is fantastic. The processor in the phone is so fast to respond. I love the fingerprint sensor. I give thus phone 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a green tint when i would put the brightness below below 20% probably which would make other apps have a kind of gray and blurry view on the phone. After reading the comments i disregarded them because I knew about the phone but unfortunately I got a defected one . My mom and uncle got the same phone and theirs are fine and work great but i think I'll buy a different phone after returning. I noticed it right after the box so I personally didn't get to experience the phone for more then an hour before boxing it up again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone does not have visual voicemail mail. You can't pull up the phone see who left you messages! That totally blows. Deal breaker, had I known.The phone comes with a micro card slot, and takes up to 1 TB cards. Try that Apple.Battery life is great.Also the contact charger, erases the card. Doh!I would not purchase again!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's thinner than the s9. Big fn whoop. The battery life is no better and that is what I really care about. They could make the battery twice as big and the phone wouldn't be noticeably heavier. So now I have to buy and lug a battery case just like i did with my s9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was very disappointed when I got the phone. It was a used phone but I was supposed to get a new phone .It didn't have the right cord and the seal on the box was broken; also no instructions. I am returning this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good value for the money, flagship specs but for a lower price. The only thing that cut me off guard was the color of the phone, i bought mint cloud but i looks like a pail blue kinda a71 baby blue. But other wise good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this as an upgrade to my daughter's old S7. Outstanding phone and for the price...you can't beat this. Unlocked and only needed to go to a local Sprint/T-Mobile shop to get a Sprint SIM card and worked flawlessly. Highly recommended especially the color since the local Sprint/T-Mobile stores do not even sell in this Lavender color. A+++ Thank You."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was a gift for my grand daughter. Though it was not a open box item, as per her it's airphon was missing. Is it possible to obtain this missing item from the sellor?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought as gift, so far so good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty great phone. Camera quality is nice and although the fingerprint reader works 80% of the time its not a big enough deal to bring it down. Battery life lasts pretty long depending on what youre watching or doing. Charging takes awhile but if you turn on the fast charge its not so bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Much faster than my Google Pixel 3. Worked like a charm right out of the box. Easy SIM card swap. I need to get used to the controls, as I have had Google phones for years. Fingerprint reader is perfect. Set it up to read your thumbprint . That way you can do everything with only one hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After my mom was nagging me for a new phone (Motorola doesn't really hold up IMO), I bought her this one on the payment plan. So far she seems to love it, and I do notice the faster screen refresh compared to my S10e (Comparable to my Note I gave away). Its too big IMO but she loves it so I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super happy with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My wife is very happy with her new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Great photos, lots of space, excellent quality at an affordable price. The speakers are very strong, I suggest to lower it a little before your phone rings."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the cell phone I ordered. It's great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am surprise with this phone. It last all day without charging, even when I watch videos for long time. It has so many features that I'm still discovering. I got it during the Prime days (so glad I did)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update~Bought 2 replacement was also stuck in a loop! Replacement also repeated 2 words in a row in most sentences and added words. I called Samsung on the replacement. After close to 2 hours they admitted that it can't be fixed! They kept changing the subject until I forced a yes or no answer to the question, "" Can you fix this problem?"" Samsung said, "" No."" I'm not the only one because I Google it. I've done it about 9 times and followed Samsung directions to wipe the cache. It did it 2 more times! Also Almost every sentence I write I write it will repeat 2 words in it twice and it just did it while I typed this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a good cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone over all. I'm a bit disappointed at the battery life though. With light use the battery wouldn't last two days without recharging. Which honestly isn't terrible. But for a brand new phone I would have expected better and it's obvious not going to improve over time. Do love the camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone itself but the battery does not last very long when it's 100% and I'm not using it it will be down to like 92% when I go to use my phone and then it drops quickly when you make a phone call so I'm really disappointed with the battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the best cell phone that I have ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Can't beat the price for what you get with this phone! Love it!The camera is amazing, finger print reader is fine, and the speaker is loud. Fluent when browsing. Its like a corvette with world class performance at affordable price. Snapdragon 865, 6 gb ram, 4500 mah battery size, 6.5 inch screen with 120 hz display. Simply unbeatable for the price!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perhaps one of the best phones on the market at a decent price.Camera is spot on great face unlock and a great display i have owned a galaxy s10 plus and never utilized the quad HDThis phones battery will last much longer than an s20 because its bigger and its resolution is not hitting that 1440P.s its 120hz is addictive"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't found it easy to use but then I am not a nerd. I have only had it a couple of weeks."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded to S20 FE from a Moto G 3rd Gen and wow was i behind on technology. The reason why I upgraded because the Moto G only had a 4gb internal storage and couldn't get apps on the 32gb microSD, so my apps were limited. I really love this phone and I'm sure I'll have it for years to come."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works good like most Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This has actually been a really great phone for the price. It does everything you want it to do if you just hang around tik tok and take alot of pics."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received new Samsung. Have to adjust from apple. New learning curve."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Zero stars if possible. The phone microphone broke in 3 short months. Although still under warranty, Samsung will not fix it. The local repair shop Samsung directed me to does not have parts for this phone because it is so new. I called Samsung and asked them to send a microphone to the repair shop. Samsung refused. Samsung's only ""solution"" is to mail them the phone for two weeks so they can decide whether to fix or replace it. Not a workable solution for a self-employed person reliant on a mobile phone for business. After 10+ years of buying Samsung Galaxy phones, I am finished with them. Avoid at all costs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is everything it says it would be. The battery last almost 3 days with moderate use. The signal is almost always full bars everywhere I go. The stereo speakers on the phone are a big plus with gaming. The screen refresh rate on it is crazy good. Perfect smartphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 Overall good product but was disappointed because it came without earphones.
Made in Vietnam
Amazon customer care compensated me for the earphones separately!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE"," Overall good product but was disappointed because it came without earphones.
Made in Vietnam
Amazon customer care compensated me for the earphones separately!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got everything from my old phone transferred over and set up and noticed the case was separated at one corner so set up return for replacement. Now I have the replacement and Good phone! Great price! Love all the features but the Battery not so good. I can't get more that 12 hours of not very heavy use before I have to charge again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the phome but there is something wrong with sim 2. It isnt reading my other sim ,dont know if its just me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was overdue for an upgrade phone. I usually buy ones that have been out for a couple of years. But the unlocked price of this phone sparked my interest. Not many reviews yet, but so far I am pleased. I Use TracFone and have no regrets. You get the same service as you do with being a major network customer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought as a gift and it was so worth it great quality vibrant colors loud definitely would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was exactly what I thought it would. Great job Samsung. Way to use all the leftover parts of the flagship and create a more affordable phone. I didn't come from a flagship phone, so this is the best phone I bought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome smart phone, does it all and more. But I'm not able to use mobile data on 5G with t mobile. Haven't figure out if it's network or phone issue, neither t mobile or Samsung could help me fixing it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","By far the best phone we've ever had. Great photos. I doubt I'll ever figure out how to use it to it's full capabilities. Thanks Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good processing speed, no head phone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have nothing but great things to say about my new phone! It's beautiful, the screen is amazing and bright, and it does everything I need and more. Highly recommend if your looking for a mod priced phone. Love Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I opened the box and checked every detail of the phone and the accesories, there weren't the headphones and that was dissapointed because I review the description and what comes with the purchase, the headphones were part of the deal and didn't come, just the pack that comes the headphones but empty. The rest is OK, the port of the headphones is different is type C, so I can't used by old samsung headphones in the new model."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Happy w/the price.... Thought it was fair !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it all, the feek, the look, how fast it is and not having y o charge every few hrs! It's awesome. Just love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is sooooooo BIG! Likens to Get Smarts shoe phone. I have a tablet and I wanted a phone. This is too big for my hand, my pocket, my purse-- it is just too big. Returned the phone and waiting for my refund. I've decided on a Z Flip. Please, please, please make small phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good phone...loved it..the only thing I didn't liked is that the front camera is on the screen..which interferes and is a little distraction and it does not look good on the screen..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrading from an S8 and disappointed to see the multifunction rgb led is discontinued, it lacks a blood O2 and pulse sensor, it's significantly bigger screen and weight. But this is the closest I could find with micro SD and a decent processor that's also 5G. My S8 lasted a solid 4 years I just don't see this one doing the same."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nope. I bought it a couple months ago and it randomly just decided to never turn on again. The phone was very well taken care of. No cracks , no water damage, nothing. Yet it just stopped working. What a waste of money. üò°"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've ever owned. I see a lot of people mentioning they have toch screen issues so if u don't know, when u first get the phone there is a thin layer plastic u have to peel off which if u don't may affect the touch. Other than that this really is a good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","HAD IT FOR ABOUT 22 DAYS & STOPPED WORKING. BUGGY PHONE - I DON, T KNOW. I HAD TO RETURN IT."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone isnt that great for playing video games, the screen not fast responsive. But For the most part it works great.! I liked it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have used a Samsung S6 Active for years but I finally purchased a new phone. I really miss the ease of shutting down or restarting the phone. You should never have to watch a video to find out how to do this simple task but it is a requirement here. Even then I forget and have to go out and search the net on how to do it again, again... Otherwise, it is a OK phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is running fast and has all good features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Another great android phone. Purchased during prime day - def worth the money. (previous phone was 5+ years old). Love that it doesn't come loaded with a bunch of service providers apps that are uncessary."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge beautiful screen, amazing sound with the Dolby atmos... all day long and still have battery. My eyes are bleeding and arms burning with the pains of a thousand bee stings...will never let go....jack..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Use for gift"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I hardly get less than a day of usage with sporadic video feeds and browsing. Considering these phones have to be replaced when the battery dies, the planned obsolescence is almost blatant."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like the S20 FE phone. I upgraded from a much older phone. It was a much needed upgrade. Everything runs much smoother. Battery life is better. Storage space is better. Camera is awesome! I LOVE it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was just advise by a repair shop that repaired a broke screen for me, that this phone did not have a 5g antenna but a 4. False advertising!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say, if you looking for a phone to last and with all the newest technology that the 1000 dollar phone have, then this is the one. It does everything great and for the price it's amazing. I picked it up for 550 brand new and I'm Happy with my purchase samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's OK, feels pretty midrange though, might as well get the Samsung A51 or A71. Battery drains a lot faster than on my iphone 11. You can get a full day if usage isn't heavy. Performance is really good, but other things like camera, screen speakers, etc...now a total wow."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had it for just over a year. It was nothing special for the high cost. Started dying all the time. It would be at like 67o/o and then just die. So I sent it to Samsung so they could figure out what's wrong. They informed me that the motherboard went bad and since I was about a month and a half past the yrs warranty it would cost me $366 to fix it. Can't afford it so they sent it back. It was a very expensive phone but I bought it cuz it was supposed to be the best. Never again! Very disappointed with Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to finally get a decent phone and I was looking into this one because I really care about the camera quality. According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It's been a while since I've paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn't take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn't able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also, I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn't work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work, but other times it wouldn't. I spoke to a Amazon Tech, I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone, clear the data, the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn't working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works. It might just be a defective phone, but not satisfied especially since I had bought all the protection for this phone ahead of time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why ais this phone so dumb?

In the 10+ years of the expansion of smartphone technology, why do I suddenly have to care to write a post about how poor my experience of this smartphone is; within a week of purchasing it? Because it's dumb. It's almost patronizing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone can your budget phone if you're not looking to speed thousand into high end. It can goes up against Oneplus 8T and Pixel 5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is such a large upgrade from my old phone. The screen resolution, faster processing and the ability to is 5g has been such a game changer. The phone is super fast, it's reliable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it, however, it is VERY hard to find cases for it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Viewing videos on the large sceeen is wonderful and the video quality is exceptional. The camera is amazing. This
phone is just the right size for one-handed manipulation and pack with features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint recognition is great, facial recognition is lighting fast. The batter lasts all day and then some. When on the internet there is no lag with surfing and / or watching netflix on the device. I use the hotspot alot and no issues there. I would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I replaced my Galaxy J7 with this phone and the upgrade was huge! It runs so much faster and smoother, and I can actually take decent pictures now. All I had to do was move the T-Mobile chip over from my old phone. Well worth the purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone isn't that bad, however I'm not giving it 5 stars because of 2 main reasons. 1) The battery life isn't as good as some people would claim in my opinion. And 2) every since it receive an software update, part of my screen would just stop working every so often and my home button also won't work for a period of time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone SPECIFICALLY for the DUAL SIM CARD functionality. Its very hard to get a factory unlocked dual sim-card phone in the USA for warranty issues. SAMSUNG announced in the press the S21FE5G would be the first, starting in January 2022. As of May 2022, SAMSUNG has not unlocked this functionality.....and the website has removed references to the Dual Sim-Card. Contacting Samsung support reveals they are still working on it, but OS update date is still unknown, and they will not estimate timing.

As a stand-alone phones, is surprisingly poor. I agree with most of the other technically oriented reviews. Processor is clunky. Screen isn't great. Finger and facial recognition are unreliable. ANDROID OS not happy on this platform.

I CAN NOT recommend this phone. ANOTHER Samsung fail!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is totally unlocked and works with gsm card of differents counries(USA and Argentina, for instance). Also works great and the cameras are excelents, also the screen is crystal clear. I think this phone is a bang for the buck! The transition from from my old S9 was without any glitch."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Oh my gosh do I love this phone, this is a replacement for my old Galaxy S8+. This one is for sure superior. Great sound quality, significantly louder than the S8+. The pictures are just amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung's ‚ÄúPrivacy Police‚Äù and ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù are striking: demand unconditional permission to collect all sorts of your personal information directly and indirectly and to create a profile with stunning visual audio text details that they would sell to anyone willing to pay for it, including ‚Äúprofessional services organizations, such as auditors and law firms‚Äù. ""Law Firms""? What that means!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved the looks of this phone. In just under 6 weeks after the 90 day warranty expired the phone had problems. I took it to a professional who was able to diagnose a hard ware problem. I tried dealing with the seller and they washed their hands of me because it was beyond the warranty. I was out over $400! I talked with Amazon and they made good on it - except that I sent it back a week ago and haven't received confirmation yet! No money back and now I'm out the cash for another new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love some of the features and some I don't. But the phone so far has worked well. Having trouble finding otterbox defender case for it. The battery life is better than any other phone I have had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for 2 days, and I'm very disappointed that the battery drains really fast. I had my previous Samsung phone for many years, and the battery lasted from early morning to late at night, with plenty of power remaining at day's end. I would think that this new ""5G"" phone would be better in all respects - especially a crucial function like battery life - than my old ""3G"" phone. I'm not sure if I want to keep this phone, or send it back as ""defective. """
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I would recommend to anyone to buy this phone I come from iPhone XS and I don‚Äôt regret at all switching, the S20 FE has so many cool features that you‚Äôll love, also for the price you get high end phone specs, this must be the best 2020 phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Half the price of a similar Verizon phone, perfectly compatible, does everything I need and has plenty of RAM and storage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone I got is defective. I reported it to their techs and after they couldn't find a fix, they shamelessly tried a trade in on me at a predatory rate. Longtime Samsung customer, this is my last Samsung device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Decided on a Note 10 instead so I returned it which took FOREVER!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a S8 and was not going to spend 1000.00 on a new phone. I saw this phone during prime days and knew I had to get it. I have been pleased every since."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is the best, very fast processor. One of the best phone I ever had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i got the white color and bought the black case for it; also the glass screen protector for the front and the rear cameras.i see people complaing about the mistake that it was posted about being 8gb of ram.im just happy that i got it for 100$ off: thank God!thanks!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it so far uts to early yet .will see how it goes but I love the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very disappointing, after several calls to Amazon in trying to bypass the pattern code it keeps asking as the phone appears to be sync to prior owner. They had me call Samsung and Samsung referred me back to Amazon for them to fix the issue. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money The only solution from Amazon was for me to return the phone and get my money back as they do not any more phones to offer me at the great price it was."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","2 months buying this new S20 FE 5 G it became useless and won't work anymore for mobile communication. After 2/22 , 3G towers are being shut down and depending on exact IEMI # of phone won't be able to connect to service (doesn't go on model # and some older models will work like my wife's Galaxy S10 which is fine). Amazon is selling phones with discontinued and unserviceable technology and I was warned not to buy from places like Amazon by my service provider. Now I'm told after I wasted my money and only got a 2 month usage out of it. Not good Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am loving my new phone. It takes a little time trying to get used to the new phone. The battery life is wonderful compared to my galaxy 7 phone. I can not get the fingerprint reader to work for me. I'm trying the face recognition now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I 've been trying to resolve problems (i.e. still can't access my voice mail) with Verizon, my server.. It has been a nightmare and under terrible conditions since I,ve been experiencing medical problems at the same time and I was unable to to receive important calls that went directly into my voice mail.Could this possibly be a malfunction with the phone?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","NOT a dual sim, as advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had this phone for about 2 months now and nothing but happy! Has good speed on our wireless network, clear calls, better photos than I ever expected from a phone!Not even a little regretful about this purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge battery life and so much faster than my old note 5. Yes I had my old phone since 2014."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It doesn't have audio aux jack 3.5mm output! Be aware of it and think if you like to play with adapters!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera is fantastic! Many settings. Exceptional pictures. Love all the memory. You can't go wrong with 1Terrabite with a sim card. Plus the memory of the phone. The phone was perfect. Brand new. Came quick and easy set up. Very pleased!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","hasn't triedall features yet surprised no slot for sd card Otherwise, do far, happy with phone and additional storage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery dead and will not charge"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was what I needed plus more, amazing display and battery life and the phone itself looks amazing. Delivery cam6 days earlier than expected which is a great bonus. Would recommend this phone to anyone as it is the best phone at its price point"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So did you buy this during prime days? The deal was amazing.Either way this FE model I have absolutely come to enjoy. The right size for your hands and good features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is THE phone people should buy if they're trying to get the best bang for their buck. You're essentially getting flagship specs in a phone that is 200-300 dollars cheaper than the more expensive flagship. If you're looking for a phone right now, you should really consider this one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Within two months the rear camera 1x started having issues and was no longer able to focus. Pictures were blurry."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am so delighted with my Samsung s20 android phone. The camera is awesome and allows me to take pictures 30x and still get amazing quality photos and videos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the finger print reader üòçMy last phone was a Samsung Note 3, I had it until I had to get a new phone because Sprint went 5G. I hope this phone will be as good..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super fast, awesome features.....I only disliked having the headaches of transferring contents from my old S7 to this phone. Otherwise üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well I like the phone but battery üîã is draining quickly then usually and heats up quickly while I put it on charge and takes good pictures during the day and night it especially when it is night mode.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased last year. At first this was a great phone. Great battery life. Had a problem with constantly restarting which was eventually fixed by a software update. I upgraded my AT&T service to 5g. Didn't work so I went to an AT&T store to fix. They said it's the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone! Been using it for a month now it works perfect with my knock off carrier total wireless.. I have a car, screen protector, camera glass protector. It's going to last me a long while."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone carrier has not supported this IMEI model, thus far. The phone is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from a Samsung 7. What a difference---this phone/ computer is really fast. Love the 5g. This is a really large phone so handle one first."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved my previous Galaxy S8, but since the battery can't be replaced, multiple charges were necessary every day. The FE S20 is blazingly faster, and 1 charge is good for 24 hours plus. A best buy rating from Consumer Reports sealed it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works like it should. Like the big screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its a really pleasant looking phone, the camera is pretty good, I've gotten some really nice pictures out of it but it's kinda a pain in my @ss. The screen is super touchy and it'll think I'm touching something when my hands aren't even on it. The battery life is solid and the call quality is nice. I don't think it's worth 600$ and honestly I preffered my old galaxy j7 but unfortunately it broke and the only thing I could do was upgrade. Overall it's a decent phone, works fine, just a bit annoying and not very friendly for non tech savvy people."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is going well, it came sealed, in perfect shape very pleased so far. It was a gift, mom very happy as well with her birthday present."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a very sophisticated phone that makes more expensive phones look just as equal and this is by far just as good as an s21 in my own opinion"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","But cannot uninstall stock apps and does not include the headset. Amazon will not acknowledge it or the false advertising.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am liking my time with this phone so far. The only problem is that the fingerprint reader sometimes has trouble recognizing my prints."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung seems to have a corporate mission statement and philosophy: if it works, update it and make sure it doesn't! Our first Samsung phones were great and now they are just another pain in the A.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item arrived with 2 cracks on the screen product was advertised as used but no mention of any cracks on the main screen or phone itself not happy plus phone don't hold charge for 8 full hours have to charge in between"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is awesome I been a samsung fan since the galaxy s3. My one huge problem is the selfish camera. It's so awful. Why does it look so blurry I feel like I don't have my glasses on when I use it, please fix this as I myself am a huge selfie person."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Extremely user friendly love the fingerprint reader and the battery life the phone lasts more than one day before I have to charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","look like old product & warranty only six months. website mentioned new one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone seems nice when you just got it...but a few months later the problem starts like ...freezing up not recognizing the touch and shutdown ever so often."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quite an upgrade from my 5 year old HTC. Nice display, good storage, big screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't used face recognition, the fingerprint scan stopped working. Other than this love this little phone & it takes great pics so far. Was worth the money for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a Galaxy S8 and this was so incredibly easy and quick to wirelessly transfer my contacts files and photos over to the S20 FE. No scratches or dents, brand new. Camera seems decent. So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far! The technological differences can be seen in comparison to my old S8+. The Samsung S20 FE is way faster, the cameras are way better, and it looks way cleaner.Crazy how affordable this phone is for what you get from it. Definitely would recommend!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered a new phone but the phone arrived with a sticky dirty screen and USB cord opened. I returned it right away. Because the phone doesn't appear to be new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone! I use it all day long. Great display! Great sound! It has 2 speakers.Nice & fast! I look forward to using it for 5 years because it is so good!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far, this smartphone is performing very well, camera is very good, and battery is great. Under normal use, it can easily last two days. And it works internationally with any carrier (I'm using it in Europe)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Aside from the dodgy screen issues, the phone runs great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For it's price, this phone is ridiculously good. It's battery life and durability is rated higher than this year's iphones. And Samsung has seemed to improve their interface as well which was needed. Just an overall great phone cost aside."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The best Android phone that I ever had. Samsung S20 fe phone rivals the iPhone 12. I'm done with IPhones. The battery last all day to night time. Very responsive and more features than I expected. Great budget phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worth the money! Superb performance. The high refresh rate really gives a smooth feeling. The audio and video are great too. The fingerprint reader is not so fast and doesn't work sometimes when it gets a little wet but not like it is inconvenient!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good phone, but do NOT buy if you're expecting this to be dual-sim: Samsung bricks up the 2nd sim slot in the US so only one sim can be used with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life has been incredible so far. No dropped calls and no other problems. I am very pleased with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone arrived with a hairline crack on the screen. It was returned back and a refund was received. Samsung phones are reported to have a weak signal. Samsung will blame it on the carrier and carrier will blame it on the manufacturer. I recommend that every smartphone buyer research the signal strength of the phone before purchasing it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung G20FE 5G is a great phone for the price, great pics, expandable memory and fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is suppose to be a brand new phone, but the one I received appears to have something dirtyalong one corner of the phone. All other parts look fine. Functions are fine so far.Will monitor the phone. It is disgrace for Amazon and Samsung to sell used phone as new!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is like new even though I buy it as used but the only complaint I have is the box and the phone was full of hair. Like that was weird"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a great computer that fits in your hands and even makes phone calls!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Long battery life, great pictures, love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","LOVE IT üíò"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This American version of this phone does not support a dual sim. I am not sure why phone manufacturers think Americans do not want a dual sim capability, but I have two phone numbers and I want them in the same phone. I sent it back. Otherwise its a very nice phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall good phone. Very fast, all the functions of a flagship. I don't know if it's just my phone, but battery life to me is lacking."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've by chance had a total of three of these in my family, so have a decent handle on them. For the specs on paper, it seems a good deal. But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent. One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone. Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues. Just Google it. All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts. The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying. I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. The pics are great, it's fast, easy to navigate, and pretty, mine is pinkish purple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worked amazing the first 2 days, after that the battery life has gotten worse and worse. After a year, battery life is ridiculous. Have to charge it 2, 3 times a day.The storage space is fantastic.By ""lavender"" they actually mean pink."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone to replace my Galaxy S9. It was great for two weeks, but suddenly the screen started acting like a magnet stuck to a CRT television. Resetting the phone did not help and shutting it down and turning it back on only works for a few minutes before it returns to the glitchy screen. I plan on getting a replacement, but I can't rate it higher than two stars at the moment. I probably got a bad phone but I didn't drop it and it is in a very heavy duty case so I don't know what happened to cause this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall a good upgrade from my galaxy 8+ hope too use this one for 4 years before i upgrade again lol"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered another issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work. We are downto one star because this is not something I am ok with."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No complain except battery do not work long"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone lag on the touch screen, also run slow. My note 9 was faster and the functionality was better. On a good note super cute color and camera takes decent pictures"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was super happy with it, was super easy to put in my SIM card and SD Card and get it all set-up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the BoxI return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the Box"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the facial recognition. Lots of memory so I no longer have to delete apps to get new apps!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 Once I started messing wirh my phone after charging then finally turning on the screen started glitching and having lines go through it. The phone itself looked absolute beautiful."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like that it takes an SD card and it comes in nice colors. The camera is exceptionally good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We bought Two of these and we could not be any happier with them. The Price is the Best I found and the Trade-In Value was also the Most of any of the others that I found."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Since getting banned from Twitter I don't use it a lot anyone but it's still a great phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lovely phone... really have no complaint so far. Been using since December 2020. Phone is super fast... no lags while playing games like PUBG... very powerful camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works really well with lots of programs and apps, as well as being pretty fluid as far as processing goes."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was mostly interested in the camera, and it works well. I am coming from an iPhone 6, so of course everything on the S20 FE is beyond better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So the phone worked fine till I got the update on July 3rd...After that the phone though I was in a different state/timezone, then all incoming calls went straight to voice mail.Samsung sent me to an authorized repair center where I was told the region of the phone was Denmark.They only have the US software and could not help me at this point.Lucky Amazon took it back after 37 days...Definitely says US version in the description"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the box the phone came in was very dirty, and when I opened the box the phone was very dusty. cleaned everything with lysol wipes. Other then that the phone itself is great! The screen, camera, and battery life are really good. works with my samsung watch 3. Since it is a Samsung phone I figured it would work with my Samsung gear 360 camera, my samsung s9 works perfectly with it. Unfortunately the 360 camera app is not compatible with this phone and will not connect to the camera. Just wanted to give a heads up for anyone that has this camera, I did not see anyone mention this issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the device. Battery life is a little iffy and there is a deep scratch on screen that wasn't mentioned but overall great condition. I am satisfied"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Communication and information"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from the S10+ this phone is amazing for the price...the finger print scanner works flawlessly battery life lasts me all day and face recognition is on point 5 stars!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just purchased this Samsung S-20 FE 5G and love it! The price compared to all the other S-20's ...well, I couldn't justify spending an additional hundred bucks for a slight upgrade.Kind regards,Techie"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Slowest phone I have ever had. I HATE IT! I wish I didn't give my grandson my s10 because I would be using that now instead of constantly waiting for things to load. Don't buy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn't show any sign of beeing used, and that surprised me, great phone for the price, the delivery was on time and well packaged."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It should be noted that it won't work without sim card!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","got it I only get new phones in 3-4 yrs as I'm not ready to move data from one phone to another.google pixel to samsung worked for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. It goes from 100% down to 80% within 2 hours. Just regular use, just texting and looking at emails."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great, powerful phone with fantastic features and case color is beautiful! Very happy with this! Touchscreen sensitivity is a little off, when using a screen protector though, even with sensitivity settings activated."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Long battery life. Does more than I will ever figure out how to use. Awesome camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great step up from the several levels of steps that are little better than a $200 phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung lover! Great phone ordered for the family"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone! It has all the features I need and want. I love being able to use a video for a screensaver."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I mean I'm no expert but it's a significant upgrade from my relic I had.Also dropped it in the toilet and it had no damage so thumbs-up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Charging port stopped working the same day return window ends (1 month). My old S6 has endured a thousand more drops than this S20 FE, but its charging port still works after 6 years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Randomly restarts, Googled it & it's not uncommonSamsung says no know issues & wants me to send it in for repairs.Kinda funny if they don't know about."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge upgrade for me. I love it, besides the no headphone port."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been using one since February. So, got one for my wife. She loves it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I came back to Samsung after couple of years with LG and so far I am happy. The battery life and cameras are terrific. Everything else works great as well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Has a great camera, and the wife loves it. Hence I am happy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the battery is awesome and the camera is impressive. Make sure you note that it is an S20 fe model when looking for a protective case as the ones for the S20 won't fit."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was so easy to transfer from my s9. I would recommend it for the lower price point, than the s21"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this nifty phone. Great that I purchased on Prime day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great product dont forget to change the setting to sensitive finger print reader if you have a glass case. Great phone my fiancee love it, its fast and it charges other phone if needed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty good phone, I like the fingerprint reader. A good upgrade from my J8, but the battery life could be better."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is overall good. What I can say about the phone in a word that is I am satisfied with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone...no complaints! Takes wonderful pictures too. Fingerprint entry is always quick! I love this phone!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Seriously, shipping a $600 item in a cardbox box 3 times larger than original box, with little filler.The original box shifts and rattles within the shipping box. Remains to be seen if the product itself is undamagedThis is on you Amazon, nothing to do with the manufacturer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint sensor works, the stereo speakers are awesome. I got the cloud white, love it. The amoled screen is beautiful. Phone is fast at everything it does. Great investment, you will not be disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update on my phone. It stumped the ""rescue"" crew and Samsung (the phone worked great until the update at the end of June... then nothing). Samsung came through and replaced my brand new phone... now we see how this one does on the next update. I'm giving them a cautious three stars for doing the right thing.Well, guess what? The update fried my new phone... back to square zero... Samsung is back to one star. Patience..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am just getting used to it. Love the fingerprint reader, fabulous! Face recognition I will have to play with , till I figure it out."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","had an issue with samsung keyboard, ended up using third party keyboard"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do research before buying this product. This phone has so many operating system problems that it is almost not functional."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because it seemed like a good alternative to the more expensive Samsung phones like the S21 or Note 20. I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket, nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support, after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone. I have a Pixel now and would never go back to Samsung. This phone is poorly designed and breaks easily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband loved his new phone! Great price and awesome battery life! Thank you so much for a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I like most, it a quality device and factory unlocked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just do it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Since I bought this phone the speakers has not been working properly and I tried Device Care and it was no help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is fantastic for the price I was able to get it at. The battery life is also excellent."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband bought me this phone and I absolutely love it. I am still learning new features daily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your looking for a good mid price range flagship phone, I highly recommend the s20 fe excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfect case. It secures the phone front and back. Easy to take case off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is making me give up the flagship options. Affordable, great camera, decent battery life (and charges quickly, too), and has a great refresh rate (quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is exactly what I needed . Lots of features and it lasts a long time"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure why box was missing headsets."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't had any issues with my phone. Love it, thank you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I ever had. Flagship specs I got it on black Friday. Good price $549. Wait for a discount."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I RECEIVED THE CELLPHONE WITHOUT CHARGER. PLEASE SEND IT TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do not buy. Had the phone for 4 months sim card reader malfunctioned sent in for repair twice. sent back by Samsung the 2nd time unrepaired according to repair paperwork from Samsung. I now have a $700.00 paper weight."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like this phone. It is fast, the screen is gorgeous and 120 hz makes scrolling smooth. It has most of the s20 flagship features but at a more reasonable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone keeps on overheating and shutting down. Samsung customer service refuses to replace it. If you want a product with customer support, look elsehwere."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great company to do business with! Real products and great customer service!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not ready for prime time yet. Has a lot of features but they don't work the way they should. Just traded it in for the S21 ulta 5g. This is the refined model. Works good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got the phone like brand new condition and was very happy to hold in my hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 Most all features up until Late September worked just fine. Then the screen flickering and going blank. I tried all restarts, clear cache, factory reset, nothing got rid of it. My last Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE"," Most all features up until Late September worked just fine. Then the screen flickering and going blank. I tried all restarts, clear cache, factory reset, nothing got rid of it. My last Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is great but no charger......just another expence..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.

It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.

Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Feels solid, scratch resistant, Comes with nice lanyard for phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I very like Samsung S series"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I don't like the fingerprint thing on the front and I don't like all the buttons on one side"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast, perfect, amazing camera and device overall. Exceptional value."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","See the above"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is very poor. The screen looks tired if you use it at night. And another thing is that the repair cost is too high. My friend spend $300 to repair its screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got a great deal when I bought it. It's awesome. Features are great battery life is awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i like this phone so much.it is pretty worth its money.the screen is fantastic ,much better than my previous iphoneX"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing Samsung phone. More features than they advertised. Samsung gave up the house in this phone. The Camera is beyond bad a**."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is a little too big to handle but the One UI takes care of that, gives you a one-hand mode. Love love the cameras."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone!
A big step up from the galaxy s6!
Sound quality is good, photo quality is very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am unable to get 5g forever so what's point getting a 5g phone!, as I found out nothing. could not even pick up 4g service with It, so mad after wasting time in Verizon store packed all the time and useless tech support, returned it. I will say it has the best camera in a phone ever seen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera works great and I love the color. Great speed even on 4g lite.
So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","phone works great so far and camera wins with the zoom... smooth transition from app to app and most videos r picture in picture so thats good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone does not work on T- Mobiles 5G. Not sure about other carriers."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this for my parents to replace the old Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all, the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all, the display has worse color uniformity, you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken, the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The finger print and face identifiers are great but not 100% and of course masks don't help. Battery life seems to be great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really liked the phone itself and would have loved to have kept it but the battery was absolutely terrible. I don't even know how they are allowed to sell this phone. The phone would die about mid day and that was with the power saving mode on and location off. The phone would also get very hot for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easy to set up and works with Verizon.
Love it!
I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought it February 2022. Currently July 2022! Have to purchase a new phone because this phone is the biggest piece of garbage ever. Unlocked for 4 months. Now there‚Äôs nothing but problems with it. It currently works with Wi-Fi only. No service. Have had it looked at numerous times and they can‚Äôt do anything. Biggest lie ever. Do not purchase. If I could give it 0 stars I would."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had this phone for 2 months! I cannot use the camera anymore and I get ""Warning: Camera Failed""! I tried every trick and reset and nothing worked! I had Sumsung Tech connect to my phone and they couldn't fix it. Simply put Samsung knows there is an issue and are reluctant to make it public. I am a very light user and very knowledgeable user and based on all sites I found where users are posting the exact similar issue, I wish I knew before buying this worthless phone but will never buy another Samsung product again. This was quickly baked and released to the market to make $$$$. No accountability Samsung! None! Please release a fix immediately or offer to exchange these clunkers that are less than 3 months old! Before you buy just google Warning Camera Failed....100's of new owners posted the issue. I also posted on Samsung's community web site. And, Samsung never called me back after not being able to fix it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Returning my Samsung s20 FE 5g.
Maybe I just got lemon, but my phone got frozen screen 5,6 times in first two weeks and than reboots, not acceptable for new phone and 6gig ram. Also fingerprint reader is horrible, face unlock works good though.
Battery life not what expected for 4500mh.
Touchscreen is not always responsive, especially on the corners of the screen.
Thing that I liked is great display/resolution.
I would stay away from this phone, on paper everything seems amazing, in reality too many issues."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was very wary of purchasing a phone off of Amazon, but this is the real deal. Came in original box with charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works perfectly. Theres really no significant difference between this and one of the more expensive flagship versions of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it great price. Got it on prime day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really good like new I love this phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The day we rec'd this phone we took it to an AT&T store for the SIM card. The card would not fit. My daughter was so upset and this was her birthday gift so it upset me too. While all the features of this phone is what brought us to this phone I will say that all of her information transferred smoothly with the Samsung app, but without the SIM card working, we had no service. Phone had to be returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Exceeded my expectations - great speed for unloading and downloading, excellent battery life so far, and great look."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love üíò my knew phone ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent smart phone. User friendly, functionable, stylish, right size."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this phone for my husband and then when it came we went to metro to turn the phone on.. but the problem is they put the card and everything and when you try to make a call it doesn't work it keeps saying no simcard he did everything to make the phone work but nothing happened.. it says its factory unlocked when i ordered.. so i returned it on 21st of last month and i just want a refund but still didn't got it it's been two weeks.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This unlocked phone has so many bugs! The touch screen is unresponsive 30% of the time. The phone will freeze for no apparent reason. The internet gets dropped no matter if you're on 5G, LTE, 4G, 3G or 2G.

Besides all that, if you want a sleek and slim phone case with a kickstand, we'll tie gonna have to wait because they don't exist. Only the big, bulky brick in your pocket case with kickstands exists at the moment.

Bottom line... This phone was put out on the market before everything was ready."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the big battery level"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","They call it the best android phone of 2020. I haven't found a reason to argue with that."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My first expensive phone!
Very nice. Lots of memory space. Super fastüòä‚ù§"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Am hooked on Samsung phones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't waste your money on this. Phone has had nothing but problems since I got it. Can't use gamepass, keeps asking for me to sign into Samsung account constantly, and refuses to recognize the sims card sometimes making it impossible to send calls or texts. All that money down the drain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is awesome. Easy to navigate."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything great. Battery above avg."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its a great flagship budget phone!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great deal for the phone. Didn't want to pay 1000 for a phone so this was a nice deal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My mother is very happy with this product, pictures and video are stunning"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone wasn't good battery life is awful...my old phone battery is strong than it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I took the clear plastic off of the front screen protector it had some dust on it and when I tried to clean it the finger print circle got some dust on it and I tried to fix it but that only made it worse. I think there should be something in the instructions that says whatever you do don't touch that spot. Now I have to send it back and my phone will be unprotected until the new case comes."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my new phone and it has fully met my expectations and was worth the wait."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone came used/ no charger/ I took 6 hours trying to set up/ never go it/ I tried resetting and starting it twice/ I didn‚Äôt want to send back / it wouldn‚Äôt let me text out/ and a butch of other problems so I had to give up at 2:00 am and send it back"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone . Absolutely no complaints at Ll"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it. Would recommend for a good reasonably samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life could be better but honestly, this phone is a flagship for half the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All around, worst ot S series.....Been a consumer since S3. Went from Note 8 to a disfunctional S21+.S21 is terrible for phone reception....(5g)....drops calls when walking with wifi calling...dont trade in or replace a phone that works with one that doesnt. Btw, the camera is the only part that functions quite well....but not enough to overcome other issues"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Keeps restarting and going in and out of service working"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone . Bought a 2nd one for my wife ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","SO far so good....looking forward to taking pictures to compare the quality with the Samsung 8"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","how should I connect headphones to this weird device? why there is no a regular slot for headphones and no adapter? i'm buying S20 FE in July 2022 because the next galaxy generation doesn't have a slot for external storage! this is degradation....what is going on?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone switched from an iphone and in my opinion this phone takes the win!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not the best phone but for the price is the best option."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I order a new phone and they sent me a used phone ,too hot to touch when charged, also full of virus too bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast, large and stylish...a superb phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","everything i need and more"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone worked well initially. Within about a month, however, touchscreen began to malfunction, leading to long periods of little or no functionality. The screen would become glitchy, become covered in static, and freeze. It would then take awhile for any form of functionality to return."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A quality phone with good battery life, an excellent camera, and many polished features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loving my new battery life! Amazing camera and worth the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a nice phone I just hate that it doesn't have an auxiliary port"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about the phone is great for the most part. However, the phone has problems charging after I purchased a fast charging cable which oddly enough, isn't even listed on Amazon anymore. I plugged it in once and now the phone has problems charging even with the cable included with the phone. Very disappointing that I need to struggle just to get it to charge."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not gotten my phone set up yet"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My son really enjoys this phone and has so may features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has aind of it own. It texts and sends messages as it wants."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It hasn‚Äôt even been a year, it says ‚Äú unable to send message message blocking is active‚Äù everytime I try to text or doesn‚Äôt allow incoming calls. I bought it for my aunt who is older & that is very dangerous."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Product came with stickers only on thr bottom side. On top of that, the stickers were slashed open. This brings me to believe that the phone itself was tampered in some way, or a used/refurbished product. This is quite upsetting, considering we were expected a completely new and unused product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Using a note 9, then got this s20FE for a work phone. So many features missing, can't deep press screen to wake up phone, there is no fingerprint scanner, face recognition doesn't work well. The camera is too low so when you install a screen protector its within a small circle that fills with dust very easily. The rear camera lense stick way out of the phone requiring you to buy a separate protector for the back. When a slim phone case is on its nearly flush with the rear lense/glass.There are a lot less options for cases, went with same brand of case and they didn't even give it a back stand either.This phone is one worth skipping over, definitely not worth more than $250..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent purchase. I‚Äôm in love of it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its really strong... the sensor works on the first try."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It a great budget phone. You get more than wat you paid for."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Spend 500 and dont even recieve a charger, headphones or a tool to insert the sim? Absolutely disgusting. I could care less how the phone functions, the bare bones I recieved is nothing short of bs. Go to a store and buy a phone knowing you'll receive all the bells and whistles."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone everything seems perfect the battery could be a bit longer lasting."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","üíò it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is disappointing. The camera is the only good feature (which is truly awesome BTW). The phone has many glitches. It doesn't always stay connected to the WiFi in standby mode, it will just give me a blank screen sometimes and need to be restarted, and MMS sometimes won't go through without restarting the phone. These are the issues I've had in the first month. I've also even killed the battery a few days. I had decided to return it, but just missed the cut off. What a joke of a phone!This is my 5th or 6th Samsung Galaxy, and the 1st one that has not been worth it. I will not be purchasing another Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Power button fell off and 5g not working like it was in the beginning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you're thinking about it just get it!! You won't regret it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm still learning how to use all the features with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","phone is discounted for price and quality.I have this phone almost for two months now, having a lot of issues on the screen.Never had fingerprint reading issues including old versions of galaxy phones. Screen is garbage.if you use drawing app you will see screen misses lots of touching points when you are drawing something. Also it registers lines which you didn't make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent value, would buy again!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's exactly what I was looking for!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone great price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worth the price and works perfectly fineüëç."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Diffentely worth the money and excellent phone to upgrade to highly recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved my phone just what I wanted ‚ù§"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it a lot"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is garbage I don't even use it. Battery life was extremely limited. I thought there was Spyware in the phone because the battery drained so fast. It was glitch, slow, frozen, functioned like it was infected with a virus (and it was not). I had to factory reset it literally once a month and ended up only adding essential contacts, it still wouldn't work smoothly. I ended up digging out my old Note9 and use it. Even with its cracked body and age, it works a million times better! Do not buy this phone, you will regret it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Camera is great for price, runs games well. The stock software on this is a bit bloaty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good and easy to use"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been buying Samsung phones for over 10 years. This one is terrible.... way too big...I jab be large hands and need 2 to hold it... will not fit in your pocket. Very heavy, battery lasts 1.5 days brand new out of the box. The camera that was raved about is only slightly better than my old s7."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is no good, no charger , no headphones jack, it brings a useless type c cord."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","still setting up the phone ""my way"", but all seems really nice so far...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wonderful phone. I really like it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone of the year considering what it offers for the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great size. Everything seems to run smoothly and fast. Also takes great pictures!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone !! The lavender is so pretty!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the bling"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This product is NOT new. It is refurbished. Serial Number begins with RF and IMEI SV is 26. I bought this under the impression that it is factory unlocked and brand new. It feels awful being misled. I cannot even return it because it is past the return date."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very smart purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone, it wasGood, but 15 mins into use & the phone got very hot, just doesnt feel right!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not nearly enough packaging, I'm very surprised the phone made it here in 1 piece"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like the phone. HATE that Bixby is tied to the power button."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung hasn't let me down."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unstable data connection with Tmobile!5G barely works in Chicago.I have a a52 5g as a second phone, and it gets way better data connection!Other than that, it's perfectly fine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Seriously no charger? My old phone did not have a fast charging adapter. It takes 4 hours to charge this phone on that. I thought this was a premium phone? Now I have to pay more for a fast charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this phone is not good. I definitely should have spent the extra money for the regular s20 or waited for the s21. the phone is slow, it glitches all the time. the camera is terrible and freezes and shuts down a lot. my last phone was the galaxy s8 and i feel like this phone is a bit of a down grade from that one... don't buy it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone was just as described!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this 5g phone. Super fast and easy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung has put in apps that I am unable to remove and they are difficult to turn off. It seems Samsung is insistent on collecting all my data!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As described...the phone is like new condition"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was locked when it said it was unlocked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone all of a sudden stopped recognizing the sim that was in my phone after working perfectly fine for 8 months. You can't get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it. I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired. Dealing with Samsung supports has been awful. I also purchased the 2 year protection plan that's a joke because they wont help till the manufacture warranty is expired. what a night mare. HEY SELLER get the the IMEI numbers on the invoice/receipt so we can get the device fixed if it breaks for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great! As expected!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything works as it should. Fast delivery."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really a great phone! Love it!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone, excellent battery life, very fast and easy to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really liked this phone at first. It was somewhat too large but had lots of very nice features. Then, after owning it 3-weeks, bad things started to happen. During calls the screen would keep going dark after 10-sec. I contacted Samsung and the tech could do nothing to fix this issue. He said they were working on it and needed to re-included an app that they removed but had no alternative. Then, the answer and hang-up buttons stopped working completely and the phone wouldn't shut off. Finally I had enough of this not-ready-for primetime piece of nonsense made by Samsung - a company that I had always respected. Fortunately I was able to return the phone through Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Android phones use to be easy to use and navigate, this has way to much samsung proprietary software that is not at all intuitive. No back button, u have to swipe. Complicated for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item is being sold as new but is used and abused."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone! Fingerprint reader better than expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was missing in the box."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am So angry when I received the phone, USB C input on the phone was already worn down to the point where I had a wiggle my charger in to get it righto get it right and the battery life never lasted more than 5 to 6 hours.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We like it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Interesting device, simple design, good camera especially in good lighting conditions, but battery life is not good enough ..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best value with flagship specs. Absolutely in love with this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bluetooth don't work will not sync. Voice command is retarded, it will some times make the correct words and then re-change them to something stupid. ALSO will will Stop recording in mid sentence, after about two seconds. MAJOR REGRET buying this phone. Very little i like about this phone so far.. my old phone was great (Not Samsung)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Value for money"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No drop call"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm loving this cell! Sharp, clear, and precise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had to upgrade my phone when AT&T went to the 5g network. I purchased this phone for $600.This phone has been shorted in every feature: camera quality, device connectivity, security features (face recognition and fingerprint recognition), sound quality, and charging time when you don't use their special cables. The phone is slower than my previous phone.I will return this phone and try and different Samsung or go to Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cheap plastic backing, HORRIBLE 407 ppi, UGLY reds, poor screen quality overall, no headphone jack, downgraded power supply (used to be glossy with nice, visible grey lettering), no headphones included, sluggish fingerprint reader, and genuinely the most DISGUSTINGLY cheap Samsung galaxy S series phone I've ever had! Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything, without calling the downgrades out! I've never been so disappointed in a product. What a nasty joke of a Samsung S series. This is NOT a quality phone in any aspect that counts. I hate it. I do not reccomend buying this. Coming from the S9, this is a MAJOR downgrade and I'm furious about it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone ever!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has a good camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Package as advertised. Delivered to the wrong house, though."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is everything I expected and more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My original review did refer to the product, so I'm not sure what else to say other than this phone is not what was expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great at first but in less than 3 months started having issues with the phone not working properly. The issues have NOT been resolved and the phone has not been replaced. Very unsatisfied customer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super bummed that it wasn't a new phone. It does look to be in good condition. Seems to work, but didnt come with a charger or any cables."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone. Learning so much"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone today and as soon as I got the phone, I install the Touch Screen test application from play store to check the touch screen issue. I can clearly notice that this model of samsung have ghost touch issue. I really liked the phone and it could be a flagship killer phone. But, due to this issue I have to return this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The best phone of 2020."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loveeeee my phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone screen to flimsy and it cracked up after 4 days after returning period"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery does not last a full day. Less than 12 hours. When using an app the phone will close and move to a different app by itself. GPS navigation beginning to give problems of shutting down begore reaching your destination. Not pleased with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it but fingerprint thing doesn't even let me do a fingerprint and I lose my data connection all the time and it won't come back on until I reset my phone and I have to do that 8 times a day"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone worked well for a couple hours. Then started getting message that wireless charging paused. Would wait for charger, Samsung model, to stop blinking red. Would try again. Maybe one time in four it would work. Took the case off and had the exact same behavior. Tried my old phone and it worked 100% of tries, so returned S20 FE 5G."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's nice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am very disappointed that I received a new S 20 galaxy that was defective. My husband told me that I sound garble when I called him. I was sure it was his phone not mine as mine was brand new. After a few weeks of people stating they had trouble hearing me I realized it was my new S 20. I just want it replace. Not have it repaired. It was defective so just replace it. I was defective from day one do the right thing and replace it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is not impressive in anyway. Touch screen is horrible, the battery life is the worst I've ever had. Lack of a headphone jack still pisses me off as well.100% wish I did not buy. Usually keep phones for 3-4 years. This one wont even last a year I know it already."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Couldn't deal with the phantom clicks anymore. You scroll and it clicks on random things. What year are we living in?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Dislike the fact that despite being newer and having w better battery, this underperforms compared to the note 9. Firmware issues causinf rapid battery drain and wifi connectivity issues... returning phone as it overheats to the point of scalding the user."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone hoping that it would be a good phone also for the certified qpad fast charger. Didn't not work work the charger. Phone kept getting hot even when I was not on the phone more than 10 mins. Stopped charging and took 3 hrs to charge. Liked the phone very much hated it had so much wrong with it for the expensive price it is."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased this online since it was a little cheaper than going into tmobile- its awful. I've had nothing but problems with it. It freezes, won't let me make phone calls, tells me randomly I don't have a Sim card, and nothing seems to work properly. Not worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","its a great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just got this phone 3 months ago and it fell put of my pocket (2ft. At most) and my screen completely shattered. As you can see from the pictures, my case took no damage. I called Samsung and they had no answer when I asked them about their ""indestructible gorilla glass"". It would have cost me $265 to replace my screen. So now I am out the $599 it cost me for this phone and now another $399 to replace the entire phone. Honestly, for as poor of quality as Samsung is putting out there now I think my next phone will be with Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked everything"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Total piece of crap waste of money. Half the time I can't hear people on the phone. It freezes, touch screen doesn't work properly. It's as if this phone was released way too soon before it was ready. It was a pretty inexpensive galaxy tho so I thought why not. Now, I know why not. BTW the camera on S8 has better looking photos.My husband is watching my struggles with this phone and he's using it as an opportunity to say ""see, I told you you should've gone with an iphone"". As an android loyalist, this is extremely disappointing and infuriating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is a joke! And that is a fan edition, which fan want that short length of battery? Just buy something else."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Simply amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought one from best buy with hardware version 1.0 and an another with hardware version 1.1. Bought a 3rd one from amazon and I have to save all three units have the same issue.Pros-Battery life-Snapdragon 865-Size-WeightCons- Touch screen issues. Even after three firmware updates, samsung can't seem to fix the problem.- Black crush issue. This is visible on all 3 of my units. Ended up returning all 3.- Android auto and bluetooth constantly disconnect. Tried samsung, oneplus, xiaomi, and lg cables and all seem to disconnect. I never had android auto or bluetooth disconnect on my older android devices."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Spigen makes good stuff"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone about a week ago and it's been frustrating to say the least. The fingerprint sensor is very hit or miss, mostly miss. I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery has lost 22% power in less than 2 hours with during set up.. My 3-years old phone lost 5% in the same time. I will see how it looks by morning time. I might hav e to send to back for an exchange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Noticed right of hand when power one that it didn't say Samsung galaxy s21 all it showed was Samsung galaxy and then after trying to use it was slow an kinda glitches and the battery life sucked I sent it back for refund still waiting on my refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it overall"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone stopped working No service need refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everyday use"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is simply great!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not last long. Waste 500 dollars just for 3 months and functional damage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is really quite simple. After 4 months of using the phone, folks at the other side cannot hear me. I looked up the problem online and found others with the same issue. From the least destructive option to the most I went through the recommendations. Ultimately I had to go nuclear back to factory reset. That worked for about 6 weeks. And it is happening again. Run AWAY from this cell phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very short battery life compared to my old s9+. My old phone also had better features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do not buy red phone if you have tmobile or sprint it is not compatible! Even though it is in the description that it works with them we went to 3 different tmobile locations and had the issue escalated to find out that the entire line of the red phone are not compatible. I submitted my refund and they recieved the item on July 2 its now July 14 and I have yet to get my money back. No response when I sent a message to them either."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why did this advertise, from Samsung, that it came with an S Pen when in fact, it did not!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works, but I definitely won't be getting a Samsung phone again. This phone has a lot of small little quirks that break the Android experience for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","One of the main reasons I bought this phone was for the dual sim function. It is a lie the phone is NOT dual sim. Waste of money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the worse phone I have ever owned. üò´ many great features. The one thing you rely want it for is for communication. This phone will not let me have conversations for over 5 minutes on some occasions I've gotten 10 minutes. When it started cutting me off is was not often but now I can not keep any conversation without being cut off. Frankly face recognition or fingerprint mean nothing if you can't use the phone for its primary purpose. For $600 I'm extremely disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone didn't work with my wireless company.Put back in box shipped back in perfect condition and Amazon charged me a $110 restocking fee .Be careful ordering from Amazon .It's a shame such a big company steals from customers"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Two tech from amazon try to help but with no good results plus I bought insurance and a case had to return it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no one could hear me talk when making phone callstook forever to load anythinghad to press whatever button you were wanting multiple times for it to finally take and then start to load."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is supposed to be NEW!!! As you can see in the photos, when I opened the box it was dusty inside and you can't see but there's a fingerprint on the screen. Also, you can see a sim card was activated on March 8th and I received the phone on April 4th. Also, whomever had it before had 50 pages open on the internet. I do believe I need to be compensated for getting a USED phone when it was clearly advertised as NEW!!!! I'm considering sending it back! PISSED OFF!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's not a dual Sim phone. It's one Sim and a memory card"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is sub par for this expensive phone. Chatted with Amazon rep and did nothing to help me. I hate to return it and go through the process again. I hate when things are junk."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The reviews say this phone will work with Xfinity mobile. Not true, I spent over an hour with Xfinity rep, and they found out the only S20 that will work, are ones they sell. No other unlocked Samsung S20 phones will work with them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone came brand new and don't turn on"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Verizon educated me on this phone. Said it did not support the two faster levels of 5G. Had to send it back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved it at first but then a line randomly shows up spanning the length of the display and refuses to go away. So.etimes it's pink. Sometimes it's green. Either way it is completely unacceptable and ruins the whole thing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only works half the time"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We ordered 2 phones cleared locked when it said in the description that they were unlocked.I spent 2 hours trying to get them to work before calling my carrier to find out they were locked. Amazon lied! We are buying less and less from them because of issues we've had. I called customer service only to get a rep I could barely understand because of the language barrier. When I said I can't understand you she hung up on me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Honestly, I've never had a new phone act up this much after just a couple of months. It's constantly freezing and the system itself keeps ""not responding."" I should have spent the extra $200 for the regular S20."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything I connect it to wi-fi it drop my phone out of wi-fi. I spoke with AT&T, they said the phone is defective. $600 went to the garbage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to get this phone on Amazon prime day and it has turned out to be the worst phone ever!! I loved the fact the volume is so loud, however it cuts out daily on speaker and just cuts out in general. I am so sorry I bought this phone and unfortunately couldn't return it within the return window because I was sick with Covid and covid pneumonia. Don't waste your money!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got the phone, couldn't make phone calls. Said it was unlocked but AT&T stated it would never work on their network. Returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ridiculous!!! I would not have bought this phone if I were aware that the memory isn't expandable like every other Samsung I've ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone has mind of its own. Closes apps while using them. Have call apps to identify and block private numbers no matter the app or membership type it doesn't not do what it should. Battery life drains very fast. Tells me my passwords and thumbprint don't match . Key board does what it wants. Example: if I type cat, the keyboard will do this caaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I type correct spelling and it autocorrects to sjsksbejdjsksns. So disappointed I'm thinking of switching to apple"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband had his old Samsung Phone for five years no cracks or scratches in the glass. Two days with this one and the screen is shattered from one two foot drop. Definitely buy a case this one has zero durability."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Many things I did like about the phone but I had more dislike so I returned the cell phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This product came without charger"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung and the US corporate overlords (Verizon, AT&T, T-mobile, etc) have chosen to prevent us from using this phone‚Äôs second SIM card slot. Evil‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄôT BE EVIL!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is great, so far. Finger recognition is hit or miss, often taking several tries before the phone will come to life. Bluetooth connectivity dropped more than my old phone did, for the first few months I owned the phone. Keystrokes are misleads a lot more than my older S5 and Moto X4 phones from 2015 and 2018.I've tried two different screen protectors. No improvement"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone itself. It's snappy and seems to work well (although the fingerprint reader is a little weak). My main complaint is the screen is far too brittle. I bought an s20 fe for both my wife and I and her screen has cracked once, been replaced, cracked again and mine has cracked as well. Both have been in cases with screen protectors and not been subject to abuse. Never had this problem with other phones. Sad because other wise is a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was defective. Worked with the techs at my cell service carrier for 2 hours before we determined it was just not going to work."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No finger print sensor or anything that makes this phone special. I felt the camera was average as well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this is the slowest phone I have ever had, it is constantly searching for a connection, or loading pages total piece of crap, picture and camera are average not worth the time setting up or buying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All was fine when i got it. Setup was easy. After 3 days or so though the screen went black and stopped working. I'm having to return it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Within the first 5 hours it shut off multiple times and the screen kept freezing. Ended up returning the phone. Your best bet is to go straight to your phone provider."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen is good, not bright enough, battery need to last longer. How do get my refund is the biggest issue with this device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Doesn't work properly. Phone blacks out and Amazon would not accept a return because return window recently closed. EF Amazon and the horrible supervisor that took this call."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this S20 FE 5G not seeing the fine print which stated all S20 models came with headphones (and a headphone jack) Except for the S20 FE. When the phone arrived I sent it back unopened."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Received refurbished phone instead of new. Definitely doesn‚Äôt work transferring from sprint to T-Mobile. Definitely a pain in the butt. Went out of town so missed the return window. Rip off"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has a mind of its own. It glitches on from sleep mode and turns the screen face on and off repeatedly over and over and over. Nothing makes it stop until it stops on its own. Super irritating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your looking for a phone with a great camera,,,THIS AIN'T IT.Go for a Samsung 10 .Otherwise it's your basic cell phone ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't even had the phone for a month yet. Love it. Unfortunately, without even doing anything to it the screen developed a hair line crack across it. Really annoyed and I've been a Samsung user forever. I haven't even dropped the phone yet and it's doing this. Very bad quality. Going to try to return it. I'm assuming this thing is defective. Will update once it is replaced with a different phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was great for the first 6 months but now it randomly won't charge saying it has moisture in the place where the charger connects. It's not been near any moisture and a professional looked at it under a microscope and couldn't find anything wrong. Really sucks because it cost a lot of money and it can't be returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Found out my phone also has the touch screen issue others are complaining about. Tested it with Touch Screen Test app, instruction is on Youtube. Two finger swipe causes criss-cross pattern. Jittery and unresponsive swipe action when scrolling through websites. If software issue it can eventually be fixed, but not going to wait around to find out that it's a hardware issue. Returning the phone after one hour of use. Guess Samsung cut a critical corner while trying to reduce the cost of the FE version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is terrible. The screen randomly goes black all the time, in all applications. Happens during texting, in email, search engines, social media apps, games. I will be returning it as soon as I can figure out which one to replace it with. Also, every time the black screen flashes it does a hit on the battery life. Have lost nearly 60% battery power in six hours, and I've had this phone less than two weeks. It was new in the box when purchased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was in new condition and works great but the description says it's unlocked and the one I received only works on Tmobile. The best part is I used a payment service since it cost me around 700 and I can't get that money back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a bad phone.screen response time, launcher and functionality is very irritating.Some people want a sleek, responsive and UI that is intuitive. This phone has none of these essential qualities.When I refresh this phone again, I will never look at Samsung.please look elsewhere and save yourself buyer's remorse."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","An obvious money grab. I won't comment on the phone as it has to be charged and without a charger or usb compatable cord that can't happen until I get one. <explitives deleted>"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Received with broken screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love the phone so far! It is pretty nice. The feedback it gives when you type. It is great.The biggest biggest biggest issue is that the OS is bugged. You can not leverage hybrid SIM it just won't allow it.SIM 1 if occupied prevents SIM 2 from identifying its presence. If SIM 1 is unoccupied SIM 2 works. This is not how it is supposed to work. It is likely the phone needs a firmware fix.I hope Samsung can address this big Oops."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen touch ridiculous. I try Swype or direct touch in messenger or Google search and it skips and is intelligible.. Takes forever to charge . Had Samsungs forever and this is a piece of crap."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Friends and family call me, phone only rings occasionally. Drops calls all the time. Search Google, phone locks up. Very slow. I am using WIFI and WIFI calling with strong WIFI signal. Same thing happens on cell service. Did I get a Lemon phone? It's been over 30 days so How do I get my money back??"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was not able to use my AT&T sim card for this phone. The technician said it's not compatible. It's only compatible with T Mobile and Verizon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It didn't work fresh out of the box. Getting refund from Amazon. Hopefully"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The second SIM slot is not working. I have to send it back. I bought 2 phone and both of them with the same issue..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When a friend told me they got it for 399.00 I just shook my head."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bad buy...doesn't work;too slow and lot of trouble with the internet connection. Not reccomend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It doesn't include earphones and if you try to connect some wire earphones via usb c to 3.5 mm jack it says device not supported"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Horrible experience with this phone and trying to get support. Keyboarf just stopped doing prrdictive text and spell check"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Product does not work well. It‚Äôs been about 2 months and the phone gets really hot easily, constantly freezes, and MANY other malfunctions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Typing correction is horrible. also multiple buttons to push to get to one place."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You would think for paying over 600.00 for a phone they could at least put a protective case on the damn thing. I didn't even have it 1 day andropped it in the sand from only 2 feet up and the entire front of the phone shattered and busted the glass and the phone went dead. WTF?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Deceptive description. This item came with a plain box looks like a refurbish item. This was not what was on the description of the item I bought. I intend to return this item but it says I cannot return this. I am extremely upset. Beware of this vendor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone will not charge at times. I think I would like to return it for the same phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Does not read sim card. I got the same phone from my cell provider and it works great and read the sim perfectly. Just pay a few dollars more and get one that works. NOT THIS ONE.2/6/21 UPDATE: I sent this phone back 2 months ago and STILL HAVE NO REFUND. I have contacted the seller and amazon with not even so much as a response back. Buyer beware!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charging cable/block. please mail me a charging cable and a charging block asap"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is NOT unlocked !!!! I bought it for a present and now my friend is having an AWFUL time trying to unlocked !! I hate hate thisI will never ever buy a Samsung againAmazon let me down so bad !!!‚Äô"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had Droid phones for years and had solid connection at my house. This phone with Verizon wouldn't connect at all. Moving to T-mobile has helped a little but still lots of voice drop outs and dropped calls. Putting Verizon Sim back into old Droid is rock solid connection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I returned this phone. I didn't realize it didn't have Advanced Messaging on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No receipt. Phone box had been previously opened the seal was broken the instruction papers all undone out of box. Fingerprints on phone where someone had taken cellophane off previously. Thought I was purchasing a new phone that I could get a manufactures warranty, but you have to have a receipt and a new product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it just doesnt fit right. especially where the power and volume buttons are"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone won't connect to my service. Constantly drops calls."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","struggled trying to take out the sim card holder. once i put in my verizon card, it did not work. then i had a heck of the time retrieving the sim card so that the phone can be returned. data transfer from note 8 was easy. other than that it is incompatible with verizon carrier. its more than disapointing considering my business is built on prompt response."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really a $600 phone does not include a charger or a USB cord! Very poorly done!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is ""MADE IN VIETNAM"" and ""Box printed in Mexico"". Once I opened the box, first thing I draw my attention is the ""paper dust"" inside. I rechecked the box sealing, looks like it is well sealed, but dust come in from which step? How Samsung handles the product line?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything was great until the third day when I couldn‚Äôt make any phone calls. I could hear people on the phone, but they could not hear me talk. They wanted me to factory reset the phone every time this happened which was three times in one day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked the large screen. But there is only one problem. It cannot be activated! I have spent a lot of money on different sim cards including t-mobile, Verizon, straight talk even tracfone and nothing. SO BUYER BE WHERE!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Same as the other reviews, 2nd sim card does not work at all. This is a completely stupid setting!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No what I thought"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it was missing items and the battery doesn't hold charge"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My cell phone provider would not activate because it was made in Vietnam. Had to return."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't buy it if you want a dual sim phone!!I bought it on Amazon since I saw it supports dual sim in customer questions. Turns out it doesn't work and wastes a whole day of mine to figure it out. Maybe the esim will work but I don't want to spend more time on this.It's a good product, but Amazon makes it hard to enjoy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this because it said it's dual sim , but the second sim is not detected at all. I tried same sim card in both slots only primary sim slot works. Horrible...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If I can give this product is zero review I I would but I can‚Äôt I just can‚Äôt explain how bad of a quality this product is just don‚Äôt get it please it‚Äôs not worth the money don‚Äôt waste your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This isn't unlocked and if you go to buy a sim it will read that you can't have service with this phone. I went to Verizon and they said they can't help me ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your phone fails due to a manufacturing fault, expect to pay out of pocket as samsung will charge you for repair regardless of if there is any physical damage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has great specs, but is essentially useless because it won't read the sim card. I've done some research on this and it seems this is a persistent problem with this phone. Do not buy this phone until this bug is publicly acknowledged and fixed by Samsung. I will be returning this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 It does not work. It is a bad phone for the cost. the display fails and it is a general failure. also when returning it, amazon charges you 100 dollars to accept the return even though they sent a useless product"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In the description indicated that the phone support dual sim, but it doesn't."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Too much of a hastle to get a phone from Amazon. Shown as unlocked but when the carrier tried to install their software, they were unable as the phone was LOCKED."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like other reviewers have mentioned this thing has touch issues. I can be randomly scrolling on Reddit when the phone does something else randomly. I'm started the return on this , hopefully Samsung can fix the problem for there. i bought this in nov, or dec 2020 and got my refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not working money back"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Refurbished ripoff. Says new and is not. The screen cover to peel off is for an iphone, missing the phone key for the sim slot. Came out of box dusty. Not unlocked. Complete scam and now I have to wait to get my money back."

calls with headphones are terrible and echo-y.
i havent had it long enough to discover new problems"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've only had the phone for a few months and it just stopped working for no apparent reason.....extremely disappointed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Same as above."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Would not recommend the small back camera glass is cracked. Only had phone for 1 day...apparently it either came cracked or It cracked by gently applying the glass protector I bought for this very reasion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I feel pretty lied to since it said it was unlocked to all carries, but when I put my virgin mobile/boost disk into it, it said it wasn't supported so it doesn't support everyone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was a knock off from wish, the GPS didn't work, it was a scam"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm so disappointed I got a buggy phone, its like I got a refurbished one. Google closes on its own, and some apps do not work right, which works fine on my 5 year old phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Touch screen cannot be zoomed, over heats and does not fast charge while on wireless charging. I had a S9+ Before this after buying this I felt like I downgraded instead of upgrading."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was locked tied to another # and still owed payments on it. The Verizon Store said it was probably stolen.
So disappointed! Not buying phones here again!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this cell several months ago direct from Samsung, but I can't find any other place to do a review, so I'm doing it here. (Long-time Amazon customer) This phone is very glitchy. For example, the Bluetooth will not connect to my Toyota Camry properly. It stays in airplane mode. Even once connected (took 5 tries of disconnecting and reconnecting), once the car is turned off, the phone drops back into airplane mode. My prior Galaxy did not have this problem. Also, when connected to Spotify, there are small blanks in the music, where the phone drops the sound for a second, then starts up again. Also, when you tap an icon on the home page, sometimes the app does not open, but the home page shifts from page 1 to page 2. This happens often. Finally, the phone has a lot of installed apps which serve no purpose, but cannot be uninstalled. All in all, not a great phone!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Let‚Äôs go over the basic specs:
- Snapdragon 865 CPU
- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM
- Wifi 6
- 5G
- 6.5 inch AMOLED display
- Under-Display fingerprint sensor
- 4500 MAH battery
- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.
Pros:
- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesn‚Äôt perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.
- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.
- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isn‚Äôt stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I don‚Äôt mind One UI‚Äôs more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.
- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhone‚Äôs will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.

Cons:
- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldn‚Äôt stand the drop.
- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I can‚Äôt stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.
- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isn‚Äôt any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isn‚Äôt great. You can register a face, but it isn‚Äôt reliable in any sense and it just doesn‚Äôt hold the bar.
Odds and Ends:
- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I haven‚Äôt had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals
- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it won‚Äôt unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.

Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsung‚Äôs 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded to the S21 from my S10e and am so disappointed how big and heavy this thing is. Plus, if you don't have a case, it won't sit flat on a surface cause the camera sticks out. Also ridiculous that it didn't even come with a cord, much less a charger. So far I have nothing nice to say about this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unlocked Phone Issues"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the phone I PURCHSED is not compatible with GLOBAL SYSTEM NETWORK"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Beautiful display, fast connection but poor battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros: Very quick and lots of memory, great hardware.
Cons: Samsung apps instead of Google apps on an Android device, no visual voicemail, lost all contacts added or updated during time using this phone because Samsung is trying to take over all your data. Also, with phone securely encased in a protective cover since day one, after only three months of use the covered edges around phone looked horrible - trading it in I thought it would be in near perfect condition.

Summary - Traded this phone in after three months due to losing visual voicemail, then realized it wasn‚Äôt backing up my contacts to google as it was setup to do ‚Ä¶ Samsung wants all your data ‚Ä¶ probably my last Samsung phone due to all the Samsung apps you cannot remove. Not happy about Samsung causing my first contacts data loss in decades."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm an avid Samsung fan or should I say I used to be. I've used numerous Samsung products ranging from TVs, laptops, tablets, cellphones, monitors, PC parts, ear buds, speakers, fridges and etc.

My experience with this phone changed everything. I bought this in April 2022. I thought it was time to upgrade my S10. For a few months it worked great and all of sudden it would randomly rebooted itself.
It was just a few times a day at first and it was annoying but did not bother me enough to have it checked.
then it got worse and worse. It would freeze and reboot itself randomly more than 10 times a day. sometimes during web browsing sometimes using various apps or sometimes even during texting.
I did the factory reset hoping that would fix the issue. but It didn't work.
I finally made an appointment online and visited a local third party repair shop authorized by Samsung.
They ran a hardware test and told me that they couldn't find anything wrong hardwarewise. and that I'd have to contact Samsung and mail it in for further inspection.

I contacted Samsung and the technician told me that it would take 5 business days to inspect and fix. They refused to send in a temporary phone because their customers in the past didn't return loaner phones so they stopped providing ones. So I had to live without my phone for a week.

A week later, Samsung sent me back my phone and all they did was a software update. Ridiculous. I could've done it myself in 5 minutes.
of course it did not fix the issue at all. My phone would still reboot for no reason many times a day.
even simple web browsing was sometimes impossible cuz it would freeze and reboot.
I contacted the service center and they told me to mail in my cellphone again. Which means I would have to live without my phone for another week. Unacceptable. I asked them if I could pull up the log report from my cellphone and email them so they can verify the issue. (you can do it by typing *#9900# and choose Run dumpstate/logcat). I even recorded a video of my cellphone rebooting itself repeatedly.
They said no so I asked the technician that I'd like to talk to his supervisor. The manager repeated the same thing and told me I'd still have to mail in my cellphone or to my surprise, he tried to sell me a new phone. he said I could trade in the phone and buy a new one. He even told me that he could give me an ""extra discount"".
He gave me his quote($ 300 for the trade in value + $ 150 discount )and while him on the line, I went to the Samsung website to check how much cheaper his deal was compared to the one on the website. Guess what? no difference at all. not even a cent. I was really upset and asked him where his ""extra discount was"" and he told me he was sorry that I was confused lol.

I lost my temper and yelled at him. he apologized if his offer sounded misleading.
I'm sure there are many people who are happy with this phone without having any issues.
but keep in mind that unless you have a crack or noticeable hardware damage on your phone, forget about Samsung ever honoring the warranty and fix your phone properly.
and don't forget that you won't have your phone for a week only to get it back with the same issues.

This whole thing left bitterness in my mouth and lost faith in Samsung. I am still mailing it in to Samsung honestly I don't think they will fix it. I will navigate my option and buy a new phone either an iPhone or Pixel. but it won't be a Samsung for sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Our carrier is Consumer Cellular and we usually purchase phones through them. However on Cyber Monday Amazon was running such a great deal on these phones ($399!) we bought 2 of them. Well despite putting our Consumer Cellular Sim cards in these phones we could not get cell service. We called Consumer Cellular twice, Amazon product services, and Samsung's helpline. None of these could get our phones to work. The only thing we could conclude is that these phones came locked. And since Amazon sold out of that exact phone they would not replace it. So sadly we had to send them back for a refund. We were very disappointed!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone, don't like being forced to use a password or anything to unlock the phone everything I try to use it. The Galaxy 10 plus was not like this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phones are fine, but the company is dishonest and won't honor their own trade in policies."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've only had this phone for a month. I've not used it enough or downloaded much to be getting the ""not enough internal storage"" message. Battery life stinks too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a fantastic phone. I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.
Positives (in no particular order):
1) Excellent camera. It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief. Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it. I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image. I've never had that on a cell phone. The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good. Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees. This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera. It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.
2) Thermal throttling. Yes, this is actually an advantage. The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter. Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.
3) Battery life. I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.
4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse. Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio. Very few reviewers will cover this.
5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.
6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that. The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.
This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:
1) Weak haptic motor. Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.
2) People mention lack of glass back. I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.
3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people. Many compare it to the Pixel 6. Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many. In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6. A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal. So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison. That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.
4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot. This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from Pixel 3a, S20 FE does feel like an upgrade. It's not mind-blowing, but I can see myself using this phone for quite some time before the next flagship. One big reason for the upgrade was 5G. To be honest, I can't quite tell the difference between 5G vs 4G LTE that I've been using... Still, I don't regret my purchase and going to keep using S20 FE.

Pros:
+ Look of the back: I really like the orange color and the matted texture. I really do. It just fits me.
+ 120 Hz screen speed: it makes for a smoother scrolling when I'm reading the news or e-mail. However, it does eat up battery life
+ Camera zoom: The range is 0.5x - 30x, which is more than what was possible in 3a.
+ 128GB internal storage: plenty for me, a regular phone user to take pics and videos. There's an option to use a microSD, too, for additional storage.
*Side bar: this is a useful feature of Samsung phones. A shortcut. Makes it easier to keep my screen looking clean and organized.
*Spotify 6-mo Premium: I bought the phone from Samsung directly and it came with Spotify for 6 months.
*Samsung Smart Switch App: made it easy to port data from 3a to FE.
*Water-resistant: for Pacific Northwest, this is a must...

So-so:
*Camera: The camera features other bells and whistles like slow mo, hyperlapse, super slow-mo, and even food mode for social media. The camera is catered to social media for sure. FE has night vision, but tbh, 3a had better night vision mode. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.
* Battery life: 3a had better battery, but play with the power mode, this phone can last a while. With heavy use, this phone will die on you fast on High Performance or Optimized. Can last you a day under medium power or light use. I had this phone go without a charge on a weekend camping trip, and was able to make it last by placing it on maximum power saving. Based on usage, the battery can last, just not past a day...
*Screen (videos and pictures): it looks great. Colors do look a bit saturated when I took pictures with it. There are options to change to a more natural look, but default is the saturated look. Youtube, Netflix... Streaming is fine.

Cons:
* Bloatware and features: Coming from Google Pixel 3a, this phone comes with a lot of features right off the bat. Samsung proprietary apps do feel like bloatware, but not all of them are throwaways. Few are useful.
* Screen (responsiveness): it falls short. Randomly, the screen becomes unresponsive to where my finger is. That makes it hard to unlock my phone. The phone becomes frustrating at random times because I can't unlock the phone or open an app.
*Updates: no Android 11 yet...
*Size: ... it's big. It feels more like a tablet than a phone in my hands after a while. There is a one-handed mode, but ... the physical size is still big. At least, with such a mode, I don't have to stretch my thumb or fingers for too long. It's annoying though.

Despite the shortcomings, for some reason, FE fits and gels with my needs for a phone. I can see myself using for 3 - 5 years. Even with S21 coming out, I think I'll stick with FE for a while until the next upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't know yet to new
I read all of these comments the phone did not come out until January12 2022. Must be conifer or 4g. I order mine from Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Been buying Galaxy's since Day 1 of my smartphone life and this one, the FE20 is by far the biggest piece if crap made. I actually went back to my S10 as it is twice the phone (minus some camera stuff that is really unnecessary). Oh and the 5 G, turn it off as this phone performs twice as well while on a 3G network. Worth maybe $100 this headache riddled engineering fumble."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I currently have a Galaxy Note 10 and before that the Pixel 3. The Note 20 has been great but I've been wanting to upgrade to something with a better battery. I've tried the Note 20 Ultra (too big and bulky) and the Note 20 (not worth $999 or even $799) and finally arrived at the S20 FE. So far, the battery life has been great with 6-7 hours screen on time.

Compared to the Note line and pretty much everything else in the marketplace right now, this is a fantastic device at this price point. The screen is as good as the Note 20 line with its great color accuracy, sharpness and bright screen. While it doesn't have WQHD+ like the Note 20 Ultra, it does have 120hz which the Note 20 doesn't. So if you're running 120hz, you can't use WQHD+ anyway.

This device also has a fantastic camera system that takes better shots than the Note 20. I've compared them side by side and the S20 FE delivers more vibrant and sharper images. While the telephoto is only 8MP, it didn't seem to effect the quality and outputs pictures that were just as good as the Note 20. The Note 20 Ultra has an amazing telephoto, so if that's important to you, then go for it, but costing about $500 more than this device, seems not worth it.

If you're a Pixel user, One UI is an adjustment but I actually enjoy it with all the options it brings. Unlike past Samsung devices, their OS doesn't slow things down in the least and this phone is as fast as the Note 20's that I also tried out. Samsung has also been great about doing monthly updates and will be giving 3 years OS support on the S20 FE

I do wish it came with 8GB instead of 6 but I haven't noticed any performance issues as a result - the device feels just as fast and fluid as the other more expensive phones I tried with much more RAM. Perhaps if you're a gamer or heavy multi-tasker, this might be a bigger factor to consider in your decision to buy this device.

I've seen comments about the finger print scanner being unreliable but I haven't experienced that at all. In fact, it's been much more reliable and way faster than sonic ones in the newer Note 20 devices I tried.

If you're considering this over the Pixel 5, the S20 FE seems the better value with better CPU, 120hz screen and more versatile camera system (but the Pixel will undoubtedly take better pictures as its the camera king!), expandable storage, bigger battery and faster charging.

If you're considering this over the Note 20 (standard not Ultra), the S20 FE is a much better value for less money giving you 120hz screen, expandable storage and better camera. Unfortunately you lose out on the S-Pen with the S20 FE, but if you can go without, then the S20 FE is a much bigger bang for your buck.

At the end of the day, I think this phone is a superb value at $599 and the best you can get at this price point."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole. Just peek at the phone and you know the time & notifications. Always-on is the best feature. Perfectly happy with the styling and performance. Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.

I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery. Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter. I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.

The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention. A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly. Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including: phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more. What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps. It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to: Google App certification approved a set of ""unbranded"" apps to exist. The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information. For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity? There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"". [Try to find that in my apps.] The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos, swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous. Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed. Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements. Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.

The out of the box experience can be daunting. Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone. Setup can be never-ending. Each time you want to turn on the phone: you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be. Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let's just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.

A minor tip: The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box. For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting. After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot. There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top. The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got mine through ATT. I haven‚Äôt had any problems or issues. I use the Google Assistant a lot, and it‚Äôs better than Siri on my iPad. It brings up the results pretty fast and is usually accurate. This is really important to me. Battery lasts a long time, I can be on long conversations during the day and still have plenty of battery. It‚Äôs a large screen, which I like, especially having small screens in the past. But it‚Äôs smaller from side to side, and it‚Äôs perfect for me even though I have smaller hands. My photos are pretty good, I‚Äôm happy with them, and you scale it to way up close.
This is a really good phone in my opinion. However, the best phone I‚Äôve had is an Alcatel 3V, but they don‚Äôt make them anymore. The best battery life is Nokia, but that was when you couldn‚Äôt access the internet"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am notice all the bad reviews about this phone come from peoples who can‚Äôt even know how use a phone . Don‚Äôt pay attention if you want a real reviews look from professional tech . I am in shock how people complain about a cord or memory card slot in this time any high end device come like this also headphone jack is completely removed from any big manufacturer brand. If you want a good screen camera and performance buy this phone in my opinion is best value compared to the new galaxy s22 ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.

Pros:
Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.
Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.
Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.
120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.
MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.
Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.
AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.
Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.

Cons:
No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.
Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.
Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.
Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.

Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.

Edit - July 2021 Update:
Been using the same phone still since September of 2020. I saw this phone was on sale for $479 a couple weeks ago for Amazon's Prime Day. This phone is a no brainer at that price. The touchscreen issues were all resolved with a few software updates late last year. I have not encountered any touchscreen issues since then and don't have any further complaints in the past year. Battery life still lasts a full work day from 7am to midnight with around 25-30% battery life left."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone in December 2021 because I had broken my Google Pixel 3a (first time ever without an OtterBox, and first time ever breaking a phone). This older model was on sale, and I desperately wish I hadn't done it. The camera (which I use a lot) is, frankly, CRAPPY and not worth anything. If you don't much care about the camera, it's a fine, generally functional phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have no complaints about the phone, so far it has only exceeded my expectations. My problem is with how I received my package, which to be honest is probably Amazon's fault and not the seller's but regardless, I spent roughly $600 on the s20 fe, plus a charger, cables, and a case. The package arrived a day ahead of schedule but when i opened it I realized there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. You'd think for 600 dollars amazon could throw in a couple of plastic bags filled with air, or even just some crumpled paper."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.

As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.

I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It's amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I've gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.

Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it's solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can't attest to it's usefulness in this review; but I'm sure it's fine!

My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can't knock it because of this.

Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about this phone, I hate it...I can't get AT&T to replace it unless I get a whole new plan....RIP off!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just received my new phone and so far it‚Äôs working good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you want a big phone with state of the art features, the S20FE really has no competition. It does pretty much everything the more expensive S20 phones do at a much much lower price point. And if you have a decent phone to trade in (go the Samsung site for more details), it is practically a a steal. I traded S10e and got this one for $285. Hard to beat.
There are few minor difference from the more expensive siblings, like a glass vs plastic back and a 10X vs 3X optical zoom. The screen res is bit lower on the FE but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference. It is great screen. Oh, and no millimeter 5G, just the low end version of 5G, which is all that exists now anyway in 95 percent of the US. And a lot of places don't even have that yet.
If you can live with those minor shortcomings, this is the phone for you. Also be aware this phone is actually bigger than the S20 and almost as big as the plus.
The super fast 120 refresh rate is a big selling point. Something almost no other phone, beyond the S20 lineup, has. Makes scrolling super smooth and fast. Stereo speakers sound better than most phones. Wifi 6 support. In screen finger printer reader works well. But also has face recognition unlock. Infinitely customizable, as most of Samsung's high end phones are.
There are only a few downsides. It comes with a low end, regular than fast charger. But if you have an older Samsung phone with fast charger, it will work here. Some idiot decided to do away with a simple power button. You have to press volume AND the Bixby button to turn if on or off. Insane. You can change that in the settings and make the Bixby button the power button (which should have been the default). Bixby (digital assistant) is a major pain in the butt, but you can drive a stake through its heart and get rid of it completely with some effort. Google it. Many different settings must be changed.
Overall, this is the best phone for the money I have seen in a long time. Don't bother with anything else if you want a state of the art phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I went from a Samsung Galaxy S10+ to this Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. It sucks. I'd almost like to go back to my S10+! (Except that one was ancient -- it had become slow and the battery was dying way too quickly between charges.)
Anyway, back to the S21 ... this has AWFUL reception. It also has HORRIBLE connection issues -- when I'm on WiFi, I can't even send text messages. They spin for a while, then bounce back to me. I try again and again, and they may or may not ever get sent. Pictures will stall and not send and maybe randomly get sent 8 or 12 hours later no matter if I'm sending them (well, trying to send them) over wifi or cell to an iPhone or another Android phone, and regardless of the recipient's carrier.
The screen is clear and responsive, and it takes nice photos. But overall, I'm very disappointed in this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice Phone, loads fast, good camera, and good battery life.
Purchased on black Friday at a good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.
One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.
I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.
Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!
Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?
So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I use Lapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.
Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.
Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update when I test them.
Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!
Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed to get a most feature phone and must admit I'm quite satisfied, although most of the time I have LTE+ on the network bar instead of 5g, and the battery life is not that awesome. I don't use my phone that often with stuff like you tube or social medias but I have to charge it every night."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Is this phone dual sim?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","9/10 I have had this phone for about a month, waited to write a review to see if I was going to run into any issues, the only slightly negative thing I can think of is the facial recognition doesn't register a lot, unless I'm holding the phone at a certain angle. And the finger print sensor might take two trys sometimes. The camera is amazing, the battery life is even better. Charge time is quick, I had a note 9 before this and I am very pleased. Ignore bad reviews. I gave this phone time to have issues and found none."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Terrible phone can't recieve messages and calls.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It says unlocked for all carriers, but Verizon couldn't activate it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls. I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either..... The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe. I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges. This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.
I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.
I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential. It has reasonable storage.
The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still miss In fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.
THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone. This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL. I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case. The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger. So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.
It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.
I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.
I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one. That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.
Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch: The Wear app doesn't do much. It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face. As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My greatest disappointment with this phone was the fact that less than 3 months after I was having serious issues with the charging port. Amazon doesn't provide much support and was referring me directly to Samsung to have my issue resolved or ask for a refund."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","About the same performance as my budget phone. Unbelievable how much more money. I do not recommend. Won't buy another Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone has worked great for me. It is annoying how big it is but I am slowly getting used to it. I bought it for the large battery and it has worked out great for me. I only really have to charge it once a day unless I am watching videos then maybe twice. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after 10 months of having it my power on/off button on the side fell out. I have not been ruff with the phone. I haven't dropped it in liquid(s) or on hard surfaces. It just fell out from normal use, phone calls, texts, and watching videos. So far samsung doesn't seem to helpful and it sounds like this is an issue with the phone model, along with the volume button falling out. Hopefully that doesn't happen for me soon. Samsung said that it isn't covered under the warranty and only software issues are covered under the warranty. The were sneaky and sent me an email saying they were going to charge me about $151 in repair fees without even asking me if I was willing to pay."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm not a gamer with new toy. First thing was to disable/uninstall before temptation sets in. By doing so and using this phone for calls, messages, browsing, photos it is now been a 10 hour day and I still have 85%. The hardest part has-been finding a solution to butt calls to 911. Solved. No lock screen. Not worried as phone is with me. All accounts password protected. All apps are in folders so no problem there. Except I then had to disable ""gestures"" because of all the screens hots while in pocket. Bixby keeps coming on all by itself but somewhere I did see a remove Bixby button. Must have been once in a lifetime shot. Can't find it again. I think it is in a privacy setting. Pictures are good but honestly my old note 3 can compete. I had used fingerprint which works great but it brings back the chance of 911 calls. They should reconfigure the 911 button to bring up a dialer with just 3 numbers 091, then you can call 911 or operator. I got a case from caselogic and the plate charger has no problem. Also disable the phone suggesting stuff to me. Too stupid. These guys think I bought a traveling billboard. IT IS A PHONE. It would be sad to be addicted to a gamer, kill the battery and not be able to call for help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone and dropped it while trying to unlock my door which wasn't very high up. I had a sturdy phone case and the glass cracked from the inside out where the fingerprint scanner is so even though I wanted to keep using it it annoyed me because I couldn't feel the cracks but the phone couldn't read my finger prints. I sold it at a phone recycling kiosk for 60 bucks."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is a good phone overall but
The front facing camera is blurry in low light and the selfie makes your teeth somehow browner which is not good for a selfie lover.
Wish they fix this on update."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update#2: The reason you want to buy the Fan Edition of Samsung Galaxy phones is because you can use the Samsung DEX app. If you don't use the app than any android phone will work fine. But with the Samsung DEX app it makes all the difference. only the S phones are supported on the DEX app. Although the A series supports Windows Link. It's garbage compare to the DEX app.

Update: been using it daily for 3 months now. All the accessories for this phone is cheaper than the rest of the S20 lineup except the battery. The battery for this month is 3~5X more than other Samsung phones. Makes it expensive to repair, like if Samsung doesn't want you to replace it.

So far I thought the FE 5G is a pretty good phone.

You get the camera app of the s20 ultra.
Pro camera settings you can only find on high end cameras.
Dolby Atoms audio.
Micro SD memory slot. yep it's a option that's missing on the S21s.

Some minor issues.
Bluetooth audio device missing battery % indicators."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price! I love the color and style. It's very fast working, great sound, love the non-curved screen!I have seen some glitches with the fingerprint scanner,connection issues, and issues with messaging. Overall,definitely love this phone and always recommend it to other around me !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got my phone at Costco, and I like it for the most part. I bought a basic protective case without a glass screen. My phone has dropped 2 times from about 3 feet with the case, and the screen has cracked. I'm now investing in a case with a glass screen protector. I don't beat up my phone, but that is just WAY TOO Sensitive."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good. Item arrive earlier than originally expected.
If it does not work on your GSM sim card, do a little troubleshooting before you call your carrier to make the assistance efficient.
In my experience, when they activated it, it automatically work as 5G. I got that sim card with the phone carrier early this year. Idk if that makes a difference. I am still exploring but so far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I wanted to love this phone. It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.

1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.

2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.

Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure about anyone else but after 1 year the battery life is no good. Don't hardly talk ot text and have to charge it once to twice a day. It otherwise been a good phone. Note the battery draining started after a Samsung update and has gotten worse"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Every time i try to unlock my phone it doesn't register and you have to spam slap the s out of your thumbprint scanner with your thumb a million times before it actually unlocks, the face reco sucks, and i hate all slower methods so it's a giant regret for me. I've tried every option i can possibly find on google/reddit to fix it, but in the end it's just garbage. The rest of the phone is ""decent"" i guess when you can finally unlock it. I'd suggest either buying a cheaper phone and getting the same performance since it doesn't matter when the ease-of-use is not there, and everything else is just kept up to modern standards. Or buy a better phone for 150-200$ more. I'd suggest anything under the 20fe if you like samsung, or a google pixel, orrr any iphone 10 and above. gl."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros:
1. FLAT SCREEN. Thank God now i can get a cheap tempered glass protector and not have accidental edge touches. Works great.

2. 120hz screen. Full HD+ is perfect for this size and the 120hz does make a difference scrolling through websites and images.

3. Micro SD card Expandable storage, wireless charging, on screen fingerprint scanner, fast charging.

4. Huge 4500mah battery lasts two days for heavy users.

5. Triple camera setup. The 3x optical zoom on the telephoto is nice.

6. Nice feeling plastic back i like better than glass. No cracking.

7. Water resistance.

8. Great lower price!

Cons:
1. 6gb RAM is more than enough for my use case even when i play games but 8gb would've been nice to have.

2. 3x optical zoom camera is nice but also maybe a bump up to 12mp or 16mp and a bigger aperture would be an improvement.

Best Samsung Galaxy phone in the last 5 years!! Stick with flat screen and lower prices Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Absolutely the best phone to buy and have in 2021 it's perfect for everything you need trust me definitely a must have .

Also the battery life on this phone is extraordinary."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works fine but not enough memory."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Every member of my family got one of these phones when we switched to Verizon a few months ago, and every single one of us has experienced at least one critical failure with these phones. One doesn't receive half of the texts that are sent to it, and it doesn't notify the sender nor receiver that something went wrong. Another will unlock itself randomly while it's in a pocket and start opening everything and anything and then send or submit random gibberish text to anyone and anything it pulls up, and this is despite having the accidental unlock protection on. Mine has had repeated issues with the accidental unlock protection as well, but the icing on the cake was today when it changed my unlock pattern without any input. It was in my pocket since the last time I unlocked it, so it's safe to rule out someone else changing it to mess with me.
This phone is a completely unusable piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs. You'd be better off with a Nokia brick phone from the 90s than one of these overpriced plastic turds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is alright. After about 8-9 months of use the battery life is taking a significant dip. On the other hand, Samsung support is terrible and doesn't listen. I tried to get their help with a minor issue and they dragged it out into a 3 month process and they didn't even attempt to resolve my issue. I'm done with Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When you look at texts you have to push another prompt to be able to call the individual who texted you. Why not just push phone? Maybe not a big if you have time but if you need to make 3/4 calls in 5 10 minutes it is. The playback button is right next to the call back. If your in a hurry and busy that causes issues because, and maybe it's just me but sometimes I push the call back and have to hang up or talk to someone when I'm pinched for time. Another issue, that I had with my S10 when you push phone massages I keep getting texts massages. WTH! Only way I can get to my phone message is by restart which is more time intensive than the S10.
The people who designed this have no idea how busy a professional can be between clients, customers. If you have lots of free time and patience and are very tech savvy this might be the phone for you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.

The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Camera Picture quality is nothing compared to my note 10 and newer models and the battery life is horrible even after adjusting everything possible. When I looked into trading it in it's not even an option thru Samsung I guess I'm stuck with it. Save your money and by the note 10 or a newer nicer model. Don't settle."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It feels like a generation has passed compared to the iPhone 11. First thing I liked best is the zoom lens that zooms in 3x and does not loose a bit focus or clarity. Plus the screen is AMAZING. LED 120hz it is very smooth and fast. The downside is the OS. APPLE has android beat hands down for OS smoothness, screen sensitivity (I am often cought touching the sides of the phone screen and clicking when I wasn't trying too on samsung.) Being 23 years old I can learn to navigate android but APPLE IS BETTER FOR 40+ years old! Next year will be switching to iphone 13 but battery life is good OS just needs simplification."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cute phone. Feels a little plastic and light weight. Has a bad battery or something but I didn't have any problems with getting it to connect to my mobile network. My mobile network is T-Mobile/Metro."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had four Samsung smart phones. One bought from carrier, others bought from Samsung. The first one is Galaxy A, about ten months later, the inner speaker doesn‚Äôt work, have to use out speaker to pick up calls. But the carrier replaced it for me quickly. The second one is S9, about 13 months, it can‚Äôt charge by cable, because out of the warranty, I have to buy a wireless charger to use it. The third one is S9+, about 15months, the fingerprint reader doesn‚Äôt work properly, I have to use pin or face ID to unlock the phone every time to use it. The fourth one is Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, about 10 months, the WiFi cannot turn on. I went to a repair spot authorized by Samsung two times in a month, then they said they can‚Äôt fix it, need change the mainboard, no values for repairing. I have to contact Samsung. Guess what they said? They refused to replace it and told me I have to mail in the phone to Samsung then they will decide what they can do. That means in about one month, I will have no phone to use. For saving your time and money, think twice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the phone üì±,

Not crazy about the buttons on one side because of the screen shot process, will get use to it.

I used the S20 FE all day, more than usual, to see how the battery life was and to me it was great. I upgraded from the Galaxy S9 because I was tired of constantly charging it.

Do wish Samsung would give the ok to have Otterbox and other companies have cases available when the phone is ordered.

Well worth the money, did not want to spend a fortune for the S20."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros: competitive pricing for its specs, almost no bloatware, durable, colors look amazing

Cons: battery life is awful"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","On paper the phone looks great. But coming from an S9, I wish I would not have purchased the S20FE. The virtual proximity sensor is awful. 8 times out of 10, it will inactivate the phone if it's against your ear. But 2/10 times it will not and if you are moving around while on the phone, you will dial other people, hang up, put the call on hold - you name it. The LED notifications are gone and replaced with on screen notifications. First thing I noticed was the charging screen notification, nothing will burn in a screen like repetitive text. The fingerprint scanner is worse than prior versions - again the S9, was far more advanced. The Gorilla glass 3 will be less impact resistant than the 5 used on other phones. The glass has an odd cheap feel, like I have plastic on it, but I don't. The camera produces ok shots, but all need some touchups when I get home. Either over exposed or too much contrast... Selphies are also pretty bad, the fixed focus just doesn't do a good job. Then there are the screen problems. I haven't quite figured this out, but I get ghost touches and ignored touches. Playing with the sensitivity does not resolve the issue. If you, like me spend a lot of time on the phone, you better get a headset, as using this phone, as a phone will result in hangups and all sorts of issues because of the crappy proximity sensor.
I tested the Wifi compared to my wife's S9 and the S9 would consistently get > 120Mbs, the S20FE was averaging just over 100Mbs. Used the same SSID and was in the exact location. So the S20FE loses the battle against the S9 in terms of screen quality and scratch resistance, fingerprint scanning, proximity sensor, typing accuracy and wifi speed. Pretty bad that a 2 year old phone is better than a brand new one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good I got this on sale because it's not worth full price. Battery sucks, camera is good but doesn't capture movement very well/easy to blur, the voice text is glitchy and doesn't offer correct words when it guesses wrong, and the Bixby was sssuuupppeerrrr annoying. Also wish it was a touch smaller. MAKE SMALLER PHONE FOR SMALL HAND PPL!
If they actually made better phones in 2020 or 2021, I'd get that but honestly there really isn't anything much better xp"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","got this as a gift, so I returned it ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

no sd card slot!! It's like a bought an Iphone - garbage with limitations! Charging for more memory when sd cards are so cheap...Samsung can shove this phone in the trash with the old exploding phones they made!

Go to an older model or a different brand!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I took advantage of the T-mobile trade-in program to upgrade my aging early 2018 Samsung S9 64GB to this new late 2020 Samsung S20 FE 128GB which allowed me to get this phone for $200 + taxes. Overall, it's a very good phone for the price even without trade-in, but there are some pros & cons which I'm going to lay out below.
*** Pros:
- Price / Affordability. Obviously this is the biggest pro of the S20 FE as you can upgrade to one of the newest phones from samsung for not too much without having to shell 1000 dollars or more.
- The S20 FE has 6GB of RAM which is an upgrade over the S9's 4GB of RAM. Although looking at my Android's settings Device Care info, I seem to see a larger RAM usage for the S20 FE (around 3.4GB usage without any apps open which leaves about 2.6GB available when idle, versus around 2GB of available space when idle for the S9. So you gain a little but not as much as expected. This may be due to the new upgraded Snapdragon 865 processor being more memory hungry than the outdated processor on the S9.
- The S20 FE has 128GB of onboard drive space which is twice as much as the S9. So this is def a big plus. Also you can add up to 1TB of SDXC memory.
- The Cameras are much better on the S20 FE than my old S9, no doubt. You benefit from the 3 camera setup with good performing lenses on the 0.5x, 1x and 3x lenses. As a professional in the photo/video business, it's very welcome and you will be happy with the S20 FE's camera performance overall. The selfie camera also is a big improvement over the S9.
- The Fingerprint sensor placement is much better at the front of the handset below the display. A big improvement over the S9 which was at the back of the phone.
*** Tie
- In terms of overall performance and daily usage, I would say you get about the same performance as the S9. You won't notice that the S20 FE is snappier or slower than the S9 for most apps used. Browsing feels about the same, even though the S20 FE touts the 120Hz display, but has a lower pixel density in terms of screen resolution. Colorwise, they are about the same in terms of vivid colors or contrast/brightness.
- In terms of battery life, I see to get about the same performance as my S9, even though the S20 FE touts a larger battery, but also has a bigger display so it evens out.
- In terms of 5G performance, I tested it in a few places and I don't see much improvements in terms of Upload or Download performance over 4G LTE. It's very uneven depending on where you are. On T-mobile, I get about 40Mb/s to 90Mb/s downlink with 5G vs 50Mb/s to 75Mb/s with 4G downlink. and around 25Mb/s uplink for 5G and 4G similarly when I'm in a good area. So I decided to just switch back from 5G to 4G LTE settings on my android phone, so meh... as far as 5G is concerned... maybe this will improve over time.
*** Cons:
- My biggest con is the S20 FE definitely feels heavier and is much larger to hold than the S9. It is about the size of the S20+ and I wished they kept the width of the S9/S10/S20 so that one-handed usage is much easier. With a protective case added to the S20 FE, you will be hard pressed to use this phone one-handed unless you have big hands. I don't unfortunately. After all, they called it the S20 Fan Edition, so why make it so much larger? Samsung could have made the S20 FE taller but kept the S20 width... Food for thought for later iterations! Please keep this in mind Samsung. Not everyone wants a larger screen at the cost of having to use 2 hands all the time.
- As others have said, why did they put the volume buttons on the right hand side? Why not keep these buttons on the left hand side? Probably because it's a two-handed device, so they thought, might as well have everything on one side so you operate it with your thumb... Poor design/UX in my opinion.
- Loss of the 3.5mm phone jack. Alas this is becoming standard on most higher end phones from Samsung/Google/Apple... Sad... Now you have to use a dongle and can't charge & listen to music with a wired headset at the same time unless you buy another heavier dongle with those 2 ports (USB-C & 3.5mm) which may or may not work seamlessly... I decided to buy the Samsung 3.5mm to USB-C dongle because there doesn't seem to be a dual port dongle that works perfectly yet. And I don't like using bluetooth all the time with a wireless headset.
- It's still early for the release of this phone, so you won't get many good covers & screen protectors alas... I bought a clear cover from T-mobile TO-GO branded, and so far it is just too bulky & uncomfortable of a cover and way more expensive than on Amazon. But the covers on amazon are not yet shipping... Something to bear in mind as you will pay 2x or 3x more via T-mobile to get those accessories right away.
- One last small pet peeve, is the loss of the kind of clean wallpapers I had with the S9, now you get those flowery preloaded wallpapers that are just not UI friendly, they are too bright and busy so your icons & Time/Date don't separate nicely from the wallpaper background... You gotta download themes/wallpapers from the Samsung Store to get some equivalent ones... but not exactly the same as S9 which were so nice.

So in Summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G offers a nice cost effective way to upgrade your aging android phone that's say 2-years old or more... like it did for me with my former S9. You gain in RAM, drive space, and a larger display, but you lose in terms of one-handed usage and a heavier phone to hold, carry around, and larger to slip in your pockets, and no more 3.5mm headphone jack... sigh. There isn't much improvement in terms of performance, operability, or battery life over the S9, but at least you know that this S20 FE is close to being the latest and greatest from Samsung for the next couple years until you upgrade again to another iteration... For me, it's a 4/5 star phone and is worth the upgrade from the S9 still but I'm missing my S9 already because it was so good at doing most everything with just one hand... now I gotta use 2 hands with this phone most of the time... but at least I have enough onboard fast memory space with 128GB which will allow me to add more apps/take more photos/videos when the apps need the speed of onboard memory to take the photo shot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great all around phone. I have never had a samsung phone before. This phone is solid all around and an upgrade from my LG G7. I love getting 5G signal all over the place. The phone's battery lasts all day. The screen is crisp. The camera is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All the features I want for a reasonable price during black friday!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. It cost only $750, tops. I'm upgrading from the Galaxy S9. Although I can't find many changes, I can see that it's much faster. And all the previous features have been upgraded to present day standard."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I couldn't set phone voice volume outside of a phone call (even though I thought I had maxed out every volume option available) and I couldn't hear an important phone call. No headphone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I HATE THIS PHONE.
For starters: The gallery icon disappeared from the text app and I can't get it back.
This is typical. The phone make changes and never shows you how to restore them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is excellent, I love it. It has everything plus more. I love comparing it to my girlfriend, iPhone 12 plus which has no fingerprint unlock. And the features on this phone are endless."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone to buy IF Samsung fixes all the screen problems! Some software updates have been released but problems still persist."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had the phone for about year and it works fine in the beginning but the phone began to lock up after system update. I sent it back to Samsung for warranty repair and got my phone back and the problem was never fix and the pin unlock is still not working. So I will stay away from Samsung from now on. I have been using Samsung for over 10 years and this will be my last Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had it since middle of Oct. 2020. MY GRIPES: (1) As usual, I have tried 3 times to dictate this and I watch it flashing, then it stops and types NOTHING. (2) It FREEZES all the time, no matter what app I am in. (3). When I dictate period at the end of a sentence or comma somewhere, it spells it out. (4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase. (9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head, white shoulders and an orange background. I just noticed it a week or so ago. When I clicked on All Contacts, it shows Phone, where I back up my phone to and Verizon Cloud. Almost all Contacts had backed up to my phone. It was a nightmare to fix and get added where I 2anted them to be. I had duplicates galore. When I tried to delete or merge the duplicates, IT ADDS THEM BACK AS A 2nd Contact of the same person THAT CANNOT BE ERASED! I don't know it it is because this phone has Linked Accounts at the end of every contact! I think that is the problem.

I gave tried 4 times to dictate this to no avail. THIS PHONE HAS BEEN ONE MASSIVE HEADACHE AFTER ANOTHER. SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND TROUBLE!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am writing this review just to let everyone know that either some or all of the units have defective touch screen issues. Just Google it and you will find out. Samsung is not very helpful in this matter and their repair option thru ubreakifix wants to just change my screen which is not acceptable option."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is bad but not horrible.

Samsung software is like a virus you can't delete"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This review is for the experience buying this phone directly from samsung.
Trade-in, purchased worked ok
They offered 6 months free spotify but it never worked. CS doesn't help but asks me to directly contact spotify"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone from Amazon in November 2020. In most ways it's an excellent product.

However after 6 months of routine use the POWER button fell out of the phone. I searched online and discovered this was a common problem, but I imagined it would be a simple repair I brought the phone to a Samsung Authorized Service Center which told me that:

1) Loss of the POWER button was considered ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù damage by Samsung and would not be covered under the 1 year warranty

2) The POWER button is integrated with the display and cannot be replaced independently. So in order to fix the button I would have to pay for a new screen.

I phoned Samsung customer service and they repeated the same explanation, but offered that I had the option of bringing the phone to a Samsung owned service center (a 90 minute drive each way) where they would inspect the phone and if the loss of the button was deemed a manufacturing problem then the replacement would be free. Otherwise I would have face the same charge for screen replacement and I would have wasted half a day getting there and back.

It's extremely disappointing that the only frequently used moving parts on this otherwise fine product are engineered with such flimsy plastic.

It's extremely disappointing that Samsung does not accept any responsibility for the design problem.

Any customers who buy the phone based on its otherwise good performance and value should exercise great care when pressing the POWER and VOLUME buttons to avoid unwelcome repair expense."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First things first: it has no headphone jack. Every phone should have a headphone jack. Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead. If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you. The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras. Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.
The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes. My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.

It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review. But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Performance = 9 / 10 - fast Snapdragon cpu but only only 6gb ram

Display = 8.7 / 10 - 120ghz is great but screen is washed compared to s10/s20

Batttery = 8.8 / 10 - all day battery

Design = 8.7 / 10 - flat screen but bezels could be smaller

Camera = 9 /10 - great main cameras - selfie camera is MEH and pics can be blurry on moving objects

Features = 9/10 - three years of software updates..5g...a lot of color options .. ip68 .. wireless charging .. dex"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","trying to group apps into folders. When I select the app I want to group, normally it should show other apps that I can drop it on & create a folder. the Galaxy S20 FE 5G sometimes lets you do that & most of the time doesn't show any other apps that you want to group them with. I wish LG still made cell phones because this phone is a POS which is short for piece of crap."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone itself is pretty good, but the glass they use on it is terrible. Try to find what they use, good luck. Corning doesn't list this model as using their glass. If you need to have the glass fixed, it is easily the cheapest of the Samsung phones to repair. My phone fell 1 foot onto a wood floor and cracked all the way across. Cheapest replacement glass, no listed version of what they use, and it breaks after a laughably minor fall = bad glass. Do not buy this phone. But any other version of the S20 or a S21, they at least admit they use good glass on those."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.

I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.

The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.

The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.

Pictures are blurry.

Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.

Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the S20 FE so I could utilize the MST payment feature in Samsung Pay but since I received an International version of the phone, Samsung Pay does not work in the US. It is ridiculous that a Samsung app on a Samsung phone does not work in the US."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","AVOID THIS SELLER: TOTAL SCAM!!
WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STAR REVIEW!!

Have had nothing but issues trying to connect to a network. I have at&t, the phone won't allow me to make calls, can only use this phone with wifi access. It's essentially a small tablet right now. Even though I have at&t, the phone still says ""Sprint"" in the upper left corner. I'm trying to work with Amazon to return this phone currently. I'll update this review when I get a response.

UPDATE
No word from Amazon or this Seller still. This phone is absolutely useless. Sprint doesn't even exist anymore. I could not be more disappointed or furious. May as well have burned the $700 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If I sound incoherent it is because I am using this device's is this device's voice to text function is function to write this review to review so that you can see 1st hand you can see 1st hand how buggy this device is this device's. It's worse, you cannot open the weather app because it will automatically because it will automatically open about 20 crap apps of no Is possible interest to anyone . So you don't use it. But then it opens its but then it opens itself and it's 20 friends. Isn't uns. It even downloads new apps without it's it's new apps without asking if I want them and keeps changing my keypad and keeps changing my keypad to Greek or Swahili or is Greek or Swahili or Croatian or God knows what period . Is I am mystified as to why 80% of reviewers gave 5 stars to this piece of junk"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my unlocked phone for 5 days--bought directly from Samsung. I had it in light bumper case, with reinforced corners. Clearly it was not enough.

I was in a forested park today when I dropped it on soft ground. The back lower right corner hit a stone. It is cosmetically perfect, but it will no longer turn on. I've tried multiple ways to reset and charge, but it is dead. I've had 4 Samsung phones before. But I've Never ""bricked"" one.

I was disappointed in the case maker and the phone maker. I do not have a protection plan, but I feel like this is a failure of the maker of this supposedly shock resistant phone. I will contact Samsung, but I thought I should leave this as a warning.

It is a nice phone, but get a thick case, people."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.

UPDATE: well, things went south fast. This phone seemed great first couple of weeks but then it started showing problems. The brightness ALWAYS acting up, even after disabling adaptive brightness, when I am in direct sunlight outside it DIMS and I can barely see. The phone freezes and gotten very slow. Also every software update seems to make it worse, mostly recent update (3/26/2021) caused several apps like weather app to glitch. It's just so much trouble. I have only had this phone for few months and I already want to switch back to Google pixel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone at AT&T store - good phone overall, except for noted samsung weaknesses, including spotty fingerprint recognition, mediocre front facing camera, but the real weakness is a screen that dims to black on a warm (84F) day in full sunlight. The phone is not usable outside in bright light after 2 minutes due to overheating and black out of display."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worst phone I ever purchased. I researched and took time to choose this phone and thought I made a good decision. I was so wrong. Its overbloated with a lot of junk that dosent work. Battery life is terrible and charges incredibly slow. I can't depend on it to go to the store and have it work for me the full trip in case of emergencies. Calling it wireless is funny! It always has a wire for charging attached to it. Im used to Motorola moto z phones. I switched to Samsung to try something new and I'm so sorry that I did. My heart sunk when I took it out of the box.Never again. I doubted that it was even new cuz it had a funny sticker on the back that I had seen on refurbished phones id gotten in past. The most dissapointing purchase of 2020 for me.. oh i bought 2 :>(. Ugh im stuck till next year boo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had the Samsung 20FE for about 5 months. Had to replace my Galaxy s10 plus. What an absolute downgrade. The phone is buggy, has screen and charging issues. Constant bluetooth issues. Horrible audio feedback via bluetooth echo and static on calls. The phones hardware is a step down from all its borthers and sisters meaning this is the ""ugly stepchild"" from Samsung. Save your money, this phone will cause more stress and headaches worth than the extra 300 you saved from its better brother. My provider will not accept a return even thought ive been a customer for 20 years. Worst Samsung phone ive ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is nice, a solid upgrade from my S8. But it's basically an air hockey puck and will slip off of flat surfaces unprovoked. The glass is also not impact-resistant. Mine fell 18"" from a living room table while I was on the other side of the room and the screen cracked. $300 to repair after a week of ownership. Oh, and protective cases are on backorder everywhere, so if you order the phone, lock it in a drawer for a few weeks until your Otterbox arrives!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you plan on traveling internationally and need eSIM support, this phone has eSIM disabled by Samsung. The hardware is there but for some reason (likely politics between US carriers and Samsung) you cannot use this feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the worst phone I've ever owned. Run. DO. NOT. BUY. My husband was on a trip 4 weeks after purchasing and while walking through the airport it deleted all his data and photos and then locked him out. Too late to get a refund. Last week while my phone was in my purse the accessibility mode turned on. Then would not allow me to reset and eventually froze me out. It took 2 calls to Verizon and one call to Samsung to get it fixed. These are horrible phones. If I could give negative stars I would."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the screen literally cracked the first time i touched it. Don't waste your money. TRASSSSSSSSSSSSSH."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you buy the new s21 phones you are getting ripped off. The s21 and the s21 plus went down in ram, display is less, and the ultra starts at 1,400. I want to see Samsung eat these phones and lose money because there just taking advantage of people who don't know any better. So buy an s20 plus gets a lot for your money or but one of these phones they are equally the same as the 21 and the 21 plus. Thanks for reading"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone lags a lot and constantly have to reboot it. Certain apps cause the phone to wig out. My S8+ that was 3 years old was better than this phone and i wish i still had it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not a good phone. Does not stand up to other samsungs. Has a lot of glitches that just aren't getting addressed by samsung because its the cheapo version. the touchscreen works maybe 15% of the time. the rest of the time it is ""lights on but nobody home."" the fingerprint reader is absolutely awful. even when the touchscreen is having a good day, the finger print reader never works (it's also in an awkward place). nothing fancy about the screen, functions, or camera. overall very unhappy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The first handset had an unresponsive screen and was overheating like crazy.

The second one, the replacement, seemed fine out of the box until it started to overheat again and the battery would drain like crazy! Yet again! Also, this phone would just randomly freeze.

This was supposed to be my first samsung phone (based upon its great reviews), but, i wont probably ever get a samsung. My 2 year old Mate 20 pro is superior in almost every way!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not worth the money. Get a a71 5g for half the price for more bang for your buck."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The specs are great the camera isn't the best but you shouldn't expect it. The only thing wrong with the plastic back is that it's way too slick, even the edges. But the worst thing and the reason you shouldn't buy this phone is because the used old gorilla glass the break really really easy. Including the camera glass. Do no buy. Doesn't matter the rest of the specs if your phone shatters with the slightest fall. Look this up if you don't believe me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't waste your money on this phone. Retired my s8 and got a new phone with the same issues - lousy battery, screen freezes, and GPS does not work. Piece of junk for $700."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Device was great for 90 days then the charging port stopped working, and there are millions of hoops to jump through to recitify, even if you purchase the precautions to prevent such occurance.

Stay away from this phone if you rely on it for important functions. It is not up to the job."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is garbage since Samsung wants to force its apps on the customer. There is a so called ""Free"" app that wants to push contents on you. There is no way to get rid of it. It is always open and as you switch apps, it comes right as the first option"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was listed as a prime day deal, but come prime day Amazon said too bad. Samsung said we don't have any deals. Won't be getting any Samsung products again. Too many other better products."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I keep my phone in my pocket and the phone regularly opens apps by itself and even makes phone calls. Samsung has an ""Accidental Touch Protection"" setting but it does not prevent what I described. It is sooo annoying I would not have bought the phone had I known."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a OnePlus fan for years. I've owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They've always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.

So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I'm so happy with the 7t?

Well, I have to confess. I'm getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.

Then there's this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I've been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t's wide-angel lens isn't all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.

So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I'm not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it's 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it's 5x zoom? Nuts.

$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?

Now *that* was worth a look.

I'm glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I've only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I'm duly impressed.

Now I won't belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.

So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don't think there's really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""

The Good...

* I've never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I've dialed mine back to 60hz. I'm not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.

* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I've seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn't squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don't have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)

* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it's app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.

* <drumroll> The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It's a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone's crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I've printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it's workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn't use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they're unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I'm paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I'm getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don't do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.

* Memory Card slot. Why can't Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn't Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!

* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn't as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It's just not annoying. ;)

The Bad

* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?

* Plastic back. Some people don't like this. I'm fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you're spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn't going to win you over.

* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that's the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.

* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don't need 12gig, and I've never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it's time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.

The Meh

* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don't need 5G. I'm not streaming 8k to my phone. I'm just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.

* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it's utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!

* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.

* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can't tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )

Bottom line...

This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it's in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it's a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had the regular s21, and it was all right. Screen broke do to my on negligence. So I seen to s21 fe on Amazon for a good price. Everything on the FE is better fingerprint scanner face recognition and it's faster even though it's got six gigs of RAM instead of eight. I love it!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i had the following questions:
1. would it really be new out of the box?
2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?
3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?

The answers:
1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal. Flawless condition

2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera. With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.

The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness. The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen. i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness. But that means much less battery life.

3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediately

Conclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera. You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.

If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Did a lot of research after my old favorite LG phone's battery slowly died. This phone was categorized as something of a 3rd tier phone, and kind of the economy model of S21. Some of the ""experts"" has some critical comments about it, but I decided to give it a shot. So far, this has been a great phone that I'd recommend highly. Battery life has been terrific - up to 2+ days per charge - photos are very good, it's a good, easy to hold size and the 256GB of storage should be all I need. The phone is much faster than my old LG. It may not be considered a 1st tier phone, but it's all I need. My only criticism is that the phone is a little slick, which makes it feel like it could easily slip out the hand. The addition of a slim case solved that issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After a couple of weeks I really like this phone. It's fast and has a beautiful screen, big but not too big. My S7 died so I had to upgrade, this was a major upgrade for me. I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat. My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn't really lose anything, the rest was backed up to my Google account. I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor. Not bad for the price, I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did. The S7 was the only one that ever died on me, I have my original Galaxy, an S3, S5, S7 (dead) and my Samsung flip phone still. Now the S20 FE and I can definitely recommend it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Galaxy S10 has a raised curved screen so the sides can be used to scroll and get flashing notifications. There are no cases that can protect the screen, replaced broken screen protectors all the time. The Galaxy S20 FE G5 has dropped in price and you can buy cases that protect it. The screen protectors glass work well because the screen is not raised as much. 5G is faster than 4glite and gets more bars in our area where 4G lite is poor. Also T-Mobile‚Äôs new 5G home internet can use 4G Lite bands for large movie streaming users. My 4G phone internet has slowed down on T-Mobile. Need to upgrade my other phone to 5G. Galaxy S20 FE has a plastic case with a metal band around the outside. I always use a good case so didn‚Äôt need to pay for the S20‚Äôs with stronger housing‚Äôs. Great upgrade for 5G and save money if you use a case and screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from Galaxy S6 to this S20FE and it's night and day difference. Mild use of phone daily and battery is still 89% at the end of the day. Comes with battery option to stop charging at 85% to save your battery as well if you're interested. Great features all around. No 3.5mm but USB C dongle works just fine if you buy one separately. Can hook up USBC to HDMI and use it like it's own little computer or stream to a TV which is crazy. Can play PS Remote Play on monitor/tv if you hook it up that way. No controller lag with PS4 controller, both original and updated."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Before this, I had the Samsung S8. The S8 was great, until the market stopped 3G service. This is why I purchased the S21 phone. 4G and 5G capable. Works great on AT&T/Cricket Wireless network. Fingerprint reader is great. QR Code reader is great. If I have any issues I'll return and update this review."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","These slippery glass, expensive toys are too hard to handle - securely. Aside from the hundred of dollars, they are a pain to move from a broken one to a new one, a pain to reconfigure too. The Samsung S20 series are best of breed, whatever you will use it for, it is versatile, flexible, and there is an 'ap' for it that will do whatever you want any cell to do! It is sized to fit my hand, I think that it will fit your hand too. You'll need a teenager to get it going, configured for you and the flexibility is totally awesome. there are erbatteries in other phones, but this will cover you from sunrise to sunset."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from a Samsung J7 using Net 10.
Getting Net 10 phone number switched to this phone was not easy as I installed the ATT Sims. Net 10 switched the number OK but I couldn't call in or out. Finally I used the Verizon Sims and all is OK.
Note that Amazon has a Net 10 Kit for $1 with 3 sims, ATT, T-Mobile and Verizon. So try to find out which service your old phone uses. I gave them , the old phone sims # and they said to use AT&T but it was Verizon.
I love the S21 Fe's display, speed, everything works good but BIXBY is a PITA as I couldn't turned the phone off and the chat line was waiting for me to changes the sims. I found how to disable Bixby and all is OK.
It is very light and apps install easy. All is well using Net10.
SmartSwitch App was very helpful in moving contact, etc from my old J7."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my parents and so far they love it. The battery life span is great for a everyday use. The phone service is fast and easy to use. So far nothing negative about the phone.

Compare to the S20 and S20+ it's a bit smaller in size but you won't be able to tell the difference.

Camera is amazing. Pictures comes out HD.

I highly recommend this phone if you want a good everyday phone. For the price it's worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Legitimately love this phone, probably my favorite phone so far. It's lightweight, thin, sturdy build, fingerprint reader and face unlock work tremendously well. Comes with Android 12 out the box, cameras are amazing. Processor is smooth and amazing all day battery. Overall, perfect phone. It's a Samsung, so you can't expect anything but the best."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Forget the hype over the expensive, bank-breaking phones. The S20 FE is the next best thing, performs extremely well, takes great photos and video and does just about all the phones costing much more will do. The best part is you get to keep a few bucks in your pocket."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got it yesterday, and so far I am very happy with the phone. I upgraded from an S7 Galaxy, this one is much faster and has a lot of great features. The changeover of my data was fairly painless as well. I think most people would be happy with it. Wasn't too sure about the color when I ordered it , but I find that it is kind of nice to have one that doesn't blend in with whatever I put it down on. Also nice to have one that doesn't look like every other phone out there!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","While this is a great phone and big improvement from my old J7 I strongly recommend either Amazon or the seller make a bigger effort to inform the buyer that you also need a 5G SIM card. Maybe try the bundle offer and it would be more obvious that the phone does NOT come with a SIM card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is pretty good depending on what you do, so if your watching lots of videos a mid afternoon boost helps. So far I love the cameras and their capabilities, is it a ""wow"" phone, not really but it is a pretty decent phone with no real complaints."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery holds up ok, drains from 100 to about 93 percent within 10 to 15 min of very minimum use after taking it off the charger. After that, battery last all day. Screen is fluid and processor is fast. The finger print reader is a bit slow. Face unlock is very quick. Camera quality is great. Night time picture looks as if it was taken at sunset.
Would love to see the 8 gb ram version in the 5g model. Overall the price is decent for a mid range phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! great replacement for my old phone and very happy that I could take my sim card out if my old phone and put in this phone. Skipped Verizons upcharge and high phone price and I may never buy a phone from them again lol. Glad I made this purchase. This phone also had SD slot for those that need that like I do... The face recognition and fingerprint security work great too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrade to previous smartphone. It is a nice phone, larger in size but still suitable for pocket carrying. It charges quickly and holds a charge for the entire day. A very good camera and I am pleased with the S20 and did not feel it was an advantage to go to the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this S 20 fe in January and March 12th Green vertical line appears on right of screen return period to Amazon was on March 3rd and
contacted Samung chat on many occasions and was unsuccessful.This phone was $580."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loving this do far. Everything is so fast and smooth, response time, load time, recognition, etc. Only complaint is I feel like the battery drain faster than I'd like. After about 8 hours of listening to podcast, it's at about 30%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am hooked on Samsung, and have used straighttalk forever. I am not a ""put it on my plan"" type. I am still finding new things on my phone! I love it, super happy with purchase. Quick shipping, packaged well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's just my first day with the device and I'm loving it!!! A replacement for a soon to be doa device, you can use smart switch and all your data will transfer perfectly to your new device!!! So happy for my own birthday reward‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wanted a colorful case. But have to use protective case anyway. Kind of hard to turn on and off. Side buttons too low."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice phone have not had any problems with it since I bought it. Much cheaper than buying from the phone store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this phone but it has driven me crazy. The apps keep changing. Things disappear . It has had more problems to work out than any other samsung I've had but still a good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far I am enjoying the Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Very pleased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i dropped the phone from literally less then a 1 foot drop and the camera cracked theres no cases available for a couple more werks which is almost asking for people to break there devices, camera sucks, they expect you to not drop it when the material itself if very slippery and smooth, big fail from samsung i wpuldnt buy this phone save your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","WAS going to buy an S21 5G‚Ä¶ glad I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶This gives you great features PLUS external memory card access‚Ä¶ which I‚Äôd rather have‚Ä¶ larger capacity of storage and removable JUST in case phone screws up‚Ä¶ most newer phones don‚Äôt seem to have external... e.g. 5 S21'sHad almost a month and STILL putting in apps I NEED.. lolGREAT pictures and video‚Ä¶ super clear with Night Mode‚Ä¶Video and it‚Äô SOUND‚Ä¶ did a short video in the Van Gogh Immersive Experience with super Loud music‚Ä¶ audio was perfect‚Ä¶ not overly compressed and sounding true to live as you can get from a PHONE‚Ä¶(I used Master music for TV, Movies, CDs‚Ä¶ so DO have an ear‚Ä¶ lol)‚Ä¶Anyway... GREAT phone for the $$$"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I‚Äôve had this phone for a month and I‚Äôm not having any problems with it. It works just fine for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its okay since i have both the s20 and the fe"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is great! I'm not sure how the flagship version is better, because this has everything I could want, and for a savings of about $500, I'm very happy I chose this model! Works great. Great camera. Battery life is LONG. Face recognition is not the best choice, right now, because of masks, so I can't speak to that, but the fingerprint reader is on point."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone, very pleased with finger print reader... However you can only record 3 different fingers. Very good phone - excellent camera, especially front facing!My only complaint, why it was 4 stars instead of 5 was we bought the orange color phone for my husband and when it came it was more of a light peach/pinky color. A nice color, but obviously more girly than anticipated. It's an easy fix to cover up, but we were disappointed because the color online looks more orange than it actually is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast shipping, great screen, it's big and fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Is snappy, quick and does what I need it to do. Which is mostly watch videos and send memes to my sisters... it works. Looks good too."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have this phone but I didn't get it for the cyber Monday price Amazon had it at, I bought this one for my daughter, great price a steal really, thank you for these deals Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have an issue with touching the screen too. I always miss calls due the touch phone doesn't work when I try to answer the phone. Thought that my finger touched or swipe not correctly. Now just reading the one-star rating seeing that others have the same problem. Supposed to return it, but the window return is passed a few days. What's a bumper!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I have to agree with you all on Samsung. I've also been A fan of them I recently had the 10SE for 24 months they offered A trade . I got the phone. It's not charging and the phone is burning my hand. I feel within the past several prior to COVID-19 Samsung has gone down hill in their product's. So I have agree don't waste your money on this new S21FE either it came out on the 12 my birthday and I'm very disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have use galaxy's for years, this was the worst I have encountered and am going to Iphone. Lots of Bugs, fragile as an icicle.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I already had this phone for my wife and it was incredible i am getting this same phone for myself and for such a phone it only costs 600 bucks which is amazing and 128gb is enough storage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked what it provided and is a great phone for my needs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My girlfriend loves it, it's probably the best phone she's ever had. Everything on this FE is amazing the Face recognition is on point, fingerprint reader is fast as he'll and you can store up to three fingers which is awesome. The battery life is well you know it's pretty much the same as all Samsung devices. But all and all it is a great phone and the price you can not beat. I the S21 and the S20 FE is just as good as mine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is the reason I bought a new phone. So far, this is lasting two days on one 100% charge. Not to mention all the other great features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Dual sim on us version and refurbished from Amazon came in great condition!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good deal for the money...nice size...5G but no longer carried in stores"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like that it works but seems to somewhat basic. I will say that this phone has been dropped and still works."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not found anything I don't live about this phone. I would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a little bulkier than expected but I love this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great Camera and memory and storage for many files"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got the phone july 5th. I haven't even had it a month yet and this morning when I plugged the phone in to charge it started smoking and the charging port on the phone now smells burnt. They refunded me my money but now I have to try to find a phone for the same price. I don't understand why they couldn't just send me a replacement phone. Huge inconvenience and now I have no phone until I buy a new one since I can't charge this one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Very pleased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought to replace Samsung S8. well constructed and the cameras are fantastic. Wish it were smaller like the S8 it replaced. Unless you have a purse, it is too large to carry around in pockets"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.Second Update (March 18th 2021) Nothing much to add about the phone. My original opinion still stands. The fingerprint scanner can be a pain sometimes but works the majority of the time. Samsung has been doing a good job updating this phone too. I just wish this phone had a headphones jack (at least it has expandable storage)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the phone. I am having some issues with carrying it in my back pocket, the screen doesn't want to work for a few minutes. And when I try to scroll, it clicks on things."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed to upgrade from my S9. This had everything I needed and didn't cost $1000. Got it on Prime day for less than $400"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No issues, will update if anything pops up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera quality is super!! I am still getting used to the phone. Learning a new phone is tough for those of us over 60."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just Got My Samsung Galaxy S20 FE yesterday and I open and tested it if it is a good phone....it is a nice looking phone, but the problem is it was heating up and drained the battery to fast.....only 4/5 hrs of use time at fully charge!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its not cheap but its the best phone I've ever had. It works great with zero issues and works perfectly with my Samsung smart watch."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything is as it should be. Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I previously used the A71 4G (international version) and loved that phone. However, it had severe signal problems after I moved to a new area, so I started looking for a US version 5G phone. I was considering the A71 5G or the new A52, but I couldn't find one unlocked that would arrive quickly enough. Then I remembered this phone and boom...exactly what I needed, and for just a bit more money than the A52. I don't absolutely need flagship specs, but I must say that I'm enjoying the upgrade from my A71. Everything works flawlessly and fast. Camera is excellent. I do miss the headphone jack, but I got an adapter that works fine. If you're buying unlocked, I think this is a better deal than a new A-series Galaxy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","waited forever for this phone to go on sale. Finally bought it on black friday. However, the phone i received was clearly an opened box: screen plastic film was the wrong fit, the box seal was not original, the wire was not in a tight bundle.Be careful with Amazon, it is starting to ship opened box/returned items as new items!!! I just cant believe that they are doing this with high value items such as cell phones now... extremely disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is an incredible cell phone (but for me I came from a much worse cell phone), its construction, its screen, its fluidity, everything was incredible... until the big bugs began, I don't know why I experience so many bugs in apps like YouTube and some games, I do not know if it is a factory error or what, but in the cameras I notice a small fluff that is in a camera (it does not bother the camera) and I already confirmed it and it is not a scratch or a stain that can clean."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn't get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it. The box was closed with tape but very loosely. As well as there being dust inside the box when opening it. Kind of suspect in my opinion. But only time will tell I guess."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off, love this phone. Works great for all my needs, and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service, I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home, I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there, but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability, including the gurrilla glass- I still can't believe I'm typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! It works well and would suggest to anyone to buy it. The flat glass is a good improvement over the curved glass of the last one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone for about 450 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No where does the description of this phone say it is a used or referbished phone. This seems to be a bait n switch deal! Very shaddy to not put in the add that its a used or referbished phone!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My SO has been a longtime iPhone user and wanted to try something new. I as an Android person suggested this phone as a good place to start and she hasn't put it down (mostly because she is learning the ropes). Otherwise, it is quite a capable phone. She loves taking pictures and this has the dual Sim/Micro SD slot so I put in enough extra memory that she will be taking pictures for quite some time. Battery life is great and the big hang she loves about it is the quality of pictures it can take. I will definitely be looking for an upgrade along this line of phone in the future."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just works as it is advertise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have no clue what items the phone is supposed to ship with. I was surprised that this was a used (Amazon terminology is renewed) phone and the price was almost that of a new phone. I don't use fingerprint readers nor face recognition. I have no idea about the battery as it is a used phone (maybe the battery is OK). I had to Google search to find out where the SD card went. I chose the S20 instead of an S21 for the SD card slot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had the phone for about two weeks. After waiting on TCL 10l 5G, Oneplus Nord (that didn't launch state side)_, and Google Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 I had to jump on on this phone. I was able to get the phone for $100 less then Pixel 5 with a stronger processor by preordering the phone. Another plus is I also got a $70 Samsung gift card for preordering the phone. This is my 3rd Samsung phone since the S3. Sadly their phone were getting too expensive with only two years worth of updates.The Positive: The phone comes with the latest flagship processor,120 hz display, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, and at least 3 years of updates. It comes with fast wireless charge, power share, the underside doesn't feel cheap, and battery last me the whole day between work and playing games. ""The 1st thing that came to mind when I turned the phone on was how I have been missing out on how beautiful Samsung's amoled screens are on.""The bad: It comes with gorilla glass 3 I would invest in a screen protector. The phone doesn't come with a 25w super fast charger I guess to keep the cost and it is missing a USB c to c cable to transfer data. (the 15W fast charger it comes with takes about 1hr 30 mins to fully charge my phone while the $12 super charge I bought of Amazon takes exactly 1 hr to charge my phone to 100% Another negative for me is Samsung UI which will delay Android 11. My second thought after 1 hour was ""I don't miss Samsung horrible UI and I would prefer a more vanilla android experience."" I really shouldn't have to use a second launcher like Nova to customize my phone.Overall: This phone is feature proof with 5G (won't be viable for another 3 years) and 3 years worth of updates. I am very excited about the phone and look forward to Samsung releasing more affordable phones with flagship specs in future. Definitely a better value then any other phone on the market if you can live with Samsung UI.Oddity with 5G not the phones fault: I have tested 5G and 4G on T-Mobile network and for some odd reason I get half the speed 4G gives me. (5G is definitely still in its infant stage and don't expect any real speed differences to come until 2022 with 2025 being reality.)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So, I have had many wireless phones over the years; I actully worked for Sprint back when PCS was first starting, and this is the first time I have ever purchased a phone from some place other than a brick and mortar store. The phone worked great and the transfer of pictures, text and apps went without a hitch. I took the SIM card out of my old phone and put it in this phone and the only problem I have is that my car still thinks it is the old phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was seating on the curb and my phone fell out of my pocket crashing screen. It was less than 1 feet height!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","GOOOD"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything on it, excellent flagship smartphone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased this for my nephew, he really, really is enjoying it‚Ä¶ great camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I did some research on the S20 vs the S21. The reviews were accurate. Although its not the latest Samsung product, the S20 is just as good as the S21. For my needs, the differences were minor and the refurbished price was too good to be true."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've got for a good price every thing about is worth each penny. The plastic back doesn't feel cheap. I can actually get a grip on it with out a case not like other phones with glass all over that slip off my hand consistently"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone! Had S8+ for 5 years and have to say with the exception of a few sensors and appearance this phone is great for less than half the cost ! Bought one for my wife and after 5 months of her using it and needing to replace my old phone I purchased one. Very happy with it and look forward to years of service from it !!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone to keep up with the technology of the cell phones. My S7 just got too slow and too outdated. It still works but it won't be long before it can't be updated or supported by the newest versions.I like everything about it. Much faster for streaming. Pro camera for pictures and video with editing. Lots more memory. Etc."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far, I really like it. Some features are taxing my nerves, but I expected that since I am technology challenged. It was easy to change from my old galaxy and still have everything I had before, only better and more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's everything I wanted and I'm very happy with it. I have not been happy with the A51 I've been using and I'm thrilled that this phone works more like the old Galaxy that I had except better!! It is also compatible with the Consumer Cellular network and I had no issues getting hooked up. It's nice that it comes with the tool to remove a sim card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was an ordered item as per family members requirements."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Security , battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cameras - check, with good zoom up to 10x (more is so-so).Battery life - check, with 2 days of use.Screen - check, gorgeous AMOLED with fast refresh rate.Fast CPU - check, Snapdragon 865, games are flying.Carrier LTE compatibility - check, see kimovil website.Brand name - check, Samsung FTW.Friendly price - check!Anti-bloatware - check, see xda website.???Profit!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The voice quality is very clear and the two buttons works well. The screen size fits me well. The picture quality is great. I need some time to get used to the screen unlock gesture because it seems to be easily confused with the camera function. I have also been directed to Samsung Pay without intention of using it. Overall, I think I have made the right choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Shipping was very fast! I see another of customers are talking about the sim card not included, but it says in the print! Very simple to purchase the sim card anywhere you're activating the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Replaced a S8. Transfer was quick and features are good. Battery life is good but not great. Needed 5G capability and larger screen. Unlocked so we have flexibility to shift carrier."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm totally happy with this purchase. I haven't had it set up long enough to do face recognition . battery life seems to be OK. The power cord does not work and quick guide is for a different phone but other than that it's great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was waiting for the Pixel 5 which came out the same time. The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi & cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts & and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts & call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Changed from iPhone SE to this Galaxy20 FE. Very glad I did. I like the larger screen for all of my tasks. Very intuitive, much better than iphones in my opinion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this new phone. User friendly with great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from the Samsung S8 and this so far has been great. Pictures are crisp and clear, runs quickly. The only thing I found is that the battery life is not all that great but I am also using the phone a lot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Liked all the features, still learning about the phone. The shipping and handling had no problems. Very good service."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works, as I am using it right now to leave this review. There have been no issues with functionality and the camera is a major upgrade from my S8! Also, the larger screen is nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is pretty sick, I came from a galaxy s8 plus 4 gig with an exynos cpu, which had died and wouldn't turn back on. So I decided to just go with this, its fast and has a great display, takes good pics and all that. Its definitely a good bang for your buck. There is something just slightly off about the touch screen its literally nothing big its like my s8nalways hit the numbers to unlock even if I was typing super quick but sometimes this phone will maybe miss a key press but its rare."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely not orange. The orange color option is definitely Pink instead, so thank you for sticking me with a pink phone for the next two years"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my wife and I have the Galaxy S20+, but besides the screen size we haven't been able to tell a notable difference other than the FE being much more affordable. Having Galaxy phones since 2011, they are the best and will continue being the best over the fruit phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this phone for what it is. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S7 that was on it's last legs. Since I need to have a phone for work, I decided to stay with Samsung as I like their hardware more than any other phone I've tried. I work in IT and I can say that the Samsung phones are pretty reliable and fast. This S20 is no different. The screen is nice, large, and vibrant. My apps are opening very quickly and the battery lasts a lot longer than the older one in my S7 was. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a good phone with nice camera setup and good screen. Make sure to pickup a case for it and you'll be good to go!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very nice mobile phone. Easy to set up and use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not impressed with the battery life otherwise a nice phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I love this phone easy to use an the camera is everything! Battery life is amazing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","great phone for the price that I purchased for new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it - clash of clans works perfect on it. It is hard to talk to people on it sometime bc they cant hear me but its due to the water proof case. Its run very good since I got it a few months ago. Can't complain"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","ProsThe phone is quick loading appsDual speakers instead of one speakerFinger print scanner and face rec have worked without issueConsConsidering what is available nowadays the camera quality is mediocre. Should have just put a better main camera and deleted the 30x zoom lense that's just too pixelated for distance shots.Battery life barely makes it through a day even with the phone on medium power saving/disabled app background usage. (Battery drained 10% in 10 hours overnight while not even being used)No port for headphone.Overall I could have gotten a cheaper phone and lived without things like face rec and in screen finger print scanner, wireless charging, etc. Would prefer better battery life and better camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone (S20 FE 5G UW) for 20 months so far and it's as good as new. Camera is really great. The processor is as fast as a flagship phone of 2021. My favorite feature is the battery. It will easily exceed 24-36 hours between charges with normal use. The superfast charge will go from 0% to 100% in under 90 minutes. I really have no complaints about this superb phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. The camera system could be the best out presently. The ability to add memory. I can' not imagine what I DON'T yet know about this outstanding phone. The reception and clarity are great. Noise and dropouts have yet to happen. This is a very fast operating phone. The sound is great. Got mine on sale for $599.99 (Amazon) and could not be happier. Amazon is an authorized seller. Avoid 3rd party's if you want the warranty intact. Contact any dealer before you buy to be certain the phone is new and under full warranty. Samsung can also answer this. Be sure to put a good protective cover on it. Also. Some complain that when they install a screen protector the tough sensitivity and fingerprint ID don't work well. There is a simple menu setting to adjust touch sensitivity under SETTING's. This solves the issue. Even without a case, this is a well built phone. But use a lanyard so if you do drop it, it won't hit the ground. Best phone out there for the money. 5g ready and acts as a hot pot too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded (?) from the Samsung S9. I've only had this phone for a few weeks, but here are my first impressions. Looks like I'm going to have to spring for another set of $100 + for Bluetooth headphones since this phone doesn't have an audio port for them. I often use headphones for an extend period of time. When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings. Other than that, it's a decent phone. I may just keep it until I find something that fits my needs better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have bought it at Thanksgiving. Everything in the phone make me happy but delivery. I received it 8th Dec. I knew that it was a pre-order but delivery was later than expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the bigger screen. I was worried about no phone jack but I bought a really cool wireless headphones set and it's actually better. I bought the Tracfone Sim Kit so that was a super easy process. Definitely recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing phone for the price.I would say price per feature this is the best deal I have ever got on a phone in my life. Upgrading from an s8+ I wouldn't know what could possibly even be better on the s21 models that just came out.I used to be all about the latest phones but it gets tiresome after a while. If you are looking for a cheap phone without sacrificing anything in terms of quality.. This is the phone for you. Amazing speed, amazing pictures, fast and snappy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Keyboard disappears here and there and you have to relaunch it somehow.I guess it's a matter of getting used the phone is all. Updated to Android 12 on 2/5/2022The battery life is just average, but that depends on how you use your phone, how much you doing the internet, downloading, etc.Otherwise, it's a really nice phone and I'm really happy with it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great cameras, great display, fast UI, good sound, etc. Wife loves it and it is a big upgrade from Huwei Mate SE. Battery life is good and everything seems to work well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I got this phone around 12pm, activated it with tmobile around 2. Got a screen and case for the thing. First review was in regards to the box not being wrapped and there was ALOT of dust on the screen. If the phone is new why is there dust and a thin screen protector thats slapped on sideways. Fortunately for these folks I already did to much to the phone to want to go that far to return. however I would of returned based on the face I just spent from 4pm to now at 8pm trying to successfully update my phone. This is my SECOND S20FE and im very technology savvy. For I use to work for Apple, but I prefer galaxy all the way. But why do I have a brand new phone and I have to to through articles hard resets, updating over and over again just for it to tell me its not updated again! Well finally at 8pm and me not giving up not wanting to have to return the phone I finally was able to successfully update the phone. I called Amazon HELP and they hung up on me. All the way I want to give the phone amazon and SAMSUNG 2 STARS 1 star because I still love galaxy and the other star for my self I guess cause no help from amazon or samsung I fixed it myself. Oh and im also very upset that u locked samsung phones don't have the read receipt feature have to download messages and that even took me another half hour reading articles and discovered on the forum I had to download the carrier services app to even be able to use messages chat features. Even though it says my phone should be compatible to use at this point im just tired....I'll end up buying another phone down the line but right now I don't have time and I guess ill just be grateful for the time being.... will NEVER order from samsung again I guess to get all features you have to be a SLAVE to a carrier!!!"

Most of all, I love the price of this phone. You get all the high end perks, without paying the high end price!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone shipped quickly and is definitely factory new. Still learning how to operate, fingerprint security feature is too slow to set up, it can't read my fingerprint for some reason. Camera is good, sound quality is pretty good here in the hills.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I freaking LOVE my new Samsung Galaxy s21+!!! My s9 of 3 years was acting up on me so it was about time I upgraded. I heard that it only includes a recharge cable but not an adaptor, which was alright since I had to replace my own a week prior to me getting this. What I don't like (which is why I gave this phone a 4 star) is that Samsung pulled an Apple and also took out the audio output to plug in your headphones! So if you love listening to music like me, get a special type c audio adaptor for the s21 and s21+. Or if you don't mind that be sure to get wireless headphones or earbuds that support Bluetooth. Be sure to back up all your files to your Samsung account and Google accounts (like G-Photos) that way when you do the transfer (wireless or though cable connecting) you'll get everything downloaded on your phone. Reason I say this is because these newer phones don't come with a micro SD card slot anymore, Probably because of all the extra storage it already comes with. (mine is I think 182GB) All in all, I love my new phone and have no regrets!! ü•∞"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the phone itself, there is pretty much no compalain.. except with the Finger Printer Reader. I have added a 360 cover but unable to detect finger print. Would hope Samsung to come with a more sensitive finger print sensor.

With Prime Deal, it's a great deal but not the best. I bough an S7 on Prime days 3 year ago and it was much much better deal. Would hope to see better Prime Day deal with Samsung phones in the future

With the shipping to Canada. It took a bit of time, would hope to see a quicker turnaround. Also, with my order, it was shipped the first time and somehow the courier returned it back to Amazon. I have to call and they have to process a ""return"" to trigger a re-send. It costs me another 3 or 5 days. Could have been smoother but overall it's ok. Also, the Import fee is resonable. It charged me around 15% but sent me back a refund after. Overall, the fee was around 11.5%, which is slightly cheaper than my provincial tax."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I came from the Samsung A70 (a $400 phone), and coming up to a flagship is a MASSIVE difference. I liked the camera on my old phone, it was fine, but on the s21+, it is phenomenal! Just the camera upgrade is great, but the 120 refresh rate is great too. I've heard YouTubers talk about the refresh rate pretty often, so I had high expectations for it. And I got to say, the experience is very real. After about a month of using this phone, I set my screen to 60hz, to see how long I could last with the old refresh rate. The difference was immodestly. In less than an hour, I had to switch back to 120hz. The Battery life on this phone is great too. I'm not a heavy user. Normally, I'm on youtube, texting friends, check emails, etc, and the battery is more than enough for it. I also use Google Maps a lot, and by the end of the day, I have about 30-50 percent battery left.

Overall, would definitely recommend this phone for anyone that is looking fro an upgrade"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I just got the phone, as of right now, it is great! Not exactly excited to have to buy adapters to make it connect to my car for the android auto but, in the grand scheme of things, it's really not a big problem."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's my first smart phone. I like it. I don't worship it and do NOT live my life by it. BUT, it is there when I need it. I love the color, performance and freedom. I like the larger screen size and amazing photo and video resolution. I could not bring myself to pay $400 more dollars for an Apple JUST for a storefront. Thanks Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I think Samsung outdid themselves, beautiful phone, got it one day early. the camera is great, the battery life is amazing, unless you are playing or some screen intensive task. The phone CLEARLY lives up to its hype and expectations, it truly goes above and beyond of what the S20+ was... I jumped from an S7 Edge to the S21+ and let me tell you, it was a huge jump, I can feel it with every swipe. I got a Spigen case armor so the phone is a little chunky now but I rather its like that than it breaks on the frs fall. The down sides of the phone: doesnt come with a charger, doesnt come with headphone jack or headphones, doesnt come with MicroSD card slot. All of those features I knew it didnt come with, its part of the market trend. I bought the original charger at samsung store, I do have Samsung galaxy buds so the headphones I dont mind, I DO miss the MicroSD card slot but I got the 128GB phone so I think it'll be fine..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Glitches with screen hardware. A few months ago went black out of the blue, finally came back after having a tech person check it out. Couldn't find any issues.... now the screen goes orange/green, was never dropped or in water... Will be buying a Google phone next, not trusting this 800.00 tool any longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Got this phone to replaced a 5 year old phone because AT&T is requiring all phone to have HD voice feature. Performance is great. I use this to play Genshin Impact at max performance setting, which is often used in reviews to gauge real-world performance, and it manages to maintain frame rate even after 30 mins without overheat like some other phones. The only complain i have is the under screen fingerprint reader is virtually useless after putting on a glass screen protector, even though the screen protector I put on claimed to be fingerprint reader friendly. There are other phones with newer fingerprint reader tech that can read through glass protector. But at least the face recognition is there for quick unlock."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is very good but can be much better
Procs:
Perfect screen
Very good camera photo/video
Highest performance
Design

Cons:
Absolutely backward charger max 25w, it is ridiculous. It is not a flagship smartphone. Any Chinese flagship has over 100w charger and can 10-100% for 20min.
Can`t find a dual sim/ esim support as described by Samsung. Looks like it will be added after updating to UI 4.0 and Android 12. Let`s see."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is a great phone if your into the Samsung ecosystem. I know this review seems to to be not picky but if I am paying $1000 for a phone it better be amazing. Sadly Samsung did not deliver for me. This phone will push you to use more Samsung products and apps. It got really frustrating for me because I was content to using googles ecosystem. Bixby is not that good and Google assistant is so much better. This phone also has a lot of features but it feels like with this phone is that they stuffed as many features they could without having a cohesive strategy on how they work together to improve the life of the user.

I will say this phone has amazing battery life and the screen movements are buttery smooth. It charges on wireless chargers fast and the screen is bright. However the skin of Android is not for me. I can see why people love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Just a bit disappointed that there was no adaptor, as some persons would not have switched phones for a while leaving them without the super fast adaptor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love this product! Saved my phone screen. Actually does what it's supposed to do (too rare these days). Easy to install after watching the brief video. I dropped phone several times over past 5 months since purchasing this. Had several cracks but when I removed the old screen protector it had multiple cracks in the protector but my phone was PERFECT! Unbelievable. They provide everything you need to do the install and you get 2 so have a replacement. Am buying again. Cannot review the face rec or finger print function as I don't use either. I have never had good luch with those functions even without a cover."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought at least 8 phones from Amazon without any problem . This time the Samsung S21 plus crashed after 4 months and restart many times a day but it self . Amazon can't do nothing for me . Now i should by a new one but no more phone from Amazon . I will buy it in samsung directly. I went to samsung likely i have one year of warranty. They fix the problem"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery life is excellent. I'm getting easily 2 days out of the battery. Great display. Photos are beautiful in daylight or night. My only gripe is I wish it was only 6"" long because any thing over that is tight in my pockets when sitting. Unfortunately the trend seems to be 6.25-6.5"" anymore."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The width is a little awkward with case even with large hands but not a deal breaker. I would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The assurion protection plan is impossible. Don't spend the money just invest in a nice case instead.Not sure why Amazon partners with Assurion as they make the claims process impossible and have terrible customer service that hangs up on customers. See my review of that product for more information."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The sound feature drives me crazy! Why not keep the S8 plus feature. It was easier to adjust! I can hear my phone ringing even though I turned the phone volume down. Now if I'm in a meeting I have to go into the phone settings everytime to mute the phone for a customized time frame. That's too much...a person would prefer to just lower the volume from a touch of a button to silence it!Also, if I'm getting a call from an app I never see it appear on my screen if select notification. I see the message after. They really screwed up with the sound features on this phone.I must say camera is great! Scrolling is quick, but that's the only positive feedback I can give at this time. I wish my S8+ did not break!! This was supposed to be an upgrade. Not worth the money!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's a crying shame my carrier is forcing me to ""upgrade"". I'd keep my Mate 20, which at best is an okay phone, over this s21+ any day, but the carrier won't let it work on the network as of next year. Anyways, the good, I like the display alright... there must be something else, oh, I suppose battery life is decent. I guess it is smooth and fast out of the box, but aren't they all, flagships that is. Now for what I don't like. No headphone jack, and I knew it didn't have one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Display aspect ratio, please quit making these phones look like a remote control. I couldn't reach the top on 5.5 in 16x9 screen, but I could reach both sides. Now I'm even farther away from the top of these sticks. All glass, hate it. Samsung bloat, not as bad as I remember, but still there. I thought the camera was supposed to be great, but I get way to many blurry photos. Fingerprint sensor is no where's near as good as any I've had on the back of a phone. Doesn't recognize it quite often. I'll miss not having an ir blaster, still used mine daily. I'll miss not having sd card slot. I'd love a removable battery, but I know I won't see on here. It's to bad, I'd love to see android phones from 5-8 years ago with modern specs any day over the current line up of iphones wanna be's. This is not an upgrade to me, it's settling for the least objectionable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great product, fingerprint reader much better, as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Overall, a good phone so far. Fingerprint takes a few tries. Battery charge could last longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Came with charging cord but not a charging block. Cord requires a different block that has a type c adapter insead of USB adapter. Now I have to buy a new block to be able to use my new cord. Also didn't come with headphones since they took away the headphone intup adapter and bow have to use headphone with the type c charging cord end. Other than that I love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","They make it so easy to switch to a new phone and keep all your information, photos and contacts. Loaded with features and runs flawlessly. Great battery life and an incredible camera. I scored top brownie points with this gift to the wife she loves it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone has an incredible display and very solid battery life. The camera on this thing is INSANE. I showed several people some videos I took and they swore it looked 8k (may have been shot in 8k, but the S21+ screen is only 1080p).The 120hz refresh rate screen creates a silky smooth and snappy experience, especially when scrolling. With this phone, I was able to take advantage of all of androids customization with the software without experiencing any lag.Highly recommend this over the regular S21 if larger display and battery life are key aspects for you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Long battery life, great screen, good speed.Finger print doesn't like me...but I have several 'seasons ' on me, and it may be operator error!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Functions great some quirks I didn't expect. Battery life not as long as I thought and it sometimes had to be restarted in rural areas as it loses track of signal. But it's better than smoke signals and walkie talkies. Great video and camera features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Beautiful display, very good photos. So far good cellular service. But the fingerprint reader is the worst. ""Upgraded"" from my S9 Who's fingerprint reader worked instantly. To this, that takes forever to learn my fingerprint. And then not be able to read it after it says it's got it. And locks me out, and makes me use my pin."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It was advertised as Special Features as having expandable memory‚Ä¶.but I have not found any expandable memory ‚Ä¶.. misleading"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good if you're looking for a phone that can do a little bit of everything for you such as high quality pictures, excellent performance and even great audio quality (loudness is okay, nothing crazy), there are a lot of better options out there, however depending on the price and how much you like or trust Samsung devices this one will be a perfect fit (I've been using Samsung Products for quite some time and the only one to let me down was a Galaxy Note 3 after dropping 1 time). Definitely feels like a high quality product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My wife got this phone for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It was easy to set up, and my wife says it is very fast. She is very happy with it, and I'm happy she loved her Christmas gift!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great battery, there are times I can go two days without needing to charge. It was easy to set up, took the phone to T-Mobile and the process was done in 15 minutes. The performance is amazing, apps never crash and everything loads really fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really love this smartphone. At first I couldn't transfer my contacts to car so the car never showed who was calling, and couldn't dial by name, then the Android 11 update hit a couple of weeks ago and all is well now. Perfect phone, no complaints, works wonders."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Recell was great. Phone arrived and look brand new. Work flawlessly. Very happy with the condition of the phone. Bought it for my wife and she thought it was too big so returned it. Return was easy and seller was very helpful. Would order a refurbished phone from them again in a heart beat."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I rated the fingerprint and facial recognition medium as I don't use either. But the phone is great. I was replacing a GS10 I thought I lost with GS21+ 5G and then I found the GS10. But after trying out the GS21+ 5G, as I had read, the graphics will dazzle you. They did, graphics are amazing! I was disappointed the 3.5 mm head phone jack was gone and I didn't know no external SD Card support. But 256GB internal storage should be more than enough, since most photos and stuff are in the Cloud. Great phone, love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have had this phone for almost 2 months and it has been working fine until a couple of days ago. I was sleeping and when I wake up and try to unlock the phone, I found that it doesn't turn on the screen (phone was on, and I can unlock it with the finger but the screen remainedblack). Looking on Google (S21 black screen of dead) I found this is quite common issue with the S21 phones, on my case I was lucky enough that after some hours it start working again, nevertheless now I'm worried this could happen again.For a phone this price, this kind of issues should be unacceptable. I have been a Samsung user for years but after this experience I thinking that my next phone will be from another brand"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good phone. Camera is terrific!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The S9+ was a great phone. Unfortunately the speaker that you listen to while holding the phone to your ear was failing. The S21+ might have a faster processor, a better screen, maybe even longer battery life but the lack of the notification LED sucks! You don't know how much you relied on this feature until it is gone. The fact that it would stay on until the notification was acknowledged is a much needed feature. If there is a way of doing this with the S21 line I haven't found it. I'm not the person that carries their phone with them all the time. I really miss the ability to see if there is a message or a email without interacting with the phone. It might be sitting on a table or in the charger and just looking at it from across the room or whatever and seeing a blinking light that notifies a message or email is so much better than having to pick it up to determine if there is anything waiting. A decision made by Samsung based on higher profits to the detriment of the devices functionality and the used satisfaction I am sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like the phone, very nice style and the face recognition is awesome. The fingerprint reader is in front screen so make sure your screen protector is compatible with fingerprint reader.I don't like it because it has not headphone connector, and it has not notifications light indicator or charging light indicator."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Upgraded from the s8 so there is a noticeable change. As in battery life, I'm able to use it up to 5 or 6 hours just on youtube alone, less for gaming obviously. Also, if you are looking for tempered glass protector with the fingerprint reading actually working, I recommend using ""unique"" tempered glass screen protector. Overall, it's a nice phone that feels luxurious and performs smoothly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is very good. Do not like the fact that three weeks after receiving, the price dropped $200. Tempted to return and reorder. Amazon should make a price adjustment for these situations. For the telephone's performance, would give 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Best most amazing phone ever. Cost a lot but WELL WORTH the money. BUY IT. You won't be disappointed!!! I'm still finding the incredible things it will do every day!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is an awesome phone!!! I got the 256GB version for $799 it's a very good deal that was new delivered unlocked over knight and it has a lot less useless pre installed app's that are installed from your cell provider. Consumer Cellular is the way to go for the cheapest and best service available! I got the Otterbox Defender case for it and I'm well pleased with the whole thing! Update: now it's $1049 thank you Amazon for this great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is packed with lots of features and 5G capability. We are getting 100+ Mbps on T-mobile 5G network. The battery life is better than expected. It lasted almost 2 days with normal daily use (web browsing, little gaming, etc.). Wireless charging is definitely a big plus and is very easy to use. It's a great replacement for our outed Android phone. Amazon's promotion and payment plan also made the phone really affordable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Well this is my first flagship phone and it hasn't let me down at all, the fingerprint sensor does struggle with alot of cases and screen protectors but everything else has been absolutely fantastic! The camera qualities fantastic in everything except snapchat unfortunately. I use it for alot of games and other hardware intensive apps and it's gotten abit warm but aside from that it's handled everything great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've only had the phone for a few weeks but so far I am most impressed. The daily battery life is outstanding. Calls are clear and crisp. Display is outstanding."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like my Samsung 21+ phone. It has fingerprint reader & facial reader. I would recommend this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I purchased a galaxy s20 plus for me and a galaxy s21 plus for my wife. They are both good phones, but the auto focusing is a nightmare. I use some apps and scan products, but sometimes I try to scan more than 10 times, and it doesn't focus to the barcode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The biggest failure on this phone is clearly the fingerprint reader. With or without a screen protector about half the time it will give a error saying that the finger must cover the entire sensor or to press harder despite having a full size thumb covering it. The facial recognition is a little bit better but still has a high failure rate of recognition. The battery life is decent enough, processing speed and storage are satisfactory so no real complaints there. But my several year old Huawei phone is definitely better at both fingerprint and facial recognition. Very disappointing product from Samsung for this at this price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it, still learning all the ways to use it, the SG21+5G. NONE of the cases or protective front covers fit. I asked for S21+ & didn't know there would be such a size difference between the S21 & the S21+ when I was shopping. I know, ignorance, not tech savvy, my bad. I didn't return items because I opened each hoping at least 1 would fit."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was at first skeptical about purchasing an unlocked phone because I have never done this before, always went directly to a cell carrier. But with the outrageous prices they charge for a new phone plus all the extra stuff they get you on, I said why not.So far so good....battery life is great, best value for your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I really like this phone the color and the size is great I thought it was going to be to big but it's perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So far, I love this phone, I am getting my emails faster on the phone than on my computer. It is still only been a few days so there is still so much to learn.I have now had this phone for quite some time and I am very halt with it. The battery last at least 24 hours, I have never had it run out in me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","No charger and you need to buy a type c to usb A adapter !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone has not impressed me one bit. I ""upgraded"" from a Galaxy S9+ to this Galaxy S21+. So far, every aspect of the S9+ has been better. I cannot tell any improvement, but the ergonomics have definitely gotten worse.The fingerprint scanner essentially does not work. And that's if you can find it. The scanner is in a random spot in the screen. Once you actually find it, it just says ""press harder"" or ""cover the whole sensor"" no matter how much pressure or coverage I use.And moving the buttons all to the same side makes using them much more difficult. Everything is now operated by one finger rather than being able to make use of your index finger (this also makes screenshots more difficult).I would not recommend this phone as an upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I went to multiple carriers AT&T ,Verizon ,metro ,And t-mobile was only 1 it was able to operate with because it was carrier locked"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything is working as it should, Love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought this phone as an upgrade from a Pixel 2XL. Wow is it smokin fast!!! A highly graphics intensive game I play (Eve Echoes) is really really fast. Faster than my Galaxy Tab S6. The only negative is the battery is advertised as 4800 mah but I actually got 4300 mah per Accubattery so I'm really not happy about that part."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","a well balanced phone and has great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This product is not for me, was for somebody else. But till now there is now complain about it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great features and functionalities. I love the battery life ability."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am not very happy with my S21+. The most significant loss was the camera quality. The S21+ camera is not that sharp and colors are not that bright as in S9+. The S21+ software cannot focus correctly at closer distances and white balance looks a little bit shifted. Another problem of S21+ is the fingerprint reader that would not work with screen protector. The one more bad thing is that there is no SD card anymore. I see only three positive things in S21+ comparing with S9+. There are: 5G cellular, Wifi6, and a flatter screen. If I knew all the negative things about S21+, I would never switch from S9+ to S21+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","In case you weren't aware, this phone has got a flat screen. A FLAT SCREEN. That's right! A flat screen on a Samsung flagship. No more super dumb curved screens. Just terrific. Brilliant even. Other than that it's a nice phone that does normal phone things. Battery is great! FLAT SCREEN"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought for my daughter to replace her s8+.It was easy to set up, and is more than adequate for her needs.It is quick, responsive, nice camera, and allows her to do her Instagram cosplay, art, and photo editing very well.Plays her favorite mobile games flawlessly.Overall great upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Amazing so far. I come off having Hwaei M9 for the last 4 years and this is truly awesome to use. First time also with a flagship phone. Any way I'll be updating the further I use the phone. This is purely an adrenaline indused review.Great product Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love everything about this phone, I upgraded from an s8+. No complaints yet, came brand new in box unopened. If you're looking for a great phone to use that feels nice, has a long-lasting battery, charges super fast, big screen, and awesome camera, choose this one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Definitely a good upgrade if your looking to buy a new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I dont used the face recognition. I use finger print."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am a long time Android user and a Samsung fan. This phone changed all of it!Fingerprint reader is the worst! They tried to solve a problem that does not exist. On screen fingerprint reader is pointless, utterly useless, and does not work! More so with screen protector. I setup multiple times, and keep getting worse!Edit: just noticed this bixby joke cannot be disabled anymore(you could disable in earlier generations). It has access to EVERYTHING sitting in backseat all the time. Obviously it is not equivalent to siri, its just another door for Samsung to collect tha data. Samsung i am soo done with you!!Battery is great but you pay the price by weight, my fingers getting numb trying to hold this brick.Gorilla fingers guaranteed after using is couple more months."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is absolutely amazing, now I go thru a lot of highend phones, the camera..the screen.. the battery.. the feel.. the speakers and the performance is on another level than anything else on the market, the new iPhones can't compete with this phone. This is a Triple GO!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love my Samsung 21plus. I didn't realize how slow my previous phone was until I purchased this phone. Wow what a change.Transferring data from old phone to my new phone was a breeze. Thank you samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So far, so good. Love the phone and it is very responsive to touch and very fast compared to my old S8. No complaints and glad I got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is absolute garbage. My phone, since day one, gets extremely hot to the touch. The battery charge does not last, even when no apps are running in the background. I can spend an hour on the phone browsing the web and lose 20-25% of the charge. I have wired and wireless charging issues, even with new Samsung-branded accessories. My old phone gets a better signal from my carrier's towers (for voice AND data) compared to this ""upgrade"". Also, for an unlocked phone, the amount of apps they pre-load on the phone that you cannot delete is beyond belief. Gone are the days of buying an unlocked phone and getting a pristine install with minimal bloat. Samsung has turned into a disappointment. Do not buy this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Cost $1059 & screen went black while using & was almost fully charged just 6 months after purchase! Customer service no help other than advise to take to a local service/repair store. Ridiculous!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had 17% upon receiving so I did Not get very far with NO way to charge Device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I live in a complete dead zone, so I need calling over wifi and texting over wifi to function (especially when the device theoretically supports it.)My S9+ works great with Wifi calling on Republic Wireless, and Ting.This S21+ with the *same sim cards*? It doesn't even have the option for wifi calling on Ting or the Mint trial I tossed in to see. Not in Phone settings, not in connection info. Wifi calling showed up on the Republic Card, seemed to work, but then my number transferred to Ting so I can't test further. But so far, one out of three carriers? Oof.And Mint can't even get Data *and* calling working at the same time while on cellular, it either gets LTE/5G with a circle and slash for bars, or when you make a call it forces itself down to 2/3G but gets no data. Yeah, I tried all the APNs I could find, Samsung is just incapable of releasing software that works, and I'm not quite willing to drop ~$1,300 after tax on a phone that doesn't do what it's advertised to.Pictures are nice though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So much faster than S7 it replaced. Glass is fingerprint resistant. Face recognition does not work with masks. I don't use a screen protector, so fingerprint sensor works wonderfully. 5G is better than gym's wifi. Happy camper."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is soo good and exactly what I need in a phone, I highly recommend to anyone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My s21 has been working well so far, no problems, good quality! Face recognition can be a bit slow at times but smooth performance and good camera quality. A quality smartphone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","There wasn't a charging box included."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is decent overall, it's a beautiful device. However after using Pixel for 3 years I am clear that the Samsung UI is of no good. They try to make it funky with too many options they you won't ever need, but the simplicity and intuitiveness of the Pixel is insanely amazing.Also, I HATE the fingerprint sensor on this stupid thing. It does not work 75% of the time. You have to find the right spot on the screen, press hard enough and 9 pit of 10 times I have to try multiple times in the hope that one time it will recognize me. This makes day or o day usage irritating, despite good battery life and a decent-ish camera.Not a bad device, but go for the Pixel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Can't complain awesome battery life and performance is top notch"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","a great upgrade from her previous phonegood battery life and camera is very clear and photos look great.bought it just in time for our daughters 2nd birthday."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought my device used, the listing said used- good condition, was expecting minor scuffs but the phone came out practically new, the phone works great have some great pictures and awesome display."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it better than any other phone I have ever had work with metro by t mobile 5g super charging best and also the ai learns my wake up and sleep schedules really great highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","As advertised its a brand new phone, all it had was a scratch on the box. Super fast shipping, best price I saw out there. thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent phone, large 256 GB, very nice camera and perfect size overall."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is a huge upgrade from my pixel2"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Slick phone--Very fast, great screen. Very happy with it. I upgraded from an earlier Samsung--only wished it could transfer all the notification noise settings for texts, applications would have been transferred. Would definitely buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I thought I was getting a new phone. I specifically looked for a listing that didn't say renewed. The description didn't say anything about a renewed or refurbished phone. The box is in terrible shape so who knows what the phone will be like. Paid way too much for a used phone. Definitely returning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The S21 is a downgrade from last years S20 than an upgrade. Also, Samsung decided to be greedy like Apple and decided to stop including the headset, charger, and no sd slot. It also gets very hot, and more expensive to the point where it's not worth it. I use to use Apple products but stopped because of those very same issues, now Samsung is just as selfish and greedy as Apple, except Apple are actually better products as far as reliability and performance. For the same price, the Iphone is actually a better product, but I don't like Apple so I would get a different manufacture, such as the new Sony Xperia 1 iii cellphone. Hopefully the others don't follow Apple/Samsung greediness..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love Samsung phones and I've gotten them through Amazon on prime days twice now. It's the best phone. Cameras are always great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is amazing. Fast, clean, and works really well. It is also great 4G and wifi connections."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It was a very good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone has been great. Had local Verizon store help set it up and has been great so far. Fingerprint reader doesn't work well with screen protector though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great camera, battery and screen. Sorry I waited so long. Keep your old phone for tv, remote control and camera. Long wait but great price on excellent phone. Highly recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it love it love it. Battery life is great, very valuable for the price. Quick delivery and exact product expecting!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Never expected Samsung's flagship Galaxy S line would be this mediocre... Battery get's through the day with a big power saving from my end or 10-20 min on super fast charge. I expected one sim slot, but did not expect it to be even without e-sim option. Camera must be from 2018. Fingerprint reader is quite demanding.Coming from Huawei P30 Pro, I expected 2 years worth of advancement, but alas it does feel like downgrade in every aspect. Wish Huawei still had the google play, Samsung would be hanging for dear life in this market. I think with biggest competitor removed Samsung dropped their game."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have already tried to have this phone repaired by the local authorized Samsung technician to no avail and mailed it in to their Texas technicians because apps constantly crashing and phone randomly reboots. After getting it back the second time the phone crashed before it even got to the connect to WiFi screen of the new setup and it crashed twice in the 15 minutes following that.Samsung would not replace or refund and only offered the option to mail it in AGAIN for a third attempt to repair it.Regret purchasing this phone. I have had issues with other Samsung products and will not purchase another one again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Useless fingerprint reader.No way to adjust the resolution on the camera, wastes lots of space for unimportant photos.Backwards control buttons, moved to the right side.Deleted all sensors available on earlier models of Galaxy.Bigger screen with worse resolution than on Galaxy S9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Got this phone on prime day. It has been a very good phone. Had not had any problems yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Upgraded from S8 to S21+. It's a terrific phone, albeit a bit heavier than I would like. Battery, screen quality, camera all significant upgrade from S8."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Nice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone stopped working (stopped reading sim card after 10 months). The Samsung webpage is dysfunctional, with it impossible to initiate the phone warranty process (tried multiple different browsers, it just sticks you in a loop that looks to me to be intentional, I'll have to find the time to wait hours on the phone some time to start the warranty process).Additionally, coming from pixel phone, I found Samsung software to be inferior to that of the pixel in nearly every case. Phone is listed as Esim capable, but is not in US. Samsung Visual voicemail is a joke , the message app is horrible. There is absolutely nothing about this phone that gave me a better experience than my much cheaper pixel phone.Between this and my Samsung TV which is shoving ads down my face, my Samsung refrigerator whose icemaker freezes over every week, and this completely disappointment of a phone, if I never own another Samsung product again, it will be too soon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My girlfriend love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Other than not coming with a charger it was a smart choice. I like it"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Strongly resent Samsung's decision removing the micro-sd card from s21+! I mistakenly assumed s21 has micro-sd just like my s10+. Would say bye-bye to galaxy phones if micro-sd is not returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Fastest Smartphone I've ever Had"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Overall I loved the phone. Fingerprint sensor was very touchy though. The only problem I have is that after a year and a half the screen just stopped working. You could tell it was working and it would still ring, but nothing would light up. Restarting the phone didn't help. Also, no the phone was not dropped and it was in a protective case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Went from a 7 edge to an S21 plus 5G"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I loved it at first. It worked great, then one day I kept getting messages, but could not see them. The screen is completely black. Cannot do anything with it. I even watched YouTube videos for suggestions on how to reboot it and clear, as they called it (the black screen of death). Nothing worked. I had to buy another phone. This time I went directly to Verizon. At least it is covered that way."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Nice large display,love all the features"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Fast, looks great, camera takes amazing pictures"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Takes super pics. Good size to hold. Crisp screen"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sick phone. Wish there was a 256 gb version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Best phone I've bought in years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","What a joke! I am visually impaired and hoped the phone would have more features to help me use it efficiently. As soon as you turn the power on you have to agree to let Google, Samsung and who know who else, track and record everything you do. I can't even use the voice to text feature without allowing Samsung to record my message!? I rely on this feature and Samsung is taking advantage of my disability. Then Google starts streaming unwanted and unsolicited ads that totally interrupt and confuse me as I don't realize I'm reading and ad. If I spend $1000 for a phone I do not expect to lose all of my privacy rights. I'll stick with my old phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone performs extremely well and is amazing"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone works great definitely happy with my purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love the phone works great no problems."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sadly I had to return the phone. After doing a soft reset (vol down and power at same time), the phone would not get past the Samsung and Galaxy logo on the boot back up. It is called a boot loop and happens on a very small percentage of phones. I took it to the tech guys at T-Mobile and uBreakiFix and they tried a factory reset but it would not download the O/S. I only had the phone for about two weeks before this started happening My previous phone was an Apple Iphone 6 Plus. Compared to that phone, the Galaxy S21+ was unbelievably fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Killer photosAll day battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really a great phone !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone was listed as new so I paid new phone price and received a used/refurb with PICTURES FROM PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP!I like the phone but am very disappointed in paying new retail price for a used phone.The phone's gallery has a neat function and will ask to auto edit pictures which are blurred, correct bad lighting, delete old documents etc. After three days of setting the phone up, dealing with idiosyncrasies and updates, a notification suggested I check out some pictures to edit. They were pictures from June 2021 yet I purchased this phone in December 2021."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelent product!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The youtube apps is not working."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Stop working after 1.5 year. Matherboard crashes. No repair or warranty. DO NOT BUY IT!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","One of the best phones I have ever had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good value"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Like the phone. Disliked nothing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Didn‚Äôt receive a charger with my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love the phone. Works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought a [factory unlocked us version] s22 plus the 256gb. I intended to use this on visible as visible lists this model as compatible.Unfortunately when I entered the imei number on visible web site it said it is not compatible.Ugh.Trying to decide if I should just return it. Unfortunately the price has went up.Ugh"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","What a huge disappointment. After exhaustive research, and saving up to get a what I was convinced, was a quality phone, I quickly realized it was a dud. I tried customer support, and had to reset everything, and start from scratch, which helped, but not for long. I honestly cannot give any feature of this frustrating thing, a cursery positive mention. Call quality, signal, volume, etc etc etc. Quite poor to say the least. It's so buggy, it's difficult to even perform basic tasks without swearing at it. Save yourself a headache, and pass on this one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone itself appeared to be in good order. No scratches or visible damage. I was on a phone call, using the speaker, and the screen just went blank. I was not able to do anything with the phone, not even shut it off. I took it to my local Verizon store to see if they could get it to work and they could not. You're always taking a chance with a refurbished phone. The 1 month warranty should have been a clue there would be an issue. I recommend purchasing a new phone from a local vendor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone is nice. As I'd hoped. Looks and feels brand new. The fingerprint sensor takes 3-4 presses to work. Not sure if it's me or the sensor...Regardless, it's better than my old A21. Think I'll buy a refurbished tablet next."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone black screens and usually you can force reset it, but this time (11 month old phone) it went black and nothing is working. Trash like this shouldn't cost anywhere close to this much."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was looking forward to switching back to Samsung after the one Google phone I had. This has been nothing but problems. Samsung had me take the phone in multiple times because the camera would not work and that still is not fixed. Now the charging port is not working correctly and the phone is not even a year old. These phones are to expensive to have to deal with all this hassle. I'm so disappointed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Charger did not come with an adapterNot sure if this phone is actually s21 ""plus"" the options/ features are not the same in videos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded.
 From the day I bought it the phone isn't working properly. Now it froze and I don't know what to do with it.as you can see from the video I posted. I would appreciate if you help me to return it and get my money back."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't buy S21's. Any model
High failure rate per cell phone seller's
Factory launch was too soon before adequate field testing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Do not get this phone. From day one, apps that worked fine on my S9, crash constantly. The phone also locks up randomly and I have to do a soft reset. When it does lock up, I will not receive phone calls or text messages. Contacted Samsung and the only option I have is to mail it in to them and be without a phone for 30 days or more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","If the finger print reader is important to you then do not buy this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","HORRIBLE PRODUCT.. the speaker stopped working after barely one month of use! This must‚Äôve been a refurbished device that was fraudulently listed as new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the illusion of buying this products they also sell you the need for a case, protectors and extras. Super annoying, my phone lasted a month."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I dislike this phone because it has shut off and restarted since i bought it. Dont buy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","not worth 1000. Why did the price raise up from 799 to 999 in a few days?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Crap, I so hate I missed the return window, my last phone a $250.00 Motorola G7 power, 100% better then this phone, I feel robbed, I really wish I would've bought something else or thought to return this in time, the battery life is trash, charging time is trash, pictures are nice, speaker phone is trash, Spend your money on something else."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Already returned! I am very worried it might explode. Charge speed is super slow. Only worth $400. Don't buy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The product is an eight hundred dollar phone. The item was received without a charging device? Really, I have one charging device in my household. I purchased a new device expecting to be able to use the device out of the box. All bets are off. I received a defective device. (I cannot determine whether its operating correctly)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good luck getting wifi to work for more than 20 minutes at reasonable speeds.

My home network is 1000Mbs and it only connects at 7Mbs. All other devices at the house, Samsung included, work perfectly except this phone.

And no, it's not a router issue. It's a phone issue"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't buy this crap, it has too many issues and Samsung is NOT able to resolve it. Echo's like you are talking to someone in the MARS. Missed calls, nothing is good on this new device i can mention."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery won't last the whole day, battery only last about 6 hours. And the finger print is not that great either."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Terrible purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Complete scam! Even the box was fake!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","too hot
while playing games with this phone, the phone becomes too hot, since the phone is too hot the screen stops responding, your game is lost!!!!!!!!! Tranks Samsung! made me lost my game and waste my time!!!!!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was informed it would be a unlocked phone and upon me taking it to the store. They inform me there's nothing they can do because I was sent a locked phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Do not buy from this seller. Quality of the phone is very poor. Comparing the packaging to Verizon box, it seemed too sketchy and wouldn‚Äôt even let us set up the phone properly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is supposed to have the best camera out there, but the quality is just pitiful. Even worse, if I try to send pictures to my computer for editing, they become even more pixilated/grainy. I'm thinking I'm gonna return this one..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very disappointed, the phone heats up so quickly, just 5 minutes after using it.
My previous phone that I got from Verizon did not!

I would not buy a phone from Amazon ever again!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","not unlocked"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Returned this item. Does NOT work with Sprint/T-Mobile, different antenna, seller did not clarify. Still waiting for a 1700 dollar credit on Amazon card. Be careful when buying phones online!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Loved my phone, the battery life, the speed. Up until it shattered for no particular reason front and back. Had a full case on it the whole time. Very disappointed!!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I want the extra protection plan for my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the in-screen ultrasound fingerprint sensor, you have to choose between a screen protector or being able to use fingerprint. By VERY far, the worst fingerprint sensor I came across"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery dies after like 4 hours of use. Phone repeatedly freezes and shuts down and very slow to load even with full signal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This item is not intentionally unlocked. It is not dual sim compatible. The hardware was nice, but it did not meet my needs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Highly disappointed with Samsung I purchased a brand new unlocked phone that wouldn't even turn on after taking it out the box SMH"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone constantly drops calls and then reboots. Poor quality product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery terrible, no way near the money,"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't work, battery fried in it after 2 months"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Aside from the aforementioned, be forewarned; if you're going to use the phone's mobile hotspot, be ready for the dreaded ""Connected without Internet""."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Pretty much crap phone randomly restarts typical junk, just buy a iPhone instead and save yourself the hassle"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I got a second-hand phone, no doubt."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is not coming on!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Not compatible with TMobile 5G"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So I got the S21+ 256GB for $799. When I was gonna buy it I could pick between 128GB vs 256GB for storage, but the price was the exact same for either. Also when I look now it is up to $1000 for both models.
I don't understand the pricing structure here.
1080p screen is fine, I have to get within 3 inches to see pixels and even that is difficult. You won't notice the screen unless you do phone virtual reality, and I don't know who even cares about that now.
For all other comparisons just look up videos on YouTube they are all pretty accurate.

BUY S21 IF:
-If you don't want to spend over $1000 for a phone
-Want a smaller-ish phone
-Want the best specs and camera

BUY S21+ IF:
-If you don't want to spend over $1000 for a phone
-Like big phones
-Want the best specs and camera

BUY S21 ULTRA IF:
-you don't care about money
-Like big phones
-Want the best specs and camera

DONT BUY THESE PHONES IF:
-Can you wait until September 2021 when new phones come out?
-You do competitive gaming on your phone
-Dont want to spend $700+ on a phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have had an iPhone for over ten years. I upgraded from the 4 to the 8. The only reason I was getting a new phone is because mine fell in the toilet. Rice trick didn‚Äôt work. After reading the ‚Äúnew‚Äù iPhone reviews, I decided to read the Galaxy reviews and was impressed. Thankfully, I received my Galaxy s21 5G 2 days earlier than expected. Honestly, I love this phone!! It‚Äôs so user friendly, and I‚Äôm finding new features almost everyday. I don‚Äôt see me ever going back to iPhone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have low call volume issue and found out that if i hold my ear not to center like usually, but in the middle of center and left edge - then the call volume is ok.
This is a very annoying issue and requires holding the phone in a clumsy fashion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've had the phone about a month and I am happy with it. I used to have a Note 4 so the S21+ is a lot faster. I don't spend much time gaming and watching videos on my phone so I'm not a screen expert but to me it is really nice. The physical size/weight of the phone is about the same as the old Note 4 but without the bezels the screen is much bigger (which is great for aging eyes). Again I am not a heavy duty user so the battery lasts 2-3 days and when I do need a charge the quick charging is a plus. So far I am very pleased with the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sorry that it does not have a microphone jack"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is a nice phone:
* Fast
* Smooth (scrolling is responsive)
* Small (not Ultra version)
* Camera (takes good photos)
* Price (reasonable)

But:
* Not the same build quality as the older phones
* Screen Mirroring is Broken (cannot override DEX desktop interface)
* Slow/Unreliable Face ID (sometimes even refuses to try)
* Flaky fingerprint sensor
* Funky button layout (reversed)

(a) cannot take selfie right-handed using Volume button as shutter, because the power button is on the bottom near right index finger, and volumes buttons are out of reach at the top!

(b) software buttons are reverse order of a Pixel layout (which in subsequent versions, removed all, but one)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","beautiful phone. people complain about the material make up in comparison to the S20. I actually prefer this over the S20. The camera on S21 is more clear, sharp, and natural in colors compared to the S20 photo quality is more saturated. It's all to your preference. I also like the design. Not too crazy about the back being plastic compared to S20 glass back - in the end I just use phone cases anyways.

Only thing I dislike a little is the battery life. Though it takes a few days to optimize, it is lacking. I enable 120hz display which does drain the battery, however, compared to my 2017 Razer phone which also is 120hz - the battery life on Razer performed far better than S21. There is an option to switch to 60hz display which optimizes long life for battery. This is all based on your preference. I choose to have a 120hz display so I expect the battery to drain a little.

Bottom line - I would recommend to ignore reviews who complain about battery life, material, etc but do not provide substantial reasoning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","We really like these new phones, my wife and I both purchase the Samsung Galaxy s21 & the plus thru T-Mobile."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great screen and very good camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't believe all the reviews that say this phone is bad, not worth the money, or a downgrade. The S21+ is a powerful, flagship device. Superfast, no lag, beautiful display, powerful camera. The face recognition is superfast. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the fingerprint reader. It is rather slow and not always accurate. Certainly not a deal breaker. I got phone at a great price after trade-in at AT&T. Love this phone. Best phone I have ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Only worth if you are getting it free as a trade in. Missing items or features: charger, SD card slot, headphone jack, lower resolution, plastic back even tho s+ is listed as glass, non replaceable battery. Samsung is chasing Apple when most Android users avoid Apple for a reason. Two stars are for the 5g and removing Bixby button."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone was working great until 7 months later, the top speaker started crackling...I looked online and its a common issue for all samsung phones! This will be my last samsung phone I'll ever buy and will never buy a samsung again. Garbage pile of junk!! I'm buying an apple iPhone to replace this junk."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I'm not sure if I just got a faulty device, but my phone shut off after 3 months and unable to turn back on no matter what I, and the tech support, tried. My provider ended up exchanging it for a new device (same model) and said that it is a known issue, though rare. Outside of that, the phone worked well and the camera was great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","About time samsung fingerprint face recognition battery life all to great Upgraded from the s10 this is definitely a phone that's worth heads up it run fhd ‚ûï plus no micro SD card so be prepared to backup and transfer using smart switch"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone itself is great! I love it. The problem is it only comes with a charging cord not a brick . So I had to buy the charger separate. It also doesn't have a headphone jack. I paid 1000$ through my carrier so you are getting a really getting a good price.

The fingerprint reader is inconsistent and for me doesn't work that often. The face recognition is decent it not great.

The phone is very fast. I love the fact that I can play real xbox games through their cloud gaming service on my phone that I am really enjoying.

All in all I love samsung phones my galaxy s7 edge lasted me over 5 years that is why I went with another galaxy s phone because I know I will last long."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Doesn't have a plug for head phones. I don't like too use my air pods outside of my house so when I got this phone I was disappointed. Graphics are good though. Camera shots are amazing. Apple is a bit better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","UPDATE!!! 03/15/2121 I got an email from Samsung saying that my trade in phone was not what they were expecting. I even called Samsung to verify that my phone was the 5G because I wasn't sure. They told me it was and that I was good to go. Now I'm Being told that it is not, and that I'm going to be charged $550. WTF is with this company. People need to stop buying Samsung products because of the issues they're having and Samsung throwing us to the curb!!!! Do not buy the Galaxy S21!!! I got the phone on Tuesday and found out today that the Bluetooth doesn't work. I called Samsung Tech. support and found Bluetooth to be faulty. She said that because I've had the phone for a few days, that they would do an exchange. I was transferred... I was told that Samsung does NOT do exchanges or repairs. I have to return the phone and then buy the phone all over again after the return goes through. I set up a Verizon account with insurance, and a partial payment plan. Now I have to get rid of the account, and then start from scratch with another phone. I've always bought the Galaxy S models for phones, but this is Bullsh#t, I'm now moving to Apple. Never again. Bad customer service and policies!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Why not include the charger then how can I charge?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Network cell connections drop frequently. Not to panic, nothing wrong with your Sim card and don't waste money buying new one or time replacing it.
likely a tech issue with SIM Card and Network capability.

Had this phone for 6-7months before without issues.

November Software update killed the recommendation and goodness of this phone.

Your network cell will disconnect very often in 15 minutes; interim user fix would be to switch to slower 2G/3G network.
Pretty sure you didn't buy a nearly 1.5K phone for a 2G/3G speed right?

The glitch is unacceptable; Samsung is unhelpful with customer support; offering scripted resets (which many have tested themselves to reset) with no luck.

Poor service and follow-up."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am writing with 12 percent left on this brand new Samsung. Let me just say IT DOESN'T MATTER which cell phone company you have, it doesn't matter if you have an iPhone. The cellphone companies are flat our ripping us off and they don't care if we know because there is nothing we can do about it. I have gone through 3 different phones, 9, NINE different chargers and two different cell phone service providers. They intentionally make their phones flimsy so you can either buy more of their products, or use your insurance (the fee you pay monthly?) To (again) PAY for another phone. I'm not one of those people that that their phones poorly, my screens are never cracked. Yet a Samsung brand charger never seems to fit into my charger ports. After a while of playing with it to finally get some charge, it'll drop back down to regular charging.

A Playstation costs $500 and it'll last you 14 years until the next generation. Yet they make these cellphones out of Styrofoam and charge you TRIPLE the price, only for a new model with 3 new features and an extra 300 dollars tacked on to come out the very next year. Rip off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Simply bad product for the money, just got it and will return right away. Bad camera, okey screen , no sd slot, no normal Samsung pay (no magnetic strip transponder in this phone , s20 have it), no charger in box, no earphones, phone looks and feels cheap compare to any older Samsung phone ( s7 edge looks like a spaceship compare to this ""flagship"" ). Even s20fe is better than s21/s21plus and has more futures ( s20fe has sd slot, charger, MST - S21 does not). S21 ultra has better screen but other than that also lacking flagship futures. Camera is bad in it too. I had S21 ultra - returned it already, now got s21+ - will return it ASAP. I usually don't write long reviews but I am really disappointed in latest Samsung phones and have to say it loud. I had every Samsung s phone since s5. No innovations in them since s10. Sad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","After 3 months it just died. Wake up one morning with the phone unresponsive. I have abused several phones in the past, this was not one of them. It was in mind condition. Going back to my old OP until I can buy a Pixel 6pro."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was really looking forward to this phone. Sadly, once I got it it really underperforms. I don't remember ever being someplace I did not get a signal on Verizon with my old S8. The S21+ has such poor reception that I can't even make phone calls from several places in Champaign Illinois. I get such poor reception that I have to actively search for a place I can use the internet without Wi-Fi. After getting the phone they told me that wound they have 5G coverage all through the area it's not really 5G coverage and I should just be happy with 4G. Even though I'm paying for 5G. Even though my phone is 5G. They say that when they eventually upgraded that I'll already have a 5G phone. Of course if that's for five years from now I probably won't still have this phone anyway. Actually, if it's 5 days from now I won't still have this phone because I'll be returning it. If I can't use the internet"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is a great phone, EXCEPT when it isn't. Mine often gets into a mode where immediately after pressing Send to start a call it just plays a little tune and immediately disconnects/does nothing! This happens time after time to any number. This has happened 7 times over 2 months of ownership.

Samsung support seems to think that this is perfectly OK. Their solution is to ""reset network settings"". That works, but it also (for me) involves adding 5 WiFi passwords and 5 Bluetooth devices.

First and foremost this should be a phone that works the first time and every time it is within range of a tower. It doesn't. If that happened during an emergency situation I'd definitely sue Samsung for every penny they have. If you multiply this problem by all the users of this phone I suspect that the odds of this happening during a life and death emergency are 100%

BTW, face recognition is horrible. Fingerprint recognition is sort of OK. It often doesn't work and you end up needing to enter the passcode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","There is only two things my wife wants in a phone, To be able to make a call and hear her music. This phone will not play music. I've tried the player that comes with phone and several on Play Sore. Needles to say when wife is not happy, no one is. If you want to use finger print reader you cannot use screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Congratulations to the Xiaomi mi 11 that does have a charger. I bought an S21 and now I have to search the internet for a charger for my cell phone and hope that it does not damage me because I do not know if I buy the original. Xiaomi won them in that they should learn more about the competition or even leave the option of choosing or not the free charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought this phone as a gift and and it came out of normal packaging as if it was a refurbished phone and then within 2 weeks of normal usage the screen went blank and stopped working which proves it was refurbished... I dont recommend this seller... They sending refurbished phones and charging brand new price... I want my money back"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Went to look at these phones in person and discovered Samsung made the stupid decision to, yet again, kill the micro SD card slot. They tried this once before with the Galaxy S6 and it hurt them. For some moronic reason Samsung is trying to be like Apple. Here's a hint Samsung, if people wanted Apple, they would buy Apple. The SD card slot was/is a HUGE differentiation between Apple and the Galaxy phones. Bring it back or lose customers. It's just that simple!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is not worth 800 it looks nice and all but no I could have went elsewhere DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The s21+ great phone I have being using this phone for 1 week I'm ‚Öòsatisfy before making a review and I could say a wonderful experience. The disadvantage with this phone you don't have a Sd card. If you a person that do midium browsing and love great photos s21+ can do well for you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love love love! Got a great deal purchasing unlocked through Amazon versus my carrier's month to month plan AND still under Samsung's manufacturer warranty. Like everyone else, I miss the ultimate flex of expanding the memory via SD card but surprisingly I don't miss the headphone jack. I was so ready to whine about it along with everyone else until I realized, I already only used wireless headphones with my S8+ (yes, S8+). Having said that, Samsung definitely needs to include the charging brick. Get a fast charging usb-c option because your old faithful just won't do it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have been using the Samsung Galaxy phone since the very first one and have had no other phones since then. I find this version to be the easiest to use. The processor is super fast, the camera(s) are powerful and high level, and ANDROID and Samsung have streamlined the OS and user interface to make the phone pleasant to use.The battery life is much improved, but it is still not stellar (compared to, say, the iPhone).Overall, I am a bigger fan than ever!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Having a new phone is a thrill for most. It would be if it wasn't forced down our throats by the carriers. Problem is that id the case and there lies the rub. I digress. The phone isn't the problem. It is just something else to learn and that isn't a problem. I like the phone. I will get used to it. Now that my carrier has it identified in their system, I can maybe get rid of the buggy operation. For those whose life revolves around their phones, this is blissful. As for me, it is a tool. This is a pretty nice tool too!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very upsetting I bought this not too long ago to replace a cheap phone that I'm trying to use as a backup and my sim card won't work for some reason so gotta deal with the carrier. I use it for work and it's really disruptive that this just randomly broke. I protected it with a heavy case and screen protector. I was simply scrolling through a web page when it shut off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've ALWAYS loved android, but this phone is the best one yet!! For starters the battery life is amazing I can be on my phone all day then let my son use it for YouTube and by the end of the day my battery life will be at like 48% or HIGHER! The clarity/color of pictures and videos are so nice very clear and bright! The camera is great as well, has a lot of options for vloggers starting out this would be a nice phone to use to record on your phone! I also think this is one of the best layouts/styles that Samsung has done on a phone to date, it's very sleek!! I LOVE IT and very happy with my purchase!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Every phone I've purchased has been an apple phone and I didn't realize how much I was missing out on until I purchased the galaxy s21+. I love retro gaming and this phone holds all my favorite emulators! My favorite feature is when you hook it up to a television using a hub. Samsung dex mode turns your phone into a computer when hooked to a TV! Best phone ever!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I moved from a S10 non 5g phone to the S21Plus 5 g phone..fantastic 6.7 large screen very fast with Android 12.Absolutely worth the price of this new phone, especially since I use a phone for several years.Received it very fast..Perfect condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love this new phone...great camera fir clear, sharp pictures. Great Battery Life!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it, and was really fast delivery and very good condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like the phone a lot. Very useful and fast. I love the ability to customize and I heard the new samsung UI that is coming out in september is going to be nice enough to replace my custom nova launcher."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Couldn't pass up the sale. This phone is working out great for me. Long battery life is a plus. I'm still finding out all it can do. Love the violet color. üíú"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Should have came with a wall travel charger for the price, but does everything you would want it to and plenty more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I contacted the seller for pics of this used S21+ and he provided those in less than an hour, plus also verified compatibility with my cell service carrier. The merch shipped out the same day and I received it 2 days later. The charge port is a tad bit wonky, but so far no other issues with the phone. And at a price of less than 50% of the cost of a new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My S21 does everything great except make a phone call! I have the hardest time just making a phone call. It's very frustrating that this phone just won't pick up a signal well at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love this S21+. It is really a nice phone. Great pictures. good sound."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really good new phone prior I had an s9. The only thing is I had to buy a part. It didn't come with a new cube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The battery life is great last all day. The camera is good still getting used to it. When I put on the screen protector is when I had problems with the Fingerprint reader."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Amazing device! Doesn't always detect my fingerprint quickly though. It reflects light so beautifully."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This 21+ works great with cricket!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it! Everything is great. It runs smoothly and Good Lock adds even more functionality."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The battery life is not as good as i thought it should be,the phone is a nice phone but if your on you phone for any length of time,you will have to charge it ....the phone does not come with a sim card,or the charger for the wall only USB"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Have had no complaints"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great phone but taking time to learn"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It appears to be a very good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The best smartphone that I ever had. The pictures are gorgeous. The battery life is long. The 5G makes it fast online. I liked the Samsung Galaxy 21+ more than the iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I honestly hate this phone. You can't record with an external mic unless you use a separate app or Pro Mode, and then you lose the ability to use half the modes, filters, and telephoto lenses.. If I knew that at the time of purchase, I wouldn't have gotten it. Awful battery life as well. I honestly regret spending money on this. I would def pick something else if I could go back in time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I'm Samsung Fan & had purchased a dozen for myself in the past 10yrs.. The Galaxy S21+ is over priced for what it actually can do & what you get.. But mine in particular has poor battery life! (I don't do games, watch movies Or do social media applications).. Yet- the battery drains quickly & heats up.. NO memory card slot- just ridiculous!.. Its heavy! The camera is no where near as good as advertised. A step down from the S20 Note & Ultra.. You don't get a power block, just the cord: for $1000, just ridiculous. (One of many reasons why I don't buy an apple).. No Headphone Jack! Ear Buds cause my ears to ring, no matter the quality.. I'm disappointed & Not Happy that these missing key aspects are Not Boldly addressed in product description. Terrible Value! Face & Finger tip reader is just medioce at best.. I Do Not Recommend!.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love the color and in my opinion this is one of the best designs samsung has made. The camera quality is really good! Every poc I've taken looks great! So does the video. The battery last the whole day and charges fast with the fast charging cube I bought. I highly recommend this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought this phone because my pixel 4xl left this world. I was allowed to trade in that phone for this for only 400 bucks so I decided that's fine. I'll rock this till the new pixel comes out. This phone is such a joke, the customization is cool and battery is good. Those are only somewhat redeeming qualities. The face recognition rarely works. The wifi is crap, I'll be sitting at home on wifi and 5g and the phone will struggle to play a YouTube video on 720p. The speaker sucks, and only one of them is interesting. The Bluetooth is unresponsive at times. Also the having two different setups for Android is annoying. I know not everyone is a user of Google. But if I set up my Google account in my android phone. I should be able to delete samsungs apps. I don't want to use Samsung store, or Samsung notes. There's more problems, just don't wanna keep going on about it. Unless you just need a phone. I would not recommend this one. I'll be trading in very soon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love this phone. I pick the s21 plus because I really don't care for the camera upgrade on the s21 ultra. This phone is freaking amazing it's fast and smooth. It has all kinds of bells and whistle. I'm still waiting YouTube videos to get familiar with all the settings and tricks this phone have to offer. I can't see why anyone would leave a negative review. Yes I got this phone off of Amazon and I have had zero issues with this phone. This phone came in perfect condition new in the box. And when I went to register it at Samsung it was all ready register with them and I have over a year warranty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Extremely fast shipping. Phone in great shape and condition. Working on setting everything up on Phone.Would definitely recommend to others."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought it about half years and it is pretty good to use! The only problem is the charge time is quite long, but Samsung is still the best Android phone in this world. Just buy it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's a darn good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I never dreamed a smart phone could cost over $800, and still be well worth the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone works lovely. Just as described"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like my new cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Have not had it long but it is working great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything good üëç"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","this smart phone is really good problem is shutting it off. the volume and on do not usually shut it down, if your fingers as a woman tiny it takes minutes to shut it why they just did not shut down like the old ones its a mystery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Now I know why people like Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone always searches for mobile network. You always have to select cancel. Very annoying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","She said it takes the best pictures. Clear and concise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I absolutely love this phone. I upgraded from the Galaxy A21, so it's a big jump in quality and features. The fingerprint reader works every time and quickly. The camera is great, the night mode is especially impressive. The phantom silver color is beautiful. I prefer prepaid phone plans and had Boost Mobile. Once I got the phone and entered the IMEI, I realized it didn't work with Boost. But no big deal. I just started a Cricket Wireless account and got a SIM card in the mail the next day and voila! Phone service. I keep finding new features to love the more I play around with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is brand spanking new and crisp right out of the box. I'm so happy and satisfied with the product. I got exactly what I ordered and the phone works like a charm. The finger print reader works like a charm and everything about this phone is amazing I am a happy CUSTOMER this seller Rocks. Remember to buy a USB phone jack and / or bluetooth earphones, a galaxy s21 plus case and a 25W fast charger with your purchase and you're good to go, üëçüòäüòÅ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love the phone so far, it has everything I could ever need and the battery especially is amazing. The phone lasts forever and I can use it nonstop for a whole day and not worry about it getting close to dying. Everything works great, phone looks clean and nice, amazing overall."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've had this for a few weeks now and I must say, one of the best phones I've had. I've had an S8 for about 4 years and this was a significant upgrade! I use my phone mainly for multitasking and social media and it only drops down to around 80-90% depending on how much I multitask. It's almost crazy how much of an upgrade the battery was. Refresh rate of the phone makes it ultra smooth to navigate, photos are high quality, and overall performance of the phone is snappy (everything loads immediately).Only con I can think of is the fingerprint reader. I honestly prefer an external fingerprint reader than an internal one that's built into the screen. I find it quite unreliable as it struggles to read my fingerprint most of the time as compared to an external one where I can feel exactly where to place my finger. This doesn't deter me too much though, as I mainly use the passcode as security and fingerprint as a secondary. The other thing I'm finding is that it struggles to read fingerprint with tempered glass screen protectors, even though sensitivity is turned higher. This issue goes back to the fingerprint reader behind the screen situation, but also not related to the phone as there's a screen protector, so I'll end it there.Overall, one of the best flagship phones you can get out there right now if you're looking to get a high quality and high performing phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Did ok limited to 128 internal memory. Ok if you don't a big memory. Watch out it doesn't get too hot. Something was wrong with mine & I returned it within a week. I GOTTA GO BACK TO U.S. MADE"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love my new phone. Needed an upgrade from the s8 and I was excited to see this price. It came in one day packaged perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","First phone purchased through Amazon. Very happy, perfect phone. Have had for a little over a month now. It's got a great battery life and I got a great price. I was worried about having the fingerprint being in the screen as opposed to behind the phone but it works perfectly. I have had it now for I'm guessing 5 or 6 months now. I am so happy with my purchase. I look to reviews before I buy things and I leave reviews. My opinions will always be honest. Hope I can help someone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Exactly what I was looking for"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Last year I was required by AT&T to switch to a 5G phone because they will shutdown their 3G service soon. In Oct, 2021 I purchased this phone (a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, SM-G998B/DS 256GB 12GB RAM International Version) from Amazon because in its ""Product Description"" it said clearly that ""This phone will work with GSM SIM cards like AT&T,..."" It worked, however, only to June, 2022. Since this month (July, 2022) it stopped making or receiving phone calls or text messages. I went to AT&T store. They tried everything until finally discovered that AT&T system doesn't recognize it as a 5G device, which means, this phone can't be used by AT&T 5G network. I thus asked the seller to either refund or replace this phone with one that can be worked for AT&T, but they rejected because ""the returns/replacements period for your order had expired a very long time ago"" - However, the problem didn't appear until this month when AT&T completely shutdown their 3G service! The mistake was due to the wrong information provided by the seller and Amazon in their ""Product Description"" so why should a customer pay for their mistake??!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","This phone is very fast. Has very colorful display, great resolution. The only thing I need is to buy fast charger and see how fast it is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","This is the best phone I have ever used, fingerprint reader very fast, It lasted for a day and half also screen quality very bright, I actually love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Face recognition, fingerprint & battery life are so absolutely good. I gave it all 100/Percentage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","When I ordered this phone it had the number I was looking for and the 5g I was looking for. It was a Christmas gift. After Christmas when we went to T Mobile to change to the 5g network, we found out that this phone does not work on the US 5g network. There was absolutely NO WARNING telling us that information. When we printed out the label to send it back we saw someone else had posted the same experience. I was charged over $200 for a restocking fee which makes me angry as I feel this was falsely advertised and the other poster had only had to pay $60. This experience has made me feel very skeptical of what I see on Amazon and made me cautious and distrustful about dealing with them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Falsely advertised as 5G capable to work on at&t, T-mobile or any US carrier, it does not have any of the required 5G Bands in use in the US, it took me a while to figure it out, with hours on carrier tech support and store visits, finally gave up and returned the phone, unfortunately on the free return, with a $60 restocking fee, which wasn't clearly described either, beware."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","It is smart I like it very much it‚Äôs camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Great phone no complaints"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Camera goes above and beyond"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Very good all fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Open box"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Director's view is awesome."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","The battery life is very short. It's literally melting while I take photos or videos. And it's heating up so quickly. Dont know the reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Yeah, until February 2022. Because this phone only supports 3g on American networks. Now that the 3g networks are being shutdown, this is little more than a fancy camera that can't be used as a phone in the USA.

Update: as of June 1st 2022, Voice will also no longer work on this phone on the AT&T Network in the US."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Hi, this product is not what is stated on the description, it has no dual sim capability, it can have two sims in but cannot work simultaneously. Also contacted a Samsung specialist and told me the phone was not internationally unlocked only US unlocked phone. I would not recommend anyone buying this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","5G does not work with Bell Canada and wifi always sleeps when the phone is locked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Product stop working after two month. They sell me this product factory unlock phone and after two month can not make call or receive call."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","I was looking for dual sim unlocked phone.
This one is absolutely success!
It works perfectly with At&t and sim card from a different country together!
Great camera, great look with my favorite curved screen!
Thanks to this seller!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Love this cell phone. Very easy to set up and use all the features. Takes fantastic pictures!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excellent"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","It works well looks and feels new.. no starches or anything. I'm satisfied. Thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Pros:
1. Order received in great condition. 2. Phone works very well
3. Great camera
4. Nice features

Cons:
1. No charger included in the box
2. Phone is a bit heavier and more clonky than previous models
3. Battery life iffy....got teo full days on the first charge (with music streaming)......now only 2 weeks in and am getting 1.5 days ( with less streaming).

All in all, a decent phone....with a few things to pay attention to.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","As expected, great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Phone is really good. Camera I feel is best. And it is the last ever (maybe) samsung with infinity screen. Pen works (bought separately). Yes and camera, macro is fantastic.
The seler is local Singapore. Item was new, likely from M1"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excellent price, prompt communication, fast delivery. Three big pluses and nothing to complain about - not bad at all if you ask me. I recommend the seller. Thanks so much."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The battery life is not that good. I got a moisture error and it never went away so I couldn't charge my phone. I had to send in my phone to Samsung to fix. It came back within a week and it's fixed, however it seems like a fail that a brand new phone would have this issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Love the new phone it has all that i want and need on a phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","drops calls, needs to be restarted far to often. wifi calling is nice. unless you lose WIFI. then you cant just call them back with service. no you have to restart the whole phone even with 5g service. just to make a phone call. you can still send and receive text. just not phone calls. i bought this Samsung because one plus was getting expensive and not as niche as they use to be. everyone cares about stupid features. just make a phone that works. i don't care about camera that much. i don't care about stupid features like wireless charging or in screen finger print reader. i just want a phone that does what it is suppose to do. why did i think Samsung can deliver?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Great phone but not enough improvement to go from Note 9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Coming from using a Pixel phone, I had hoped that the reception/antenna function might be better. It was not. It also came loaded with bloatware and now the speaker is intermittently failing to the point of incomprehensibility. I advise against this product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Changes from previous ones take getting use to."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","for the price, I expected this phone to come with a charger. It comes with a cable, but both ends are tiny. It would make sense for one end to be a regular USB so you could use an outlet or car charger that you already own!
Instead, once you realize you can't charge it, you are forced to purchase adapters. The least they can do is explain that in the description!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","More battery life for me, this is not cutting out, I'm planing on returning it for the ultra, just because of the battery itself, it's so bad, I think I might have gotten a defective one? The phone is amazing, and the camera is great, awesome sound with dolby atmos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Product came as described and in excellent condition"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Comfortable to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This case fits perfectly and has a good grip feel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Nice phone but, for the price, you would think it included a charger. Or even the stylus pictured in the instruction booklet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Love my new samsung s22"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Great batter life, best camera out there, fastest processor. Order a case with it so you don't risk scratches."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Was hoping to enjoy this phone but learned rather quickly that the battery life is very poor. Just using it to take a few photos, search the Internet, send a few texts, and listen to the radio drain the battery fast. On average, about 10% would drain per hour of light to moderate use. Sometimes in 30 min the phone lost 10%. That is with all sorts of battery optimization and app settings to remove background use, etc.The cell signal avg. 1-10Mbs compared my prior phone on the same phone plan that ranged from 10-400 Mbs.All-in-all, Samsung didn't do a great job with this phone. I think the new idea of these phone companies putting new phones out each year is just a game to generate revenue based on the ""what will the next year phone give me..."" mindset. But, that doesn't really give them time to truly develop a high quality product and/or implement improvements on existing phones. It is a game between Samsung, Apple, and Google to sell the most at each annual launch. Don't launch something and you become outdated. Not a great strategy when you see the countless reviews of these new phones coming out - many with less than ideal reviews."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Is the phone coming without an original charger, original type-C cable and headphones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Do not buy this product, the battery life is so bad even though it says that it battery life is long. It doesn't even last at all, also the nightography feature also doesn't work so well. The cell reception is just as bad, it is so slow and takes forever to load and connect. I used it for a month now, and I can't stand this phone anymore but I can't return it either. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! TRASH, TRASH, TRASH."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The Camara is amazing , and the phone is in excellent condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Could be revised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Looks pretty, upgraded from an S9"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The battery life is a joke watch a few videos and it's at 50percent like that. I don't like the upgrades merged my contacts with WhatsApp contacts I hate that so much and wanted to keep them separate."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Crackling noise started after less than 2 months of use. Phone is unusable now. Common problem with all new s22 and no solution on the horizon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This phone cost me almost $700. In the prome day. Save like $200 Unfortunately this phone the video camera didn't have the high quality they advertised. Very poor resolution and when you upload the video everything comes out distorted. I want to replaced and they refuse because retur policy was expired one day. Advise Don't buy telephones in Amazon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Descent phone with Terrible Battery and Price, Apple 5se is better than this , I don't recommend it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Battery is horrible. Worst phone battery I've ever had. The phone claims to hold dual sim card BUT IT DOES NOT! Do not buy! It also overheats."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Spekers sounds distortion"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I get 2 days out of the battery before re-charging is needed. Some here say it has bad battery life but that is not the case with me. But then I do not sit staring at my cell phone all my waking hours like I see most people doing. I'm not about to waste my life away constantly playing games, watching videos, doing social media madness, texting and calling friends for hours and hours every day. The other day I was a stop light and looked over at the car next to me and the driver was staring at his phone and the passenger was staring at his phone till the light turned green. I wondered if they did that at every light they had to stop at. It was crazy. I am in the sign business and I use this phone for business and personal use making calls, texting customers mostly and friends. I seldom get online with it, maybe 10 times a month to look something up. I use Google Maps maybe 15 times a month for driving directions to customers locations to survey the building for new signage they need for their business. I don't have 62,000 friends to call and socialize with like many Facebook members do. I wonder if they remember the names of their 62,000 friends or if they have even met most of them in ""Real Life"". I have owned the Galaxy Note series phones since the Note 4 came out but always carried them in the Otterbox Defender case with the belt clip. I decided I was tired of the HUGE phablets and decided to try the smallest Samsung S22 that I could get in my pocket, and I now wonder why I waited so long to get a small phone. I LOVE THIS LITTLE PHONE AND WILL NEVER GO BACK TO A HUGE PHONE PHONE!!! I hope Samsung and other Android phone manufactures start making more smaller cell phones. If you waste your life away on a cell phone all day every day then maybe the battery life may not be as long for you and you might want to consider a phone with the largest most powerful battery in the world in it so you can waste your life away all day on a phone without having to recharge it till you go to bed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I want to buy one closer to Android 14 update for 579.00!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from an S9. The S22 has an amazing camera but must be noted that the battery life is sub par. If you are constantly on your phone you get 5-7 hours of on screen time and I get about 5.5 hours. If you aren't on your phone constantly you may get a full day use.. I think this is kind of similar to my 4 year old phone but I would expect an advancement in battery and not the same or a down grade. On a positive note the phone supports rapid charge and can fully charge in about 1 hour or maybe less. The speakers are louder then my old phone which is great for listening to music. I've owned the phone about 1 week and a few times I've had crackling sounds. This doesn't happen daily but is annoying when it happens. The camera is amazing and having the 3x optical zoom and even using the digital zoom at 20x produces good images and there was no way my Galaxy S9 could compete with that. There hasn't been any major advancements in technology besides the camera. I posted some images. Two photos were edited in lightroom mobile. One is cropped and the rest are natural images produced by the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Poor battery life but otherwise OK."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The phone is fine but I wish they would offer a refund for the lower prices"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from a moto z after always being a Samsung guy. I'm so happy I came back after the upgrade from Verizon. 5g works awesome. Great reception everywhere. The battery life isn't as great as I'd like but that issue doesn't really bother me. Great size and not to heavy in the hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Most confusing phone I ever owned...My other Samsungs were easy to work with."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I went from 100% to 91% in 10 minutes of scrolling Amazon and then writing this review. I have had an S7, S9, S10, S20, and S21. Loved them. This S22 battery is so bad, I am going to Apple. Shame on you Samsung for letting this out on the market. The only reason it gets a high rating here is people write them when they first get the phone. Stay away or buy a good backup battery with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I had to get a new phone when my Galaxy S10 broke. I went to a Verizon store and they said a compatible device would be the Galaxy S22. When I bicycle I use an app to follow a route. With my old phone, I was able to use the app and still have enough battery power to keep the phone charged for the remainder of the day. The Galaxy S22 battery my phone loses power in 4 hours. I went back to the Verizon store and asked for a phone with a better battery. They said they don't track battery strength and the previous phone, the Galaxy S10, has been discontinued. Why do they make new phones with inferior batteries?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","In the details section above it says this phone has a long lasting battery in capital letters. What a joke, this is the worst battery in a cell phone I have ever had, period! I would not recommend buying this phone because of the battery, and also the screen is on the small side for today's smartphones. Screen is good, camera is good, but the size of the screen is very small, and the battery is just horrible!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","since there is no more micro sd for extra memory i will no longer buy samsung. just disappointing. booooooooo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Samsung really delivered a poor product with this year's S22 line and the base S22 is the perfect culprit of this. Not sure about the 22+ and S22 Ultra. This review is only for the S22.The S22 has such poor battery life, it's nearly unbelievable that it was rolled into production. I had this phone with POWER SAVING and dark mode turned on and I estimated about 5 hours of screen-on-time with light use like refreshing my email inbox. Without a charger handy, it'll be nearly impossible to get a full day's use out of this phone especially with 120hz display. Watching YouTube, scrolling Instagram, Facebook, or memes will require you to charge up to last the day. I did not have the phone long enough for it to learn my usage patterns as an FYI.The phone did come fully unlocked which is great but I did not see space for dual-sim card use so most likely you'll have to use e-sim. I have T-Mobile and regularly use the S21 FE which has never had an issue with reception. The S22 however continuously lost signal for whatever reason. It wouldn't last long but I may have had a defective unit.Not all bad news: the camera really is great. Clear photos, 8k video recording, the whole 9 yards here. No complaints in the camera department. Similarly, I didn't experience any issues with the processing power (no glitches or hiccups). With Android 12 out the box, it meant that software updates were next to nil also.Size: the size is pretty amazing if you're a fan of one-handed use. The screen is fairly small at only 6.1"" but if you're small-handed, this is the phone for you. Your thumb should easily reach all 4 corners making one-handed typing easy.Lastly, the fingerprint reader was another issue. It wasn't as quick or as responsive as my S21 FE surprisingly. This was without a screen protector as well. I registered my thumb only once so maybe if I had registered it twice, it'd be a different story but from my experience, it wasn't as quick as I would've hoped. Face unlock works super quickly though.I really wanted to like this phone. I had every intention of making this my daily driver but I couldn't ignore that poor battery life even with my love for its smaller size. I want to try the S22+ but I think I'll simply stick with the S21 FE as it's been my favorite phone out of all the Galaxy line (battery size and screen size coupled with near-flagship specs)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This is the worst phone I've ever had. I still owe $600 on it and both the front and back screens are cracked despite using a rubber case. Now there's something wrong with the charging port and it will only charge wirelessly and won't plug I to my computer. I have to find another solution for a cell phone because someone had the bright idea to make a cell phone that you have to treat as if it were an egg.The insurance through Verizon/assurion isn't even worth it anymore. They want as much to replace it as a good used phone. For the first time I'm considering getting an ""eye""phone. Shame on you Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","just a great phone, just keeps getting better. Set up easily"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from the S10 to the S22. I'm not going to lie I love the S10 but needed a new phone. My problem with the S22 are 1 battery life rundown too fast. 2 after paying so much money for a phone I had to buy a AC adapter to charge my phone. Tell me now Samsung !! Why can't you guys at the company give a USB port that can just go directly in a USB port. Come on now that's just crazy! I had to spend more money after spending so much money to buy the phone. 3 Why you guys stop making phone with put the Mico sd slot!! üòí.. Otherwise from those problem phone takes great pictures."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Battery life seems to be good so far. I like the bigger screen. Coming off the S9 there's a lot of improvements: camera, screen, fingerprint reader, battery life and super fast charging. Not happy that for almost $1000 they don't include a plug and they took away the ability of adding an SD card. I guess Samsung is taking a cue from Apple..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","It's overall a good phone but it is not 5G as advertised. Was disappointed with that."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Fingerprint on the front is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Upgraded from a Samsung S8+ and the difference is incredible. This is about as large and heavy a model as I'd want in a phone form factor. The ultra is just too large for me to want to lug around as a phone. Screen quality is great. Battery life is excellent. Very quick and responsive. Samsung has also stated the S22 line is eligible for 4 OS upgrades, so about as future-proof as you can get. Only negatives I have are that it's a bit on the heavy side, but still workable/comfortable for me and the inability to add internal (SD card) storage.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Everything is fine, good phone with good functionality, much more better than iphones, but there is few moments, first there is no factory display cover you should additional buy it and also very poor complication, only cable inside, my device before was galaxy s10+, and that device was really excellent, i think s10 was the last masterpiece from samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone was priced right, it has all the right things that I need on a phone ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","So I loved my S10e but the battery life! This is a little larger and the battery lasts all day now. The fingerprint reader was better on the S10e but not a big problem with the S22+. Went with 256gb. The 30x telephoto is really nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I love that the phone loads all my apps really fast, has a long lasting battery and has a good speaker but the camera isn't the best."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Bought two of these phones, both set up the same, but one only gets 16 hrs of battery life and the other gets over 2 days."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Replaced an old phone that was low on storage. So far the phone has been working well. A lot bigger storage. Can be a little tricky when you try to speak your messages."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Was easy to setup with metropcs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The Good:
S22 Plus Screen brightness is superior, the phone is light, the battery charges fast.

The Bad:
The battery drains fast with medium use. Touch display is glitchy, at times it would not respond when I tapped. Phone gets hot. Touch display didn't function as expected when using the recommended screen protector. Face recognition never worked.

Summary:
In the box I got some paperwork, a usbc to usbc cable, a sim card tool and no charging brick - as expected. Overall I was pleased with the look and feel. The form factor is good in the hand and the light weight won't tire you out with extended use and the bright screen is probably the brightest I've ever seen.

But that's about where the goodness ends. First of all, unlocking a device should be the one function that always serves its purpose without fail but not the case with the S22 Plus. It just did not work well. Fortunately, the fingerprint reader was fine but only after removing the screen protector. After applying the screen protector the fingerprint reader would not respond so I didn't keep the it on. The display in general seemed very glitchy. When trying to tap around within any app, for example; YouTube, GMAIL, TikTok, the phone would not recognize my taps or gestures. I would need to close the app and reopen. That could probably be patched with a software update but this glitchy behavior is not what you would expect on a flagship phone from a Tier 1 company.

As far as how much I use my phone during the day, I'm somewhere in the middle: I use my phone quite a bit for general checking of email, work communications and watching video content via YouTube for about 1 hour a day while at the gym. I don't do much phone gaming, maybe a casual sudoku or the like but nothing intense. Nor do I watch streaming media for extended periods of time. Even with this medium level usage, I would have around 45% battery or less by 5pm, which is not good for a new phone. It's worth mentioning that this phone charges up fast but I prefer a long lasting battery.

The hot running, fast draining, non functional face ID, and glitchy touch screen was enough for me to return the phone. Instead I went with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. To add some perspective with the battery life, while the iPhone may not change as fast, it charges fast enough and by 10pm I still have like 85% battery or more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Face recognition doesn't work most of the time although in setting up I tried w glasses & without.
Fingerprint reader you have to touch the finger in just the right spot for it to work although SETTING up required multiple positions and touches.
Battery life is OK! Better since you can speed charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Great phone. You won't regret it! Unless you are not smart - then you will"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I lost my S10+ in the bottom of the ocean. This phone is better in a lot of ways than the S10+. It is faster, brighter, and the flat screen is better than curved edge.
I bought it on sale for $799 factory unlocked direct from Amazon. No way would I pay a higher price for it.
The lack of headphone jack and SD card slot will probably make this my last phone. A few brands will continue to offer these features to capture the market for those that insist on them and I will be one of them.

Note that even on the 256GB version, the OS takes up 33GB of storage so you only really have a little over 200GB."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Battery doesn‚Äôt last as long as I thought it would. But, longer than my old phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","It's taking me a while to get everything set up as my 9+ this is far superior. I use for business and when I transferred data I had so much more memory left, got the 256. Speed depends on internet, better when I'm home. Love that my windows office files are on here connected with my computer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","So Samsung advertises long battery life but this is not the case. 24 hours is max. If you are lucky. I use this phone as much as my S10+ and the batteries lasted about the same length of time. Disappointing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone has meet its required standard."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I really like this phone. This is my first Samsung. The screen is bright and responsive. The camera is top notch. It has a fast processor. It's a keeper!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am a long time BlackBerry user and since BlackBerry is no longer in demand or will ever be a 5G I decided to purchase the Samsung Galaxy 22+. It is taking some getting use to not having the query board but I like the phone as a whole. It is fast, has lots of storage even though the micro slot isn't there anymore. I have an android charger anyway so not receiving one from Samsung is fine with me. The camera is on point, the phone handling is good. The hardest thing I have to learn is what all this phone is capable of doing. There is a lot to learn. So any past BlackBerry users who chooses this phone might be intimidated at first but in the long run it will be a great choice to make."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Like phone, good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","upgraded from a galaxy s9+
they got rid of the mic jack, no big deal
everything is bluetooth now
no more sd card slot, kinda sucks
updates seem to fix the minor bugs here and there
but the biggest issue with this phone is the battery, i need to have it charging in my car, at work, at home or the battery just drains terribly quickly, tried turning off all the extra amenities like wifi, blutooth, cell phone data when in not using it, but it still drains super fast
my galaxy s9+ still last like 2 days without a charge, I'm lucky if i make it to mid day with the s22+

Update: i can't take it anymore, it's only been a few months since i bought this phone and the battery is atrocious, just terrible, it doesn't last at all, i even did the let it die a few times when you first get it trick to get the battery going but now when ever i hit 10% i have maybe a few minutes, and i mean less then 5 to get to a charger, the thing is I'll charge it fully and take it off the charger and not even an hour goes by and I'm at 85% I've bought the s21FE and will be selling this phone to some poor fool. stay away from this phone if you need somthing you can rely on all day without having to stay wired.
if you read forums you'll see many are doing the same and finding this phone practically brand new for dirt cheap isn't uncommon
it's for a reason, again stay far away!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I like the phone and its camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone was delivered within the specified time, the original, I am very satisfied !!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Love the phone‚ùóÔ∏ègreat deal at 799
Don't waste more on the iphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I upgraded from the galaxy s9. This was a huge upgrade for me and I'm throughly impressed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I have had the phone for 3 months now and it is plagued with problems. First and biggest if you increase in elevation like driving over a mountain pass or up a steep hill if it is used in direct sunlight for a couple of minutes or just look at it the wrong way the water proofing on the inside warps and causes the phone to stop working. The speakers will just Crackle and the microphone won't pick up anything. There is temporary fix that is so stupid it will make you realize Samsung doesn't have any engineers working for them. You have to remove the sim card tray to let the pressure equalize. But at least 3 times a week I have to open the tray to get my phone to work.
Second. The software it is better then it used to be but honestly that was such a low bar its not a compliment. It is just so so far from being a good experience. Things that you can do on any other phone are if not impossible so deeply buried you will have to spend hours to find simple things like shortcuts to turn on the flashlight ect.
There are more but honestly save your money and get something else. Probably the last Samsung you will ever buy it sure is for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","very poor battery life. brand new phone and battery doesn't last. called support and they won't send replacement phone and won't refund my money.
Called support and nothing was accomplished, they are supposed to call me back with resolve on Monday........I hope it happens. I just want what I paid for! disappointing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I upgraded from a OnePlus 6 and so the difference has been huge. Everything about it is better than the previous phones. Samsung just took everything that worked in S21 and improved it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Do not buy if you fly often. If you are a frequent traveler you will notice how the speakers crack after flights. That's because issues due to pressure change. Same thing happens with extreme temperature changes. The only fix is to remove the sim card and release the pressure which allows speakers to let speakers vibrate freely again. Not worth to buy for someone who catches 5+ flights per week. Samsung has not recognized the issue but you will be able to confirm this problem with a short internet search."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I have purchased Samsung phones for many years now, but this phone might be the last one. This 1K phone didn't meet or exceed my expectations for its price point. It is an Ok phone. One thing that I was pretty disappointed is that it doesnt have a micro SD card for expandable memory"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Great Android 12 features, build quality and really good camera. I'm pretty happy with it, though, wish the battery was better (I have to charge it 1-2 times a day, and I wonder how it will perform after a couple years). Hopefully Samsung will come up with an upgrade in the future, where performance would vary just like fps of the screen, to preserve battery. As I had better phones 6 years ago, it's hard to say it's the best phone out there."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Overall good phone but you can barely use it because it has such horrible battery life, after you use it continually for a few hours you will be at 40 percent battery. I had an older version of a Samsung Galaxy phone and it had better battery life than this it phone and it was only 500 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","My first expensive phone and I can't even charge it!! I'm about to send out back just because of this reason. Over $800 and no charger. Super disappointed!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","After taking a flight or changing pressure, the speaker will stop working"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","My last phone was galaxy s9+.its a very nice phone,has 6.2 inch 1440P display.and 4 years later,i got this new Galaxy s22+ which has 6.6 inch display, but only 1080p resolution.When you take a close look at the screen,guess what,there are a lot of pixels!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","With the last update Android a lot of providers doesn't work anymore.
And also problem of speed."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Did not include usb cable as advertised in description"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am a loyal Android Samsung phone user and I absolutely love this phone (and so does my Apple user daughter)! The screen quality is amazing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I purchased this phone from my carrier and it stopped working after 30 days (phone wouldn't boot up). I contacted Samsung and returned the phone for a warranty repair. The phone was practically brand new without a single scratch. Samsung reported the phone had a failure on the PBA, product board assembly and charged me $470 for the repair. When I questioned them on why the charge they told me the PBA was not covered by the 1 year warranty. This board controls pretty much all operations of the phone so if they don't warranty it their warranty is worthless. I'll never own another Samsung device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I've used Samsung phones for years. Must look elsewhere, the lack of an SD card slot is a deal breaker."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am not impressed. I've had my S22 for a couple months and I like the S9 I had better. I hate that it doesn't have a jack for headphones. Sometimes I need that. You can't measure your pulse with Samsung health like I could with the S9. I wish I didn't upgrade"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","When I first got my s22+ I was really enjoying it. Great screen, good battery life, and great performance. But a few days after I received it, the speaker started making a crackling sound and notifications were no longer audible. After rebooting, the problem remained so it was not a software issue. I did some experimenting and found that when I pressed the middle of the screen, the sound was fine. The minute I let go, it started crackling again.

Clearly these early units have not been put together very well. Samsung support is useless and would not offer a replacement. Instead they wanted me to take the phone to the repair shop. Really? A brand new phone and you want *me* to be inconvenienced due to your own issues? No thanks. I returned the phone instead.

Reading other comments on their forums, this is not a unique problem and Samsung has not yet admitted they have an issue. For those that are outside of the return window, their only option is to send it in for repair which essentially means getting back a refurbished unit.

I'd stay away from this phone until they fix the QA issues which will probably be in ~6 months, at which point the phone will be cheaper anyway!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","A lot better than 4G. On my TMobile 4G S10+ I was only getting around 70Mbps download and 9 to 50Mbps upload. With this S22+ this bad boy can go to 700Mbps and 70-120Mbps upload. Very happy with the speed.

I do not have issue with back of walls. My connect is still the same speed. I notice TMobile using 5G NSA, Which is 5G+LTE. I even have the same speed when I go to my restroom with the door closed. Also, both test i have 0 visual line of sight of the 4G and the 5G tower. I am not sure why people test on youtube have such a huge issue. Outside I get around 750-800Mbps download, and 80 -120Mbps upload."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Very nice battery life and camera. So far very satisfied with the upgrade from an S10"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy S22+ as a replacement for a Galaxy S5 which was about 8 years or so old. This new phone has been very good even with a new learning curve for a number of functions. The big issue, battery life, has been great. I recharge it every other day. I will say that I don't play games, stream very little and don't use much data. Also, I do not use the fingerprint reader and that's just me. So far, I very much like the phone and would purchase it again."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love this phone so far. I had been using an S9 and it was starting to act up. There really is no comparison. The S22 Ultra is so much better all around. It's bigger and somewhat bulky though by the time you put it in a case. Supposed to have super fast charging but no wall or car charger comes with it. Just a cable with a C port on each end that I can't use yet because all my wall and car chargers have USB ports. Even my cars built in charging ports take USB cables and it's a Subaru Crosstrek bought brand new in 2019. Seems petty on Samsung's part to not include a charger to fit the included cable. Shame on you Samsung! These phones are expensive and you're acting like a cheapskate!! And that's why 4 üåü review."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone has good specs and good performance and can run multiple apps at the same time without slowing down. For the money it should have a wireless charger (it only comes with a USB A to C cable and no charger of any kind). I also think that for the amount of money you pay it should have 16 gigs of RAM but it has only 8. It's a toss up between this and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The iPhone 13 is more like a box and much thicker while this one is the usual lesser thickness."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","just get it. Cameras are awesome, stylus is awsome, its fast and works great."

I could care less about the decision to exclude wired headphones and SD card support. There's always a work around.I have access to my home server via SSH. (I will never use any cloud storage service for anything ever.) If storage ever becomes an issue, I can upload everything to my home server.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","For the price we pay they should have included a charger and made a better battery usage ratio (lasts less than a day). However except those 2 well knows issues, the phone is great and super fast !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Just out of the blue product stopped working. One minute it worked the next it didn't. Nothing functioned, would not start, plugging it in also had no effect. Cell phone was only 5 weeks old"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone is everything Samsung says it is and I would highly recommend it, but I have a bone to pick with Amazon. I pay an exorbitant annual fee for Aazon Prime which includes 2 DAY SHIPPING. ARE YOU LISTENING AMAZON, 2 DAY SHIPPING! Yet, this was listed as Amazon Prime sold by Amazon and took a week to get to me. I don't want to hear about Covid crap. If you can't ship everything in 2 days like you promised, you should give annual fee rebates instead of raising the subscription fee every year. Wise up Amazon!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This seems to be the fastest phone I have ever used, and that means it is faster than my wife's iPhone 13 Pro Max. The screen and the cameras were a huge step up from the Galaxy Note 9 that I have been using before getting this phone. The only down-side I have found so far is the in-screen fingerprint reader. The one on the back of my Note 9 was more convenient, and I have not yet found a screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader on the S22."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone. Nothing negative to say. Phone arrived on time, new and unblemished. Very happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I got a great price from Amazon and am very happy as I haven't upgraded in 5 years.I bought the phone because of the camera and display size. I can honestly say I wish I had bought the s22+, because I do not need or use the stylus, and the stylus adds quite a bit of weight to the phone.The phone is super fast and the display is incredible. The only complaint I would really raise is that it seems it gets worse 4g reception than my s9+, but does well if it can pick up a 5g tower.I never found myself in any dead area when traveling near my phone before, but it's happened twice now, which is very stange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Very expensive works well so far fingerprint reader is in the screen and not on the back so fancy. I'm 22 and technologically has never been my Forte this is. Pretty simple easy to use phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Well made and high functioning. It has met or exceeded all my expectations except for speech to text and fingerprint reader. The reader has problems with screen covers, even after calibration. Speech to text is not exactly Star Trek but that could also be the online engine.I had a Samsung S21 FE and hated it. Returned after 2 months with the gracious complicity of Amazon. Even when manufacturers and distributors fail, Amazon always goes above and beyond.~JSmith"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I ordered this Samsung s22 ultra 256 gb to replace my iPhone 11 Pro Max because of water damaged . The phone was used liked new from Amazon warehouse . It came with no scratches, everything works and functions like new . No complaints ! I recommend the Amazon warehouse deals and maker sure it works before 30 day period is up to return if something is wrong ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone came on time look and works great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Camera system is great on this phone. Finferprint sensor is fast and easy to use. I play a lot of games on mobile and they look great and phone battery is very respectable while gaming for hours. Just great performance overall!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I purchase this phone a few weeks ago and it's working really well. Everything that was mentioned came in the box and it was really fast to be delivered (less than 3 days and I don't have amazon prime). Had some doubts because I have brought one a few years ago and it didn't arrive and they charge me (not Samsung another brand) When they deliver somebody must sing, consider that. Have a really good camera and it's similar to the S20 Ultra I had for the last 2 years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I upgraded from a s9 which I loved to the s22,totally awesome phone even better than I expected,finger print reader very responsive battery life is about 2 days strong as it was said to be I'm very happy with my purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone, great Features but has a few minor issues that I find irritating but I love this phone.Cons:*Face reader is great until you put on a pair of glasses.*Fingerprint reader only works if you rest entire surface of finger on it.*Battery dies quickly if your a heavy user. watch alot of streaming apps, tiktok etc.*Camera is great but is difficult to master you need a master class in how to take a good picture with it.Pros:It's a Samsung Flagship phone. More features than you probably need but can do it all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's ok device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The price was a lot but quality was a a good deal. Would have been better of it came with a physical manual and a wall wart to charge phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I owned the first 4 Samsung S phones and I`ve always felt like the devices were not very good. And after the S4, I bought other brands. This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G, and pretty much everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet. The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.I bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love the phone and the speed of the apps loading. However, for a phone that costs $1,000 or more, not having a charger is disappointing. If it would have been included, I would have given a 5 star rating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Luv the camera. Not user friendly. Try n take a screen shot...laughable"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It feels so nice while holding it, the phone feels prenium again. It doesn't get sticky or doesn't get fingerprints all over."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bought this S22 Ultra 256GB phone to replace my S10+, which is still a great phone, but wanted the better camera and video, and the notepad functionality is cool. No issues so far. Still need to learn how to use all the options the stylus provides, but the phone is solid. I hope to keep this bad boy for a few years, until the ones that have VR capability that syncs with your brain waves.. LOL. Ha, ha."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Very good phone. Love the quality of the pictures, much better than IPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The media could not be loaded.
 pretty good phone all around. amazing speaker,graphics.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra"," pretty good phone all around. amazing speaker,graphics.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I upgraded from my OnePlus 7 Pro to the S22 Ultra and have to say it blows OnePlus out of the water. Charges pretty quickly. Maybe not as fast as the one plus, but close. The camera is amazing and clear so far. Still experimenting with sports pictures. The phone is very fast and has a lot of awesome features. Didn't think I would go back to sansung, but the new OnePlus with all the issues wasn't worth the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone (s22 ultra) is not dual SIM. Things like this needs to be front page description. Its not enough for me to return but I would imagine its needed for others. Otherwise its OK so far. Early to say for sure. Prob will adjust rating after a month of use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I limit my comments to the use my limited vision permitts. A large, bright. high quality screen. The Samsung accessability settings offer a number of very helpful features including large bold print a special keyboard. and . Talk Back. The phone also permits answering a phone call by pressing to up volume key. Depending on use. battery has always lasted the day and then some. It has been a good purchase continually offering useful surprises as I fumble along."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone was packaged good and is very nice no problem putting in my Sim card or working. Very clear pictures. 5G is considerably fast on TMobile . Awesome phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I must commend this supplier. The phone was packaged excellently, very secured and came as ordered, factory sealed. Will definitely do business with them again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Awesome phone, but I don't like how settings are hidden behind a console. There are basic settings available on my S7 that are non-existent on the S22, unless you download some software and practically hack into it. But all-in-all a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's a really nice phone however, I am disappointed with the accessories that came with it. The package doesn't even have an adapter. Just a USB, how am I supposed to charge my phone? The phone is also quite slow. I am surprised at how slow the phone is. The phone didn't come with the pin to open the sim card slot, how am I supposed to get my sim card in or out of the slot. Just so much I am disappointed in. I've been a loyal Samsung client for over 8 years and I've never been more disappointed üòû"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I came from a Note 8...so this phone is just fabulous and fast!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've been using this phone for a week or two now. Very satisfied with my purchase. I used the note 9 (which I enjoyed quite a bit) and an s20ultra (which I did not enjoy as it was plagued with software issues, mainly issues with Bluetooth and the cameras) and finally ended up on this phone. This phone is actually very solid in terms of performance and stability. The screen is very sharp and bright, the inscreen fingerprint reader is quick, the battery life is average on 75% brightness, the camera is great and the spen is back and as good as ever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone is definitely the ultimate Android phone. Best screen, best cameras, latest processor, and the S-Pen. I absolutely love this phone. I have no regrets whatsoever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Simply the best camera phone. ü§≥ üëç zoom 10x and 100x. Can even capture the moon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","What I do not like, have to hold volume down button and of button same time to get to power down"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Finally decided to make the switch from iOS to Android. Very happy with the decision. Obviously a bit of a learning curve but other than occasional issues with the fingerprint reader, this has been an awesome phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The Galaxy S22 Ultra is an excellent phone with everything, plus the kitchen sink. The phone feels great in my hands (I probably have average man hands), and the fingerprint sensor works faster than my old S20+. The screen refresh rate is at a default of 120 hertz and does drain the battery a tad bit more quickly. The phone can get to 25% by 6 pm with a full charge. If you are a fan of Galaxy or looking for something different from Apple, the S22 Ultra is the way to go."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is worth the money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Honestly the face recognition is not bad at all, in fact its very good, but the fingerprint scanner is so very very bad. I have to try 5 to 7 times to unlock my phone even after I update the software. On top of all that, the sound quality is horrible, I have a Samsung S9+ My S9+ sound quality is way better than S22 Ultra!!!
Aside from all these which I could understand, and wait for a software update and hope for the best for me was the battery which was getting too hot even for day to day tasks, so I sent it back, I expected the best from Samsung specially when you pay almost $1500."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I have used a Galaxy S series for the last 7 or 8 years.. I always got the top of the line every year.This Phone has the worst battery life I have ever seen. To me it was such a problem I returned it, spent $500 to replace the motherboard on my S21 ultra and will use it again. SORRY"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This replaced a Note 10. Loving this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","When im trying to sign documents the pen doesn't work on certain parts of the screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Battery life sucks. I don't like the one side only controls nor the Bluetooth only headset option. Pictures are much nicer than my older version and videos are nice. But if the phone is dead or dying most of the time, having all the extras is pointless because you can't enjoy them without worrying your phone will die."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Everything about this phone is awesome. I upgraded from a Samsung note 10+"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's not much diferent than my previous Note 10+, only hw upgraded, with the latest software upgrades both are almost identical, but it's an excelent phone, i'm very satisfied."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The picture quality from the camera is amazing. The screen is crystal clear and the birghtess I've ever used. The refresh rate is second to none. And being an avid Note owner, I love the stylis being included. It is truly a Note worthy device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone box was not sealed both security stickers were missing phone seems to be good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The screen should have privacy features and the charger cord is too short.and for that price throw in some ear bugs OK (Lol)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Samsung claims 45W charging on the S22 Ultra, but using a USB C test meter, I've never seen more than 30 W. Maybe there's some point in the charger cycle where it hits 45W for a few minutes, but it's definitely not a sustained charging rate. You can find videos online showing that using a 25W charger vs using a 45W charger barely makes any difference. Don't waste your money buying a high power charging brick. You won't benefit from anything over 25W."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I didn't get a chance to try it out . Would not work with xfinity system."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","5/5 best phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I like the photo options"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone but pricey!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","As I Galaxy Note fan since the Note 2, I finally decided to upgrade from my beloved Note 8 to the Ultra 22. I am sooooo glad I did not trade my phone! The Ultra 22 started out promising with zest and a premium feel. I spent at least $200 trying to find the perfect case and screen protector for my 4-5 year, $1271 investment only to have it give me the black screen of death on day 29. I called Samsung who sent me to UbreakIfixit. They pronounced my phone d.o.a. Samsung then played hot potato after telling me it would cost me to have them service the phone. I then called Amazon only for them to try to shift it to Samsung. Samsung had already told me about the 30 day Amazon money back guarantee. The Amazon rep tried to say it had been more than 30 days when I called them on day 30. Now I am stuck waiting for UPS to pick up the dead phone to process a full refund. It has been 3 days now. My local UPS driver did not have the shipping label on day 1. They didn't bother to show on day 2. What a world!

I have never been let down by Samsung before. By far my worst experience with any phone! I am even thinking of switching to Apple now. As much of a Note/Android/Samsung fanatic I have been over the years, I am not sure what to do next. But I am sure that I will hold to my fully functional Note 8 until it dies. It surely has lasted me for more than 29 days!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love yhe phone and would recommend it. The Camera and The Pen are just Amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Red flashing dot appears on screen and blinks. There is no registered 5g service anywhere. Asked for a replacement since I paid in full for this product and it was expensive and supposedly brand new. Amazon said they would replace and I send old device back.
I then received and email explaining that the phone was a high value item and could not be replaced. I could purchase another. However the new one cost $100 more currently and would not reach me in time for the data transfer from phone to phone. Amazon states I need to return the phone within 3 days. However a new device through Amazon would not reach me for weeks. I stated that's not really fair. Amazon states that's too bad and proceeds to hang up because there is nothing else to be done. Bad phone, bad service, bad all around. Still waiting over a month for refund and they won't give it back. Still fighting with them.
Update: still fighting 30 days later for a refund. They received the item back Sept 16th and refuse to examine it or update file so that I may get refund. 30 day minimum wait for them to even look at it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","All I can say is, WOW! This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. Only complaint I have is the phone gets a little warm when I wireless charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Fast, battery life is great, great design, beautiful vibrant display as well as fantastic speakers. Overall a great phone and happy with it so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Fast shipping and absolutely great product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Has alot of cool stuff and can run games very well but that not what I need a phone to do when a need my phone I NEEED MY PHONE TO CALL PEOPLE this phone has too much horse power not enough Battery to handle it!!! Camera is THE BEST the only thing that I think makes this phone worth anything at all...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Connects to 3G towers instead of 5G towers.
Callers get weird ‚Äúout of the coverage area‚Äù message, when I supposedly have full signal.
When my phone occasionally decides to ring, the audio quality is terrible and frequently drops calls.
When I try to place a call, it takes 20+ seconds before it even starts ringing the other person.
Says ‚Äúemergency calls only‚Äù with active service plan.
The digital compass won‚Äôt stay calibrated in Google Maps.
S Pen doesn‚Äôt automatically wirelessly connect for air actions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!
After 2 months the phone started oveheating. Never been used for gaming or anything similar, never has any tab left open, and always kept updated. When this stated the phone will not charge and the battery will be depleted in minutes, charging has to be done in increments and the phone will not charge once it gets hot!!
Amazon refused to accept the item back since you only have a 30days return window, said to contact Samsung or pay $200 restocking fees to return this defective, fire hazard device.
I had many Samsung devices (S4, S6, S9, S20) and never had this happened, I wish I did more research before getting stuck with this mess!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The battery life on this thing is basically the same I was getting with my 3 year old S9, constantly plugged in.

The stylus in place of a headphone jack? Who's brilliant idea was that? It's not 2005 anymore and this is not a blackberry.

Several other annoying little things; during a call, the phone will lock the screen which doesn't allow you to return to the number pad so you best not be needing to type something for your phone call, most of the cases for this thing do NOT support wireless charging, the texts from different people in my life are seemingly all random colors, it's weird af, literally cannot prevent several apps from sending me notifications (like Samsung pay? Who uses that), just all around annoying small things.

Will probably not be buying another Galaxy in the future."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","So disappointed, I bought this for my wife for our anniversary.When I tried setting up the phone, it kept boot looping.So now I have a nonfunctional gift to give my wife and no time for another one to reach my country.So disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Way to expensive to not come with a charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Had the phone for less than 10hrs and the phone has dies 20x times. I've never had an iPhone ever but the frustration that this BRAND NEW phone has caused me is more than I wish to deal with. Beyond frustrated. I don't think I've ever written a bad review, but how isn't that I spend $1,000 on a product that doesn't work?!! Complete waste of my time!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Main camera failed within 6 months. Took the device to Geek Squad, they assessed no damage and cannot figure out why the hardware failed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I purchase this phone thinking it‚Äôs brand new. When I got it, no charging cable, camera doesn‚Äôt work as describe pictures aren‚Äôt clear and then the speaker is going in and out. Not worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bought phone and it came with a broken screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Android still not working properly after all these years. Phone loses signal and has to be restarted everyday. Weak cellular signal when you do get it and just a ton of bugs with the phone. Notifications only work half thr time. Beautiful looking phone, just doesn't work half the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I ordered this used but in like new condition but this phone I got is definitely not like new. Deep two scratches in the screen followed by a few minor scratches. This is not a like new condition at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone arrived too late, so I buy another one in another place and little less price üëÄ"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","If you have S21 do not upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've had this phone for about 4 months now and love it. I bought it because of the superb cameras and also for the 5g. I upgraded from a lg v20 and I'm amazed at the speed of the processor and fast charging time that gets me fully charged in minutes and not hours. The camera is better than I hoped for. The pictures are of excellent quality, even at the 100X setting, although at that magnification a super steady hand or some support is needed. I bought a Doxlion Case Case with Camera Cover on Amazon which has a clever sliding door that covers the lens when not in use for perfect protection. I'm really enjoying taking pictures again wihout the need to carry a heavy camera and hoping I have it when a photo op arises. Samsung is really producing some winners with this phone plus the flip and fold phones. They've left Apple in the dust with their monotonous selections."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've had the phone since March. My previous s10+ that I had for 3 years will give me a longer battery life than the s22 ultra. What's really frustrating is once this phone hits 5% battery you only have minutes to place it on a charger or it will die. While on my s10 it seemed like the last 15% the phone would last even longer than normal this one just dies super fast. I have watched and updated different settings to try and improve the battery life but this thing barely makes it through the day with me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","screen scratches easily. zero improvement over S21. Square edges are I think required by the s/pen, which is basically useless; and the square edges are a hassle and more damage prone. No discernable difference in picture quality. side by side with my (cracked screen) S21, the S21 screen is brighter and nicer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I was really nervous switching from my Apple phone to Samsung. The last Galaxy I had was 4 and it really sucked. But I gotta say, it's $150 cheaper than when I bought it but It was totally worth it. I love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Most reviews say nothing about the improved modem over the past few years x50 to x55 x60 x65 etc.. It is HUGE as far as connectivity to LTE and 5G network bands. Now they are incorporated into the CPU instead separate like on the note 20 ultra and prior and are absolutely monumental for good reception and speed. One of the most important features taken for granted and never reviewed. This phone with series 8 gen 1 has the most advanced CPU/modem to date for excellent connectivity and speed in the most remote places."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is an unfortunate downgrade. I went back to the Note 20 Ultra.

Reasons include:
1. Speaker is terrible compared to the Note 20 Ultra. I'm not alone in this assessment. Softer, less rich, and staticky when pushed. The Note 20 Ultra (I had access to three of them) speakers are significantly better.

2. No SD storage card expansion.

3. Credit Card MST capability removed which means I cannot use the phone for credit card scanners which are still very commonly used.

The camera is an improvement for sure - probably the main improvement I liked. But not enough to offsett the losses, especially the speaker which I use very often. The Note 20 Ultra is as capable except for the camera which only goes to 5X instead of 10X."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","If you liked the S21, this phone is a noticeable upgrade, albeit some of the benefits are definitely subtle.

I bought this series of phone for the Camera, and having gone through a few iterations of the ""S"" line I'm so far very happy with the update to the S22 Ultra.

The caveat. This is a brittle phone. Yes, I'll repeat that. This is a brittle phone.

I would go so far as to say, that if you get the phone and don't have a screen protector, do be extra extra extra careful. One drop on the pavement and you'll be hating life... $1k to a pile of ugly glass in minutes. Buyer be warned..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Cannot transfer ANYTHING to PC. The minute you connect your phone to your PC, it starts charging your phone without giving you the option to transfer files."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I got an overheated phone after texting msgs on fb messenger in 20 mins. Other things were good. Fast delivery and good Amazon services. I decided to return it. This problem made me change my mind. I thought I would re order another SS Ultra 22 but I already have many phones with me. SS Note 10+ it's still a great phone until now I think. Iphone xs, iphone 13Pro. First annoying experience can make me stop buy SS ultra 22 although I wished to have. Next year I will buy Ultra 23."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The year is 2022 and yet the Bluetooth have major bugs. I haven't owned this not even a month and yet it has major bluetooth bugs everytime I use it. The previous phones like samsung note 10+ had way better connection on bluetooth. Sometimes the bluetooth drops down on certain times. The 5G isn't even better than 4G with connection to the internet is slow and sometimes you cannot connect and browse. Unless wifi. This phone is a major let down. I don't recommend unless you wanna pay arm and a leg for something that isn't fully fixed or said to have been made into. Better this and better that. This phone is major going backwards."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Have no idea, why Samsung suddenly decided to remove SD cars from 21&22, I'll will not buy new one until they do understand, people need more space for just watch/listen music/TV shows and the easiest way is just put SD card with Gb of data and watch/listen on demand. Who is in Samsung thinking like a moran? Really sad, will send it back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is probably the worst phone I have ever purchased.
For someone not used to Galaxy phones it is probably fine, but for me the changes RUINED this phone.
Having to turn it on from the side, the new icons, etc... all horrible.
The case is super slippery.
Reception is far worse that my old Note 9+, and sound quality is noticeably worse.
For some reason with this phone my device files (music) will not show up on YouTube music on my Android Auto.
Buying this phone was a HUGE mistake for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bruh I knew all the specs were a complete lie bro. I had Samsungs in the past and this one is no different. I mean 8k camera quality? That doesn‚Äôt even exist. 45w charging? Your battery can‚Äôt even hold that capacity or it would degrade in like less than a month I mean it‚Äôs an okay enough phone just don‚Äôt expect any of the specs to be accurate"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've been a SAMSUNG customer/fan since the Galaxy S III in 2012. I Ordered/Purchased the Galaxy S22 Ultra from Verizon on 3/2/22 with scheduled delivery setup for 4/8/22. Phone arrived and was setup using WiFi/Smart Switch on 3/28/22. I immediately noticed that phone was running ""Mad Hot"" during calls/use/charging (Very sadly reminiscent of the SAMSUNG Galaxy S7 debacle, which I also owned/returned). Next, my new SAMSUNG phone started shutting off and on, at a very rapid rate, by itself. I contacted Verizon, and an exchange was setup, at my local Verizon store. Verizon had endless problems transferring my personal data from the defective S22 Ultra to the new replacement S22 Ultra, due to the defective S22 Ultra constantly shutting down. I ended up successfully doing Smart Switch transfers, at home, using my WiFi. Next, I had to trek to FedEx to return the defective phone. Just after FedExing the defective phone, I attempted to photograph my FedEx receipt, as I needed to get my sales tax on the defective phone refunded....YES, I NOW HAD TO PAY SALES TAX ON TWO PHONES!!! Unfortunately, THE CAMERA on the replacement S22 Ultra phone was inoperable. The Camera App was BLANK!!! I immediately contacted SAMSUNG Customer Service/Tech Support, and a Tech fixed my replacement Galaxy S22's camera function. All in all, not an enjoyable, albeit uber time-consuming break-in period with my new SAMSUNG product. I really looked forward to upgrading from my SAMSUNG Galaxy 9+, but the experience thus far, has been one catastrophe after another. I felt very let-down by SAMSUNG and their product quality control. Now, I only hope that I can update this review with some positive updates."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is a good looking phone but it is very heavy compared to the Note 10 plus. It is also much thicker and not comfortable to hold for long periods. There is no real perceptible performance difference while using.
The camera is amazing and the zoom is unbelievable but in my opinion it is not worth the cost. My Note 10 plus performs all other functions just as well and is much easier to carry around.
Things to be aware of are the lack of SD card slot and if you are on Verizon or ATT you can't turn off 5G without a third party app.
Bottom line is I'm returning this to Samsung. My 10 Plus is just as good 3 years on and I just can't justify the huge price tag for what is essentialy a camera upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I have this phone for two weeks already so far very good!
This is my first Samsung phone.
The Galaxy S22 surprised me, with all the functions.
Before I always was using IPhones.
No issues, fast charging, battery life is great, modern design, beautiful vibrant display, and fantastic camera.
Great phone, happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","There is nothing to dislike about this phone you won't regret it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone overall, wish the battery would longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Do not buy Samsung electronic devices, especially from Amazon. Samsung is a dishonest and deceptive company that makes defective phones and does not honor their warranty guarantees. They do not consider Amazon receipts to be valid proof of purchase, so if you buy a phone here they won't honor warranties or do any repairs on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","ƒ∞t was good experience"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone is glitchy, drops phone calls, delayed texts, and emails. I have had the phone for a month and in my opinion it would have been better to go to an AT&T store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Big downfall is that you cannot screen incoming phone calls
Besides it having an amazing camera 100x zoom and great macro and nighttime camera great photo editing features I think this photo is about average and overpriced."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've only owned this for about a month, but I'm really liking this phone so far. The size is as expected. If I hadn't expected the handful of a phone I may have had other thoughts as to how large it is. I'd say it's exactly as expected though. It is a bit heavy, but the battery is lasting me 2-3 days usually. I'm not watching lengthy movies on it yet so that would probably affect how they last. It's a fast and responsive phone though. It updates quickly over 5G and Apps seem to run quickly. I'm very pleased with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Husband loves this phone! Many features. Battery life phenomenal! Pricey as is the iPhone but worth
It! Fingerprint reader works well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Samsung makes great phones. I still havent used many of the features on this phone but am amazed at its speed to go online. Never used my phone for online before this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone is super cool üòé
Samsung did a amazing job
They're definitely better than Apple iPhone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's an awesome phone. Camera is awesome. Battery could be better but if you set the phone apps properly it'll work well. I really like the S22 altra by Samsung a lot. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I like this phone, it has 5 cameras, you can zoom in a second object from far away, it can open with fingerprints or your face, battery life is good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Does not overheat and shut down like my Xperia 1 used to. Video zooms smoother than my Note 10 plus. Nice moon shots. Love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Perfect for the upgrade i needed was easy to transfer my information from another phone..the camera is incredible more space available to store additional information i needed .....only thing is no adaptor head was available only the cable for charging purposes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","And now it won't even let me upload a photo, says that it is an ""unsupported file type"" even though I took the picture with this phone. Takes amazing pictures, Battery life is ""OK"" it is not as good as my old phone with the same size battery. Lose connection every time I walk into a building. Fingerprint scanner is another Let down, text talk still sucks. So basically you get a really nice camera for more than a $1000. Screen display is pretty good, Screen sensitivity is pretty good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Like my review states my phone was damaged out of the box! I wanted a replacement and was told I had to just get a refund because a replacement was impossible! The phone itself is actually GREAT! This review is due to amazon! :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Amazing phone I bought 2 one for me and my gf. We've never had phones this nice before"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","My son was very happy. Super recommended"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I really liked the phone, but I bought it supposedly unlocked for all companies and it wasn't like that, I can't use it with Verizon and sprint and they never said anything about it that was what disappointed me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","spectacular performance and amazing photos!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Very useful"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","It arrived at the stipulated time, in good condition! It works very well and at good price, excellent"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Excellent equipment. But the screen is already scratched and the original hearing aids poorly heated only worked a single horn. It is cumbersome the process of claim."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I have used the phone several months in which I have verified first hand its impeccable performance.. In Ecuador I have no problem with the different telephone operators.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Returned the same day as the device arrived with the rear broken"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I got the phone but I didn't get the headphones or the USB connector and the article description says they're included."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","An easy purchase, lots of power, construction quality and slot to expand memory is a plus that no longer comes. The last great note."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","The equipment comes renovated directly by samsung. It even looks new. With all its plastics and protectors. The processor is snapdragon. This almost at the height of the new ultra s22 and the truth is that it does not ask anything. And you even save almost 8,000 pesos. It works well with the telcel network. I definitely recommend it. It only brings data cable but. I do not recommend buying the ultra fast charger since you wear your battery. The fast charge even notice that it makes it faster than on my S10+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","He arrived in perfect condition, without any detail"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","The equipment in excellent condition the only detail is that it says it includes auditory and charger and only came the USB out of there in perfect condition everything and is snap Dragon 5g 128 GB 12 ram"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Q I don't cast out complete only cast the device and the Chabl√© to load but not the plug where to connect the charger carnation"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very satisfied."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If what you are looking for is a camera is very good! Now if what you are looking for is a phone it is better to buy it in a recognized store, over here it is impossible to find something that works well!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I can't get the cell phone charger, who I can talk to."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's very interesting how without realizing the battery is downloaded I spend hours with the cell phone and distract me easily hard up to 5 hours using it reading or watching videos and because almost neither do I charge the cell, I usually wake up at 3 pm and just at 7 pm or 9 pm is that I am reconnecting the cell only because it has a charge of 36% or lower"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good team has good camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","That's the reason for the refund."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I come from a samsung j7 (2016) and have this cell phone is so beautiful, it's a big change I like so much, I love that it comes unlocked from factory, I am from Honduras I have Red Tigo and it worked 100% since the first time I put the chip on it, I don't touch to go activating the cell phone and spending too much, the facial recognition I haven't tried it, the print reader I feel it costs you always I have to put my finger minimum twice because I don't recognize it, I think it downloads a little fast, it's 100% I get to play a little bit and I already have it in 97 and a game that is not taan difficult (Beach buggy) , sometimes I feel like it gets hot from the top side of the camera because I think it's because I step stuck in the cell all day and the environmental temperature here doesn't help, when I put it to charge fast charge in about 1 hour and 10 or 30 mints., sometimes I love its way of night is very sharp, the front camera I don't leave me very happy if you in good light conditions you will not look the photo, the cellular is rare, the truth, the mobile is, I recommend it's it's it's it's amazing it's it's it's amazing, the picture, the picture, it's it's it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","New phone, short battery life, directly unplug it from its charge and 98% battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's nice and if you can activate it in any phone company"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The only complaint I have so far is that the battery doesn‚Äôt last at all. It lasts 6 hours and I‚Äôve always had Samsung and they always last a long time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good team."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For now I like it, I'm still testing it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The only thing I could say against is the battery, you have to know how to administer it in the day to day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easy to touch and durable battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Being an industry standar, they should indicate beforehand that it does not come with a space to increase memory through SD memory (neither micro, nor mini, nothing). Also you can not connect your headphones on the computer. Its graphic performance is excellent and its processor is very good, but the battery does not last as long as it is promoted. It is important to know that if you are of those who take many photographs, or download your series or music on the phone, you are obliged to buy space in the cloud"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I sent it for my son to Cuba, and today I was able to send him the charger, with a friend going there."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I arrive on set dates and physically is in perfect condition"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I took him to a workshop because he didn't recognize the line and they told me it was a copy, then they put my line somewhere else and it worked, but I'd like to know someone told me it's a copy. I'm left with the doubt that I'll pay for it as an original."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery, cameras, are great has all the functions of a flagship such as your older siblings the s20, the fluency of the screen to 128 hertz is great, however with the latest update I have noticed some lag at the time of opening the camera application, I hope to improve with future updates, and if or if it is necessary to use tempered glass because with the short time I have been using and emphasizing that I have taken care of it enough, however I already have several scratches and even in the glass of the part of the camera so yes or if tempered glass for screen and camera module!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it at all, the phone is good, it doesn't get too hot when using, it has Snapdragon processor, the camera is good, the temperature manageable. my device didn't come to me with the fault of the fake touches on the tactile so I appreciate it. They got confused by putting 8 GB of RAM when the coming one is 6 GB RAM"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The whole beautiful phone I highly recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought 2 phone and the truth works great good hard camera the battery is fast is perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the cell phone box arrived open, it may have been checked in customs, at least that's what I want to think; all the accessories were there, so far everything goes great with the team. Let's hope that I don't present any problems past the 90 days that gives me Amazon. Rapidly in the shipment, although internally UPS I take a little time to deliver it to me. Thank you"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good cell phone so far. Everything as expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far I have not had faultst, I just have a month to buy it and I have loved everything .. Only that this version no longer has entry for the headphones or to connect it to the car and listen to music and everything is via Bluetooth"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a very good phone facial recognition is very good as well as the fingerprint reader and the battery lasts me for a day or day imedio depending on my use"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The cell phone works great. The only thing that worried me at first was a heat in the battery while I used it the first few days. Everything else is perfect. Intact without scratches. Excellent"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was just looking for a good phone and at a reasonable price. So far all right Thank you!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent product, compared to my S8 I feel a great renovation"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone to be able to play Call of Duty Mobile. I was tempted to buy another terminal, designed specifically for that purpose. But in the end I decided for Samsung by its style that it is quite more refined and because, on paper, its features were similar. A good chip and a good screen with high cup of soda. Unfortunately the phone has had some faults. At first it was software. Problems with Google Play, with discord and now with the reading of sim card. I must restart the phone so that the calling, messaging and Internet services work. It‚Äôs a shame. Besides the facial recognition and fingerprint reading software on screen is really bad. Finally, the connectivity with accessories from brands other than Samsung is quite bad. I have a Xiaomi wristband and the connection between the phone and the band and unstable. I must be opening the mifit application for you to download information constantly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Exheat quality"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I do not like that there arrived incomplete Handset + Cling is missing"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent product"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Problems with the load connector"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone battery quickly wore out even when it wasn't using apps. It was probably defective, but to be a ""new"" phone it's not acceptable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It only worked 30 days. Diagnosis Samgsung Authorized Center - Damaged Logic Card. ERROR OF AFRICA. Now I must pay to return it and they can solve a problem that is not mine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I get the cell phone, but it takes him to high school and they tell me he's not unscrambled, what can I do????????????? Tell me what he bought?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","They reduced the price a couple of days later to the purchase I made. I should get a bonus at least."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","One week after using the phone, the battery does not charge. I will proceed to return :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","An ideal size and new without scratches or damage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","They say it's unlocked from factory and it's not true."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not working with metro pcs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When it arrived very good, within 15 days of its use it went out and it didn't work anymore I already returned it but I'm very disappointed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's no use. It's fast and slow."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I do not like the thickness of the mobile phone, to be latest and high-end, very thick. (Same thickness of the mobile phones in the last 4 years) I did not come headphones, and in the description indicates that they would come hands-free. Something slow in certain apps. Fingerprint reader very well. Easy recognition very well. Battery life similar to that of Galaxy Note 8 (The one I have used for almost 4 years) I will not buy Samsung again, I will try Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I don't recommend you don't spend your money on this crap."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it I get very well as new no scratch sign or nothing The only thing I missed was the connector only the cable came to me"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked it, the bad thing was that I saw him later at a cheaper $80 store..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's pretty good, I arrived in perfect condition, so far it works great, it's pretty definite and it comes well packed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My wife loved this because her previous phone was damaged, she used it a lot so she was looking for a phone that had good battery and lots of space. This one turned out to be perfect for her."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good the phone what owes me are the photos sometimes don't go well from there all fluid although it lacks a certain application as an example to be able to record the conversation"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good fact, beautiful details, its function under water is very useful.Very fast I have not frozen even once in 3 weeks of recommended use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is good but before the month the charging system was damaged and instead of changing the whole phone... they changed only the charging system... I think that if something is not working well. They should change it for a new one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm very happy with my new samsung S20 FE 5G but there's something I didn't find in the box where I came and it's very important to me: THE GUARANTEE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using it for more than two weeks and I have no problem at all. It came from an S7 Edge and the jump is incredible, the battery lasts up to 10 hours of screen with my normal use, the screen fluidity in the 120 Hz is noticeable and makes it generally feel much faster the entire interface and the use of applications.For me it is no problem that the back part is made of plastic as it seems to me that it still feels very good at hand and does not lose the look of premium cell phone, plus it is more resistant than the glass to falls.It has unlambric charge, reversible charge and a 15W fast load charger, which could be included in the box already for the price, but it is not too dramatic.The cameras are very well in definition and quality and in general is a large phone for daily use. Recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Almost 2 months of using it works perfect, meeting all the standards of a cell phone in this range. The only but that would give it would be the weight that makes it a little uncomfortable, but the battery will last me between an entire day of continuous use to 2 days of little use.Pd: I bought you a 500G SD and it works perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","*Review EditedAfter several days of use I can bring you a better reviewStatic Apart:I love the design of the mobile phone, it feels comfortable and looks niceThe screen Super AMOLED with 120Hz is the best you have seen, it is the best you have seen, it looks every color and the fluency is exceptionalThe material feels plastic but I buy a case, although I would not have bothered you all the same way since it is comfortable but for sure I have the case, I recommend you to put a mica because by accident a coin gave you a slight scratch to the screenBattery:The subject matter of battery, many users comment that it is finished quickly when the battery can last all the day even with the active 120hz you only need to update the software, the mobile makes the rest of learning your usage patterns and so to use the battery better so you don't have to worry, you can make your own configurations to give you several nuances to use of the battery, 4500mah is enough for your day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have practically a week with the team and I do not regret anything, I come from a galaxy s8+ and the jump is very good, I wanted a s20+ but after so many analysis videos that I saw I decided for this s20 faith since it does not ask anything for the plus, only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be little in contact with that part. I am going in between parts: it has: wireless charge, reversible charge, mexico, mexico, , it is only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be in contact with that part. I am going in the following parts:It has: wireless load, reversible charge, mexico 865, waterproof, water resistant and dust, 6 of ram, 128 of storage, rate of soft 120, screen Amoled, battery 4500 mha, battery 4500 mha, Charger 4500 mha, Charger 4500 mha, but 15w I recommend you to you to buy one of 25w when you buy one of 25w when you you ask when you ask your order to have your order to have a 25w when you if you you ask you if you need to have to have a super fast charge for you super fast charge super fast charge, since you you charge super fast charge, since you can you can super fast charge, since that you can you can you can you can you can charge, it is no fast charge, that you can no fast charge, it is, it is no fast charge, it is what you is what you is, it is what you is no fast charge, it is the time you is the time you is the phone, it is no fast, the time, the time, the time, the time, the time, the entry, the entry no fast, the entry no fast, the entry no fast because that is what is what is what is what is what is the time you is the entry is the entry is the entry any time you is the entry is the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry no time any time you is the entry is the entry is the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry is the entry is the entry the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First of all you should check which is the seller because for this phone there are like 5 or more suppliers, in the picture the color blue appears but to me I get a pink color, the truth does not bother me but if it is a point to consider.The functionality is good, the camera is also quite good, I think that in general it meets the expectations except for the battery, the battery lasts little in reality, looking on the internet apparently this is normal, not only in this Samsung S20 Fe but in other models of the same Samsung, it gives you approx 6 to 7 hours of active screen with the HZs in 60, for 1 day it reaches well but I think that we all expect more being this a model 2020"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I get the order relatively fast in less than a week, all well so far I hope not to find any fault and return it, until right now it goes well if it is new that seems (come in your box) , finally all well, the only problem is the battery does not last home anything , in first place it takes almost 2 hours to charge to 100% as soon as you turn the battery on it starts to collapse and that I discourage very much, I had many expectations of this cell phone, the truth the battery if it is an aspect of great relevance to me"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just buy it and the phone arrived in good condition and according to the characteristics mentioned in the publication, try with two different sims which were Telcel and AT&T and worked without problems the only problem is that the charger came from the European version but with an adapter there is no problem and respects its fast load."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The bad thing is that it's not so fast in response. Very nice camera capture imagesIf I recommend it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded. The phone came super fast and I bought it for an excellent price $13.500 plus or less. The screen is very good and it does not ask anything to the other models s20.

Out of that I work wonderfully the answer so much that COD mobile game. The sound is very good because it has a pair of louds with stereo sound that makes you have a great experience when consuming multimedia content. The security methods work well, nothing from the other world but well. Out of that I still prefer the physical fingerprint reader that has integrated but it takes a couple of seconds to respond. The facial unlocking is good but it could be better. The cameras are very good and you can record to 60 fps in 4k. The security methods work well, nothing from the other world but well well.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's got the Snapdragon processor, it's 5g, it came in with cable and charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Yes, this equipment has the Snapdragon 865 processor and 5G, I asked Amazon Mexico directly and comes with a 15W charger inside the box. I asked for the lavender color and although a sector complained that the lid is plastic not even noticed, to the touch it feels of a very good and semi premium material that looks excellent and the lavender color looks beautiful. Now speaking of performance, it is very powerful. It runs heavy games with a fluidity that amazes, I have not had any problem of overheating and the few times that it increased its temperature, it dropped very fast. The battery, depending on the use you give it and the fluidity that you have activated on the screen (120 hz or 60hz), can vary between 7 and up to 10 hours of screen, in my case it is enough to arrive at the end of the day (I always have on the 120 Hz and even the Bluetooth and the battery does not drain fast). The rear camera is very good for photo and video, although the front camera for selfies could be better, but I do not complain much as it does an acceptable job."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Without negative details, I am satisfied with the purchase because if you have the snapdragon processor, I had no problem with the network provider"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery is pathetic. The phone does arrive new and with the battery status at 100, it's just that the battery handling of the phone itself is ridiculously bad. If autonomy is not a problem for you, buy it. If you can't be charging it every 5 hours, find another option."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a good option ahun in 2022. As this model has the Snapdragon 865 processor therefore supports 5G. One of the things that most analyzed was the quality of the cameras and although they are of 12MPx the quality is very superior than those of 48MPx, analyze this in depth and I can say that it is worth it. It has unlambric load and is submersible to the water for 30 min max to a prof of 1.5mts. Tamien brings the option of unlocking by dijital footprint which works well dry, while the unlocking by facial recognition is very fast. The audio seems very good to me but not because it says q is stereo if it only counts with 1 hole of the horn... The only drawback is that it brings Gorilla Glass 3 so that I recommend you q you put a screen protector to minimize the one that breaks in a fall. I buy it in April 2022 by 10,100 pesos Mx."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","An excellent phone. I arrive the one I asked for, before the scheduled delivery date. Galaxy S20 FE It is the 5G version although in my region there is no 5G, with snapdragon, and it works perfectly with the Telcel chip in Mexico. It comes in its normal sealed box, its USB cable and charger, and brings its pinchito, but it does not bring cover. I already have a week using it and without problem, what you notice is that the battery consumption is more than the previous one that had the Galaxy A71, and what strange is that it does not bring input for hearing aid 3.5, now I will have to buy an adapter to record the videos with flap microphone. Its cost was 11999 Mexican pesos and had the option to pay with card months without interest."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I came up with 15% battery, in what was set up I stayed at 3%, I charge it at 100%, after 1 hour of just using instagram I stay at 65% only using instagram! I can't imagine using games or apps"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My last cell phone was a Xiaomi, with the same 6GB and 128GB storage features, only that the Snapdragon of this samsung is 865, and the truth is I don‚Äôt feel the substantial change in performance, it feels just as fast. I can say that I don‚Äôt feel that this Samsung is of better quality than a Xiaomi with the same features. Another thing is the camera, the selfies of my other cell had 20MP of the front camera and this is 32MP, I made the comparison of the shots and I liked it more as they went out in my Xiaomi. What I don‚Äôt discuss with this cell is the back camera, it‚Äôs good, but the phone gets very hot when using the camera. To finish, I feel that the battery doesn‚Äôt last long nor because I activated the energy saving mode and I didn‚Äôt use cell to play it, I don‚Äôt have any game in my cell. And for the price, the truth was bought me another xiaomi with better performance, but I wanted to try the samsung for its cameras and the truth is not worth the camera. I didn‚Äôt use it‚Äôs to play, I didn‚Äôt have any game to play, I didn‚Äôt have any game game in my cellu‚Äôt have any game. I didn‚Äôt have a cheap but in my cellu‚Äôs voice I said in me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am frustrated not being able to activate the double sim. I have other mobiles with double sim. And I had never ""broken"" my head trying to solve this problem. Still not able to solve it. Otherwise totally satisfied. I hope someone can help me with some secret or trick to solve this problem."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got super fast, even though it was brought from the United States, all well sealed, if I got it with the Snapdragon 865 processor which is the 5GSuper version recommended"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","5 days ago I got my Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. I was impressed as I arrived earlier than expected. I arrived the team in good condition and totally sealed, with its charger and its cable. I decided to buy this product released since as I understand it comes with the version of Snapdragon. Coming from a Huawei cell phone (and not having access to Google applications) I chose to buy a Samsung in such a way that I had already had Galaxy S3 several years ago. I am fascinated with its screens amoled (samsan characteristic) its quality of image and video, without forgetting its fluidity since it has 120hz (adjustable to 60hz). I find myself satisfied with the purchase, however, the only ""but"" I put it on is... I have read other comments that speak of a ""good performance"" and sincerely by working schedule I have given you a basic use, visits to spontaneous social networks during the day. Being already 5 pm I have less than 55% of battery last taking into account that I almost didn't use it on working time. My experience with Samsung's always his battery is bad and I have done and I have to know how much of it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The cell phone would not really disappoint, fulfills all your expectations is very powerful and efficient, it feels the power of its processor snapdragon 865 and the efficiency of the battery is formidable it lasts all 1 working day of 8 hours without any problem you arrive to your home easily with the 30 to 35% of battery with a frequent use of the device during the day. it allows you to jump from application to application quickly and navigate them without which the device is encouraged at any time, it warms up very little except for the games there tends to increase considerably its temperature but it is not in an exaggerated way. The cameras are excellent and count with a resolution and interpretation of colors very balanced and the night mode is a wonder the photos in very dark rooms takes them out as clear as if it was day. But as I said the mobile phone does not disappoint what is already the state in which they send it, since you have checked the cell phone box you do not realize that you do not protect from movements or strokes to the device box that comes in and totally loose."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using it for about two weeks and I love it! I am not from playing many video games so the Exynos processor is not a problem for me. It arrived in good condition and works excellent. 100% recommended"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I come from an S8 and I was looking to upgrade, opt for this model because it comes with snapdragon processor and 5g compatibility, since in Mexico in official stores only distribute version 4g, in addition to the possibility of memory expansion by means of micro SD has excellent performance, it is very fast and with excellent touch response, the quality of the cameras does not ask anything from the latest models, the battery gives me all day despite spending good time between different applications, excellent purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unfortunately the phone comes blocked by AT&T, it is not unlocked from factory, even when I tried to unlock it on the AT&T portal, I get a message that has plan and has not been paid.The seller attended me and although I sent him images and data did not solve the problem, he was attentive and kind, he offered to return it for refund. I did not return it because although it does not update android nor UI for blocking, everything else works well, it is very good equipment."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung is a guarantee for cell phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I opted for this 5G model to replace an S8+, the size is the same and works well, but I chose the S20 and not the S21 because I had seen that this was the latest version with memory expansion using micro SD card, and it turns out that it no longer has expansion, only the SIM card can be added."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is very good phone, if the correct version arrived (version 5G with snapdragon processor) but clearly it was used because the number of IMEI SV was not in 00 or 01, it was in 20. (This means that it is not new). Also, it came in a box without the original seals. Also, the battery only lasts 6 hours, if you do not mind carrying a power bank with you everywhere, it is a good purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cell phone's the best in the market."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The product arrives closed, completely new and in my case, just as I asked. It took very little time for the shipment although for the price, I hoped that the finishing of the cell phone would feel better, but it is more a matter of tastes."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a convinced user of SAMSUNG for many years, and I've never had one with such a bad phone reception."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I brought in a Galaxy S8 and I feel like I got better with this Galaxy when it comes to the pictures I said were like a professional camera. I don't think of anything."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This version has a functional camera that fulfills.The battery doesn't give problems in the day to day.The screen has excellent image resolution and doesn't lock.The signal of the bluetooth is not lost, I use it with a smartwatch and bluetooth audiophones at the same time and I don't suffer disconnections at any time.I haven't had problems with the fingerprint sensor on the screen.It has fast unlambric charge and I ah pulled out of trouble more than once.It's a bit robust when you put a cover on it, it's the only stick that I find it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked what snapdragon processor brings, the materials and above all the price, what I did not like was what in the publication said 8 gb in Ram and brings 6 Gb. Otherwise it was fine even though I came with transparent plastic seals and not Samsumg and that was strange to me, although it was sold and sent by Amazon from the United States."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quality and price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has the compatible slot for dual sim but does not allow to have dual"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It would be excellent if it were compatible with Telcel 5G network"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My first Samsung cell phone and all great, the charge is not so fast but enough for me, the games how COD and PUBG Mobile runs them to me in ultra HD, gives me 6 hours of continuous play in 120Hz, the camera is very good, as I heard it is the same as the Samsung galaxy s20 Ultra, it does not heat as much as I had heard even being Snapdragon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the design is somewhat dull, but it is what you can expect for a phone of ""high range"" for this price, that if the power and some features are high range but some sections were affected to make the price lower.note: I buy it import by Amazon us and I am happy with the handling of the customs by dhl and Amazon, although OJO before buying review the requirements of its customs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has really been the best phone I have bought, even better than iphones, personally spend many years with iphones, but switch to android phones since Apple increases its prices.This Galaxy S20 FE, has several advantages, I have been two weeks with the phone and it works perfectly, allows me to access it from my PC answering messages and calls without connection problem between PC and phone, takes very good photos, the night mode above all works well.The desktop mode of the phone is perfect for those who work on the daily PC, facilitating us to use resources that we have on our phone from the PC.In short it is worth the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought it when it was on sale with Samsung USA, I'm really pleased, because the color was the one I wanted and it feels so good. Also this version was the 5G version which makes me even happier, I know that in Mexico we still don't have a 5G network but at least being prepared for when it happens is ideal.I'm very sorry that Samsung Mexico doesn't sell it in 5G version.The question of many is whether it works with the networks of Mexico and the answer is yes, it comes unlocked from factory and to me works very well, I have a Telcel chip."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it, the speed with which the phone arrived before the scheduled date, however I think the sound when having a call and putting the speaker is very low, previously had a S10e, and had better sound, the phone is fast, I think that if the phone is designed for samsung's FAN, it should have included audiophones, even if the price increases a little bit, it becomes very basic to me, I think I would definitely have chosen the S20 Plus, it's much better, and the difference is not much, I think it lacks a little bit in the aesthetics and accessories, it is very very basic, only phone charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The equipment is amazing! Very good quality and offers great performance, it is fluid and fast in addition to that its camera is identical to that of an S20+ only that with less zoom (which you do not use so much). It is the best way to acquire this equipment why in Mexico only sell version 4G and with exynos :( but this equipment is the best version (5G and snapdragon) and has a big price difference (I save more than 4,000 pesos unlike buying it in Mexico) The equipment comes sealed and super careful, certainly the best way to buy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It says navy blue but it is lilac. If it is 5G. The slot for SIM and removable memory is the same"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone has good features of a high-end and does not ask much for the normal S20, the camera is very good, the battery if it lasts long the only thing that weakens a little is the screen, which although it is very good the top of the range is superior, I do not regret the purchase because the ratio quality price is very worth"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved this cell phone, it has almost everything that a normal S20 would have, although they lowered a few things to keep a price somewhat cheaper, but that does not mean that it is less, since it maintains an excellent performance in its software (with the qualcomm processor) and in terms of photos/videos, have come out very good shots to me I recommend very much"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A few months ago I bought the S20 plus with exynos and I must say that that cell phone is rubbish. The battery lasted 8 hours in normal use! And 4 hours of screen on. Then I returned it and now I bought this cell phone the S20 FE 5G with snapdragon and it is very different, the battery lasts like 20 hours of normal use and 7.5 hours of screen on (that yes, it lasts that with the 120hrz screen off) but I am satisfied with my purchase. Play PUBG and COD for two hours and it does not heat almost. Then if I recommend it, I have been like 2 months with the"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I arrive in time and form without any topic on it, it works very well, so far no problem has been presented, I have only been with a few days so I can not give a more extensive comment"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good, so far so good. Snapdragon's version is brutal, the battery lasts me the whole day even at 120Hz. The only bad thing is that twice the display touch, it doesn't recognize my finger in certain areas of the screen, I think it's a software problem, we'll have to wait for the samsung ones to fix it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded. I have no problem with the product but it arrived just as it looks in the open photo, that's what I saw when I opened it and took a picture of it. This is terrible taste, I don't know if DHL or customs or what but I don't put all the stars by handling the shipment, the cell phone is super"

This is terrible taste, I don't know if DHL or customs or what but I don't put all the stars by handling the shipment, the cell phone is super"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything so far..but I hate that I feel it heavy and sure that's why I'll change it soon SNif"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am delighted with the quality of the cell phone and its functioning, in addition to being super economical compared to flagship, it does not ask anything from the latter for an average user. I went from a Galaxy S8 and the improvement in performance, battery and camera is remarkable, before I came home with minimum battery or sometimes it was turned off, now I arrive with 50-40%. The but that put many reviewers is the plastic back cover but with a good cover neither notes it and the color is very nice. Excellent cell so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I paid a good price for the cell phone, but I didn‚Äôt find a good case and I don‚Äôt mind not being able to leave it in any soperficie as I‚Äôm afraid the cameras will melt. I also thought that the processor would be better and sometimes it happened to me that the screen freezes with certain aps."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A year ago I bought it, and I'm very satisfied with the cell phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a smartphon that exceeds expectations and excellent quality price ratio."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If it comes with the processor, color, which specifies the publication, met my expectations, it arrived earlier than expected. Qualified and recommended seller."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was very pleased with the size, I didn‚Äôt think it was bigger than my S10. In question I was pleased to work with what you promise, I was able to pass very quickly all my information from my S10 to my new S20 FE. In bad accessories, they already look like Iphon, only comes the charger no longer brings anything else. In time I arrived much earlier than expected, that‚Äôs a great detail."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unfortunately the device that came to me is not 5G, it's just the basic version, I give it 4 stars for that, but really the device is very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Although in the name of the product it claims to be the American version, this comes with an Exynos processor. It is not the Snapdragon 888. Very careful."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought it with Cyber Monday‚Äôs offer, arrived two days earlier than expected. If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this equipment you should definitely purchase it on Amazon, apart from being cheaper, it‚Äôs the American version with Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that compared to the Exynos of the international version offers more battery and better performance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I arrived sealed and if it works with chip from Mexico, in fact, in the box it says that it is unlocked by Samsung. I barely have 1 day with it and it has worked well, the shipment did not take long to arrive, it arrived in 3 days. Very safe, although it should also be bought a cover because it does not come included in the box, but out of that everything well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent equipment quality, the only drawback is that when imported it was opened in customs upon arrival in Mexico. But I fully understand that it was not the seller‚Äôs problem. Even though I arrived open with all the loose contents outside the samsung box everything arrived in good condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cellular in perfect condition, only packaging not very good, but all good. Something late to receive the product, perhaps by the distances from place to place."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It didn't come sealed but I guess because customs opened the package, the phone if it's the right one and it works perfectly so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The cell phone came in closed box completely new, I ah run without any problem and it is original with snapdragon and 5g, although in Mexico we do not yet have line 5g is already ready to receive it, I ah run with telcel and AT&T no problem"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It took me a long time to get there, it took me time to get out of customs and I arrived without hearing aids, from there to outside excellent equipment totally new, sealed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn't like getting a charger where in Mexico. You don't use those contacts."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed it with snapdragon as it says in the pens and it comes with exynos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I arrived in good condition and weather but according to this it was the s20 fe 5g with snapdragon processor and I came with version ecxynos 4g . Put well your ads allo that sell I could not return it anymore because it was a gift . And no way to remove it from the person who has it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No problems with the package, it came fully sealed and goes to perfection. Recommended for the price of the snapdragon version, it is more expensive in telcel with everything and they sell the exynos version ..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone I have had since January and I must say that it has not disappointed me a bit! The camera is very good and there are no faults with the cellular collectivity. 100% I recommend the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's one of the phones with the best ""cality-price"" ratio, however I had to return it, mainly because of its ghost touch problems on the screen, not everyone has this detail and in some it is more evident than in others, however in my case it was annoying that using 2 or more fingers on the phone (like writing or playing) suddenly makes unwanted touches on the screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's an excellent phone, if you've used samsung brand phones before."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The equipment is very nice, the truth is you don't feel the plastic finish, the performance is very good and the photos you take are very good, the camera has flexibility which makes you have to learn various modes of capture."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone arrived from USA earlier than expected. Although it did not arrive in the best packing conditions, the equipment was completely sealed. So far it has extraordinary performance, especially with snapdragon. The battery, great! has long duration and is charged quickly. 100% recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it doesn't reach the normal s20, but for the price it's fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The one I asked for really came, although there are still no 5G in Mexico I bought it for the performance of Snapdragon 865 and the phone in general. I only used it one day but it feels excellent and came well protected despite having come out from the USA, recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Incredible phone quality ratio prices, I decided to leave Apple to try Android and the truth the S20FE 5g left me more than satisfied"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent, beautiful and very fast, met my expectations, no problem with the sign in Mexico, unlocked and everything perfect, unfortunately it does not bring a cover like the version sold in Mexico, it arrived in 5 days from the USA very well packed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its charge is too slow, I tried with 6 realme charger but also very slow load more than 2 hours connected using the phone and it does not charge nor 80"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The cell phone works very well but it came with a defect in the ignition button that came loose and over time it ended falling and I no longer have ignition button"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","At first I had doubt to buy it for Mx but I do not regret it, It is an excellent equipment and more for the price you pay for it. I do not regret the purchase and it works at 100%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I tried it with att and it worked without any problem, everything is configurable to Spanish. So far everything works well. The 5g is a nice extra since we still do not have networks 5g"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All excellent but came without audiophones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone. I love it. Design, hardware and software are great. Of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made. Maybe the only criticism would be a little bit of cameras. But for the price they‚Äôre fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The delivery was super fast, in 3 days I was in my house. I could get it at a super price thanks to the offers of black Friday. Highly recommended, fast and with a high quality camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","16 months of cell phone use and one day the sim card detector stopped working, I went to a center of attention and they told me that maybe someone blocked it for a report of theft, bad and bad with my cell phone that worked well but it broke down as if it had an expiration date."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","very good product, meets the expectations, of very good quality. the delivery ahead of schedule, without any blow or damage to the box, everything in order."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone comes in perfect condition, the box where they send it comes a little big but it has bubble protection apart I got 2 days ahead of schedule Excellent purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works wonderfully, its design is very elegant and the quality of the photographs are excellent. I am very happy with this device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The publication mentions that it is the 5 G that with Snapdragon as well as the reviews that mention that they have arrived, but unfortunately of me is the version and European with Movistar because of what Exinos owns, the team has come to me well only the annoyance is that they are not sincere or they hang to sell versions that are not, of the team works with the details of the Exinos processor that heats up when you use it, from there on out everything is fine apparently with the cell phone, and the purchase then a great nuisance for giving something that you did not ask, luck with their purchases and hope that they do not waste their time making the return of the product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got super fast to Mexico, in addition to having a good price. The cell phone is excellent, what I loved most was the camera. I give it a rating of 10."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In my case I still don‚Äôt have a year with this Samsung S20 FE 5G phone and the switch on and off has already gone off for no reason. I‚Äôve really taken care of it a lot of falls and abuse, even the original Samsung cover I bought for more protection, which indicates that the malfunction comes from factory. Even more careful when buying the version of USA because for the warranty neither Samsung Mexico (manufacturer) nor Amazon Mexico (seller) want to take responsibility. I was very disappointed by both companies, I‚Äôm not going to buy Samsung electronics again and less in Amazon Mexico."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works perfectly with Telcel in Mexico, good high-end phone with good capabilities at an acceptable price. It arrived in less than a week."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got the product right, well taken care of.. only that I came open the cell phone box but if it included everything, this is cable charger bucket and the cell phone, not like that hearing aids or case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It arrived before the date which is appreciated, the device works well, it is 5G, Snapdragon processor, without flaws with telcel. I hope I have no flaws, I will update after trying it a time, until now excellent."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved this cell phone. It takes very nice pictures, it doesn‚Äôt get hot at all and for what I need it‚Äôs super. I‚Äôm very satisfied."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got in time and shape, heron right now. I didn't have any problems with the team."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent production, only didn't bring much protection to the box, but it arrived without problem. I entered Telcel chip."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone. I came from a Galaxy S9 and felt the difference. Great battery, super powerful performance, great camera and very good screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super good product. It works with att in Mexico and goes very well. The camera is not of the best but it is quite decent and acceptable"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone, the box came open but I think it was because it's export and customs sees it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very disappointed, in one of the questions that they ask the seller they ask him if he is dual sim and he says yes. I needed a dual sim team and I encouraged myself to buy it. When he arrives, it turns out that if he has the two tickets to place the sim, however it is only functional one of them. When I started to investigate, it turns out that in the USA dual sim teams are forbidden and so no team coming from there will be dual sim. I need the phone for the job and I don‚Äôt have time to return it. But I‚Äôm definitely not happy with the product and I feel scammed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A complete cellular being of high mid-end the truth goes more to high than medium. The photos are very good and the battery holds me all day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really liked the cell phone the pictures go super well, it was a great purchase, and I got super fast"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn't have any problems and I arrived 2 days before the date to Cancun, everything excellent... I arrived sealed and complete...thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent team, very fast and powerful, having 5G is a plus waiting for it to arrive in Mexico soon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good phone in performance and price is one of the best, the 5G version is better than the one sold in Mexico by its snapdragon processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent team, came faster than expected, is the Snapdragon version at an incredible price, thanks Amazon USA"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The product arrived in good condition even days before what the app told me. It works well I recommend it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No billing I have days requesting the and I have no answer Also the proximity sensor is failing when I am with a call is turned on and off even though I have it in my ear or with the barely speakers!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like great product, but I had to pay 2800 in taxes"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The screen freezes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Mr. AmazonOn August 2nd of this year I bought a Samsung Galaxy S21+ smartphone in LA, USA, which presents faults in the QR code reader. I have made the diagnosis with Samsung Technical Support here in Lima Peru, where I reside. Samsung's opinion is that I request the warranty from you, or else that I take it to Samsung Technical Service to assess the problem and see if it is fixed.I will thank you for your comments, considering that it is a new team and everything should work.It should be specified that the team has not suffered any damage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have about 2 months of use and that mobile beauty, before buying it I had planned to buy an iPhone 12 pro, but the iPhone for its features and price was very expensive, however when I bought the s21 plus was at 799, a better price compared"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought S21+. The 256gb black and 128gb silver. Both work excellent. I changed from Huawei P20 pro, and you notice quite the difference in speed.The camera is perfect and the battery lasts quite long.The price at the time of purchase was $799 each. Honestly worth the investment.And it comes unlocked.It works in perfect Panama.If you have an old cell phone of more than 3 or 4 years, you will notice the difference in speed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","For the price it is better to buy the normal s21 as there is not much difference more than the size of the screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was doubtful about buying the equipment because of the customs issue, but I must say that I received it without problems and it worked with the network of Mexico in my Movistar case, the vdd was a drastic change from having a galaxy s9 to this new one, which I liked the duration of the battery, very happy and I got much cheaper than buying it directly the samsung store"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It doesn't just carry the rest of the cable right."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It works smoothly in Venezuela"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Hello it was a gift, when I got there I wrapped it and I didn't get the phone charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's nice, but the load is bad and besides it gets very hot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything perfect, everything worked very well I bought unlocked to use in Ecuador and everything is perfect so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So far all well is snapdragon and it is very good in battery consumption"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The battery lasts all day, the camera goodisima, should specify that this model does not bring double sim"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It seems to me with Samsung phones are good and the photos are beautiful."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is very complete."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I really liked the battery lasts a long time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love it, the best is samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought the 256 GB American version, and I brought it to my country, Ecuador, the phone 8 days in use, was automatically restarted and what was lit was frozen the screen (it stayed on) and it got hot and I could not turn it off or manipulate it, when I could restart the phone did not re-ignition, total disappointment with the computer, had many expectations. The phone never fell or mojo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Open box And says it's not open"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It really cost me to get my fingerprint. I'm sorry about this inconsistent phone and the super bad signal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent product, however like everything else, has its pro and contra. Very good audio, acceptable screen although to download it to Full HD if it is something absurd, perfect speed, as was to be expected from a Samsung cell phone, a great cell phone and more if it is worth 800usd (how to buy it) Do not include charger or hearing aids if it is something that affects, even if you already have one and the camera, I feel that it may have improved a little more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I can activate it in Mexico"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's excellent."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought it for a gift and he loved it!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Small"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The camera is good but it is not super woo!The only good thing is the night mode :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had doubts if I bought it by Amazon USA, but I decided to do it for the price and for the type of processor (Snapdragon) and I was satisfied. Great phone.I had a small unexpected at the time of receiving it from parcel (UPS).When I came I saw that I was carrying the violated Amazon stamps I was not going to receive it, but the parcel company told me that in the customs office they opened it, so it was marked with red letters and they put a tape with green letters from the customs that told UPS MEXICO to replace that of Amazon that they had broken (also in the notifications of delivery of the package appeared that I had entered revision at the customs office), so, I received it and indeed only opened the box that Amazon put, the box where came the phone was intact with its warranty stamps.So, it has remained quiet and checked that the phone was intact, new and sealed.The phone to me seems to be something big, I didn't get used, but it was worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","At first I had my doubts about wanting to buy an imported product because of the possibility (I have seen several cases like this) of theft or lost cell phone, although Amazon always supports all purchases.Trust in chance, I went from uncertainty to action and I do not regret it. It came in less than a month, even when it said it would take longer. Indeed, it is the version of 256 GB of storage and Snapdragon processor. The version sold from the USA. does not come with the power bank as the title says, but you will not need it, really not. Passing then to the cell phone, I do not have much to say. I come from a S10 plus and nothing strange, not even the micro SD card or the jack of headphones. The design, presence and speed of this mobile will make you overlook those details.You have to have eagle eye to notice the resolution of screen lower than your ancestors (I tried it at the side of the S10 plus).The ultra-fast charge is noticed and, for how little that I have used it until now, it seems to give battle with its more than 4 thousand milliampers of cellular.The camera will give away."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The package arrived well sealed and the cell phone came super safe on your bubble paper, it is appreciated that that security is considered when making the shipments.Of the others no talk, it is a high-end phone, nothing is discussed, an excellent team, also emphasize that the box came sealed, no violated seal or anything like that.Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The article arrived fast but the box does not contain the original Samsung stamps just like the phone was with fingerprints and without the label of the serial number and imei, that makes me doubt very much if it is a new or used phone and even if it is reconditioned, for me it is something very annoying since I just had in mishap with a s20 plus that returned because I entered it water as it was reconditioned and bought this to replace the other and I am afraid that the same thing will happen with this device I need to contact Amazon and the seller to clarify if it is new and if I will not return it I will not risk again that I will miss a phone in less than a month"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had my doubts to buy this cell phone for Amazon, I doubted that it was really the American version, since I was looking for this version with Snapdragon processor and besides that it had a very good price to be true. But the truth everything went excellent, the cell phone arrived as specifications and I could validate it without problems. Excellent cell phone, what I like most is the 120hz refresh rate."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything in perfect condition, 100% functionality, I loved the 21+, the only detail is that they do not deliver the Power Bank 10,000 mah, only the S21+ cell phone arrives, they delivered it earlier than scheduled"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sucking on the phone, I had my doubts if it would be worth it as it came from a Galaxy S9, which is brutality and still rifando, but if you have the opportunity to buy it, go ahead, you will be delighted, detail as to sound as I hear it sounded powerful, yet it sounds just like the S9, from there on out, a phone brutalityP.D. Written from my Galaxy S21 Plus"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very good arrived in 1 week, I already completed another week of use and has perfectly surrendered the battery holding even more than a day. The screen is big but surely you can hold it and write it with one hand. It comes sealed and works perfect with the Telcel network here in Mexico. (Eye brings cable but no power adapter)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I arrived in perfect condition, original 100%, the power bank did not come but Amazon knew how to fix that inconvenience.This equipment was Snapdragon, unlocked.I have been in use for about 15 days and so far everything perfect with the cell phone and at an excellent price comparing it with the equipment offered in Mexico.More later I will be updating this post."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've been on my cell phone for a month now and it's pretty fast, in fact it brings the snapdragon. The camera is amazing though if I have to say that the zoom of 30x fails, but the cell phone is cool."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very good phone, delivers everything you would expect from a Samsung badge, detected me the VoLTE and the 4.5G network just when placing the Telcel SIM card, the 120Hz screen is excellent, although I notice that energy consumption increases by enabling that option."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I liked the big camera, the screen size and the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent team worked well, arrived in good condition, faster than the estimated delivery date said, I am in Mexico and was compatible with telcel"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent cell phone, your snapdragon processor is quite put on, the cell phone battery practically lasts all day"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","For the price I was at, I had doubts as to whether I was reliable but now that I have the product I don't regret it at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It works perfect in Mexico, a great price and I put Chip Telcel and it works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent product, arrived early, sealed, the only thing that is needed to the cell phone is that it can fly :v"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It came in excellent condition. It works totally well. With the Crystal sheath of spigen it looks super good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's great!! I love everything you do and the ease of nanejo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought the cell phone on February 2021 and for July it didn't turn on the screen, I repaired it on Samsung and now in October again it doesn't turn on the screen, if you're from MX they won't make you valid the warranty on Samsung MX and the cost of repair is 7 thousand pesos and the opinion of the damage is that some updates aren't compatible with the screen... if you're from MX or another country other than USA don't buy it, save yourself money and hassle."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent service and excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Quality product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The cell phone only worked 3 months apart from this time I present failure turned off the screen and so far I realize that it is not the first time that happens since there are more comments about it.Wrong by Amazon they should have a better filter with their sellers as it has more than 2 weeks that the device was returned and I have no answer from anyone nor refund any."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Amazing product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I asked for support from SAMSUNG and via remote they connected to the phone and told me that it is not double sim..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The 10/10 device, but I didn't get the powerbank, and Amazon didn't fix anything. They turned a blind eye."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","I was satisfied with my phone but no longer receives calls, I think having paid so much failure very soon that does not allow me to retrust"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","It is ral and as I expected it charm me do not hesitate to buy it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excellent, the equipment arrived before the expected time, according to the specifications, with its packaging with original stamps. I would buy back my equipment with this seller and recommend it widely."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","The cell phone came to me earlier than planned in perfect condition, in closed box with Samsung stamps, for my needs this perfect, excellent service, I highly recommend to Karlitashop, as I also send my invoice in time and form."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Very bad zoom, very ugly photos!!!, a disappointment, for the price!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The reliability is used and with improvements that are advertised on camera and screen. Increased refresh rate is felt. The battery would be the weak point, because although it is not bad, it does feel short for a phone at the top of the range."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Without a doubt it is an excellent equipment, perhaps the autonomy of its battery is not the best, but its camera, processor and especially the screen has nothing to envy to other terminals."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Very nice, premium materials, excellent night photography, suitable size, is fast, the battery doesn't last so long for the price..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Fast shipping, product as described! I am international buyer, I am very pleased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone has a very nice model 10, the weight, the quality dw the materials. But they are not enough to compare price and quality. The screen compared to cellular oytos is seen with a little less brightness in the light, I bought it since I thought it was the best option for photographs and videos and I still believe that yes, but there are equally important aspects when choosing and staying with a cell phone, especially if it costs you on average $1200 usd. All the comparison made with my old huawei 30. Its extremely deficient battery, lasted at a very 5 hours with screen on and that changed the configuration to save energy. The phone is heated with just keeping a video call, that also makes the battery consume faster, I get with a defect dd makes a small stain on the screen that was not something alarming to continue using it why while it was on was almost imperceptible, the audio is not the best and worst, one day I take an airplane and for some reason when I get off the same bocina had broken, I definitely opt good ppwee back to my old."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","All right."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Excellent product worth every penny invested"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Horrible battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I expected better performance but it's okay"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","A good buy and a 10 out of 10"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The battery lasts long enough if you don't use it, but the regular use I give the cell phone consumes the battery a lot, but from everything else I loved the cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It was the best. Excellent service."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","All good in time and form"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love it, it feels great. Everything works great. Super recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's no use. It doesn't last the battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I recommend this cell phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Very agile delivery and the price was very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The best in cameras and performance in the market."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","As a mobile device I cannot wish for more, its latest generation specifications, its good battery durability (this one has to give it a week or so to suit your way of using it as it is smart), its excellent building materials and even its cameras left me nothing to want."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excellent phone super recommended!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's very good phone to take pictures, videos and above all watch movies and be able to draw with the spin, but for what I really buy it it is to play games like Mobile Legends and Lol its performance I didn't like"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I am very satisfied with the equipment, comes sealed the box and everything new as announced by the publication 1000% I recommend them, I arrive ahead of time and all well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I arrive sealed and new. Everything in order and to this day is a plane. There were no issues in the purchase or delivery already with code, that if I opened it in front of the delivery man and like that he does not like but understands that they have had bad handlings some. I could also bill without issues the purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excellent cell phone, the best Android of 2022. Worth it and is reliable this seller, the team came to me new"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","So far all well, met my expectations and the delivery was very fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The most important thing! I arrive in perfect condition, new and sealed factory, very good phone, the only detail would be the performance of the battery, in my case I arrived with Qualcom processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","All in order."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It came sealed, the right color, the spectacular screen. The device is unlocked and accepts the 5G network without problem. The version is correct with that of USA, my only surprise (not bad) is that this cell phone is dual SIM."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excellent purchase, take it in promotion, for 25 is a good purchase, heats up a little every certain time, the battery does not last long, use continuous maybe 4 hrs with full battery, still it is good purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Touch quality, great battery performance, excellent cameras. A very good purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The package arrived well, asked for password, the phone is in excellent condition, sealed, new. The S22 does not bring charger, only the cable type C. So far the phone works perfect, and arrived in the time estimated by the App."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Purchase 100% recommended, arrive sealed equipment and in perfect condition. A good purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Be careful to be scammed, if you are going to make this purchase before giving the code to receive the package, take evidence from the delivery man and unit. Since in my case it was up to me to receive the package without the equipment inside, it came only box of the cell phone with USB cable and manuals. If possible, open the package so that you have all the necessary evidence in case I passed the same thing. I am now in water and waiting for my purchase refund to be made."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Cell phone doesn't seem to be new, it comes scratched from the sides, and doesn't bring Samsung's original stamps."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","They sent me the wrong color; even the box is marked as Phantom Black. I don't know if the phone is reconditioned; the stamps that came in the box I think are not Samsung's originals. The phone appears for sale as ""new"". Otherwise the phone has worked well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","1. The color that the publication says is black and I got a gray color 2. The cell phone is from Canada not from US. I returned it because it was not what I asked for based on the publication."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","They say q is dual sim and it's not true"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfect device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quick"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent cell phone"
