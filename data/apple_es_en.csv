"The cell phone works regularly well, the proximity sensor wasn’t working well but it wasn’t a major problem....

"$570 for this!, I'm really surprised, it's a good phone and it seems to me its strongest point 94% of battery life, I arrived the same day I asked for it thanks to Prime, his box brought a generic charger and a glass screen protector, something normal on second hand phones is scratches, this came with two pretty big scratches on the screen, (They don't interfere with the view of the screen and they don't get perceived at a considerable distance), when I put the screen protector completely disappeared so it's a good point, a case and everything is perfect, I hope it goes on like this these months, all looks good, the sim card took it smoothly and it took just a few minutes to bring my old Iphone information to this one. It's a good cell phone, very lucky, I hope you buy one and the seller sends you a good one!"

"I arrived in excellent condition and with a battery at 97%."
"The phone took a week to arrive, a day before the planned one, the truth came of very very good quality, until right now that I have been using it works perfectly, I use it with Telcel network and perfectly grabbed the signal, in the same aesthetic way it looks almost in perfect condition, only a small blow in a corner but the only thing, on the screen everything perfect, without any detail and it was my biggest fear because I saw many comments where it was scratched and this came all perfect, speakers, Face ID, calls, cameras, everything in perfect condition, as if it were all new. The only detail is that it came with 84% battery, I think that a little more and everything would have been perfect for me, arrived in a custom charge and the charger and cable are not original, so that they take into account that. For the price it seems an excellent purchase and I strongly recommend to buy it."
"Very good Product, I arrived in good condition and it took a month and did not cause me failures!!"
"I find it an excellent purchase for the cost and model of the phone, even though it already has its years works very well and still has other years of update.The only detail that I found it, is that they changed the screen, it is not the original of Apple, still it is a good screen, it is also oled, but if you compare it with another iphone with original screen if you see the difference, but it is something that really in the day nor notice, works very well.Esthetically it arrived well without details and with stack to 89%"
"♪ Stand new ♪"
"I arrive in good condition the battery does not arrive perfect, the appearance is good, only the sound for the horn if it is damaged, but all well"
"I arrived well packaged with a generic charger and the cell phone, it's the only thing, at first sight I only had a scratch on the screen but with a glass mica it was fixed, you don't see anything, battery I reach 87%, I use it almost all day and at the end of my working day with a daily use; I arrive with 50-40% batteryI have 512 GB, maybe I was lucky but it was a good purchase"
"Aesthetic almost again, it only has a very light scratches on the screen that with a glass mica are no longer perceived. Mark and back as new. Supposedly they come with more than 90% in battery condition and reached me with 88%, even in a checklist they send you, so says. I give it a rating of 9."
"I bought this article a year and a half ago masomenos is still in good condition, excellent the camera, the only thing that I have had problems is that you don't listen when they call me and it doesn't vibrate when they call me but everything else is excellent.When I got there I came with two brands of pacifiers to the front implying that they had already opened it, so new because it isn't.I checked it and if I said that it had already been opened."
"This equipment acquired it with the Buyspri seller, all this perfect has aesthetic of 10/10, battery condition 84%, in my case a serious detail that the team was made a change of screen but it was realized by apple & brings all its functions to 100%"
"The best purchase I have made in Amazon, the team goes through perfectly a new one, is in excellent aesthetic conditions, battery life at 91% and arrived earlier than expected. I would definitely buy again, I am very satisfied"
"I have learned not to doubt the quality of the refurbished products. I have not failed at all this cell phone and arrived with good percentage of battery. When you can, take advantage."
"Bring all your accessories, excellent condition, very well packed"
"I got it in good condition and if it's original"
"I was in excellent condition."
"All right, aesthetic of 9.5/10, I give you this rating for the fact that I expected better volume on the speaker, also I expected better condition on the battery, I arrived with an 84% that is not so bad but if very soon I will have to change the battery to the device, that there if I already added another expense to it, otherwise everything went well, I liked that it arrived soon until before the expected, that it arrived with guarantee also and all well packed, only for the detail of the battery and the speaker I give it 4 stars, I would give it 4.5 but Amazon does not allow me to put .5, also I expected an original cable but the generic one is well and also I expected it to arrive with a bucket of 20w but I arrived with a good cube and I like the purchase, I recommend to the seller at 100"
"In aesthetics it seems new, it has no scratch or punch or anything, the screen brings a protective mica that I did not want to remove. Functionality to 100 without any detail. It is that practically looks new in truth, the only detail that could have is that the stack has a condition of 85% but so far it has not resulted in a problem, it has endured perfectly all day. Excellent buy so far."
"Like new, everything's fantastic."
"Functionally well, although I found details in the physical conditions of the iphone like a few scratches around the cameras, and on the buttons. At first glance it does show that it had a good time of use, but there is no major failure or blow that are very noticeable"
"I arrive in very good condition the cell phone  if I recommend it and apart the very good customer support !!!"
"Almost a year with him and my traveling partner hasn't let me down."
"I've been with my cell phone for 6 months, the stack is great, I don't have to charge it every time, excellent quality, screen intact, if I recommend a lot if you want to buy something at a good cost, I'll buy it again soon"
"I like it size, and especially I've always used Apple, it hasn't yet premiered...I'm sure it will give me excellent service!"
"Practically new equipment, with 100% aesthetic, 90% battery, so far working perfectly, I have 3 weeks with the ."
"the device is in perfect condition, I see that it brings technical support application if this warranty is valid ?"
"The phone arrived with 85% battery. The truth is that using it well lasts your battery one day.As for the condition of the computer, the phone arrived without a single rayon, nor seems to be used, the condition is excellent.Obviously, it arrives in a box different from the original one, well sealed that yes, it also brings a super generic charger and cable, but they work.For the price, it is fine.It is an excellent product, highly recommended."
"After 2 months of use has not given me any problem, I get 100% battery"
"I've been with the 1 month and everything Perfect came with the 90 of battery and without any punch previously I had bought another iPhone but with Amazon distributor and I had to return it the month because it was heated and lost the signal with this so far all right!"
"I like it very much, I recommend it but a lot of eye with the condition of the battery"
"good in relation to quality/price, if you would buy it again.The only detail is the battery is not at 100%"
"I'm impressed with the aesthetics of the cellular equipment, without any scratches, the equipment is totally new I would buy another cell phone again without problem, 100% recommended."
"Well, that's just all right."
"It came with 100% battery, it's worked very well, without problems, and physically perfect."
"If it came badly mistreated more of the others that I have bought as reconditioned but its functioning is good but it does not feel like other direct envoys from Amazon.From the packing and box in a simple box that it is even scary to think that they sent it in packaging and went around jumping.And this one touched that it was like stained from the screen but only from the glass and it is only seen if you see it backlighted and a little scratched from the chrome of the bow but with the case no longer seen."
"It came with 85% battery, it has a small rayon perceptible in the lower horn part. Except for that the aesthetic is almost perfect, I am happy with my purchase."
"After almost a year of use, the iPhone works perfectly well. The truth was that I was looking forward to buying a reconditioned cell phone but so far absolutely everything serves EXCEPT by the speakers; they are not burst but they are not working 100% (if I use the speaker in a call it can sometimes be difficult to hear). Either way I use hearing aids and the top speaker for calls does not represent any problem. When it came to me, it came in generic box and without charger. It did not come to me with dents or scratched screen or any visible detail. It looked practically new. The truth if I recommend it because the prices of the Iphone Pro Max in Mexico at those dates were for 20-30 thousand pesos in different shops and saved me a lot of pejedolars."
"I made my purchases with different sellers but the same Amazon product marks me in the same place.In the first purchase the cell phone came perfect, 100% battery without any aesthetic detail, original and practically new, the only thing was that it was not released, they could not help me and I had to return it, that seller had no more devices, I had to look for another one.The second purchase, the cell phone worked ""well"", it came to me with 85% battery and very stained glass from the back, so that did not please me and I decided to give it the opportunity a few days, but checking with other acquaintances iphone,!the camera came of very poor quality!, it looked very blurred compared to the other cell phones, that was what made me decide to return it."
"The product arrived me with a day of delay, arrived in a generic box. The charger also generic.The aesthetic I put a 10, the screen came with tempered glass mica.I have not noticed any scratch on the screen or anything.I have been with it for a little more than a week, and so far it works well.As for the degradation of the battery I arrived with 93%.The product I bought it in $11,999 to 1 year, months without interest.The negative:When I update to IOS15.5 the battery is degraded to 88% (see image) I ask:Is this normal?Do I already communicate with BuySpRY and they answered me, send them the screenshot of the health of the battery, as well as the IMEIConclusion: In general I am happy with the purchase, the only defect, is that the health of the battery is deteriorated, by updating the operating system."
"Aesthetically it looks like new except for one detail, likewise its operation is correct except for the speaker that has distortion and when raising the volume you notice even more than thunder. I think about whether to send it clean or return it for the refund, anyone knows if I send it clean is no longer valid the guarantee?"
"It came to me with 85% of the battery and the horn doesn't sound good."
"The product is reconstructed as they say, the bad thing is that they do not use original parts so the phone has the feature of detecting the component that is not original. Despite all this the phone works properly, so far I have not found any problem for its correct functioning. as far as aesthetics is practically new it does not have any rayon. Percentage of the battery is 100%."
"The process of acquiring my device was very particular as I found the publication and 20 minutes later I decided to buy it, obviously because it was an online purchase of a cell phone “caro”, “discontinuous” and re-conditioning did not feel completely safe, since I thought it was going to be a type of scam or it was not going to arrive in the conditions that I expected, fortunately everything I thought was false since I have been using it for about 2 weeks and night and it has not presented me any fault so far, it should be noted that I received it without any damage and with the condition of my battery to 94%, I supported much of the comments of the publication and I was aware that it was trusting and having a little luck that it did not arrive damaged, I repeat, until now everything has gone well and I will continue to use it day, fortunately the cell counts with warranty with Amazon and it is original, just as I distrust a little for the price since in other places it was worth more and for less capacity in memory, but one advice that I can give them is to try it, buy it, try it, check it out, check it out as it does it does it does it does it out with the warranty with them, I do them out, I do not apply the warranty and I do it and I do a little bit because I did it at all the price as well because in other."
"It is very good device if you find it on offer it arrived with 94% battery works with Telcel in Mexico and with Redi Coppel without problems with Altan networks"
"I have been with the phone for 10 days, arrived in very good condition, in a generic box with generic charger and cable as mentioned in the description, did not bring any scratch on the edges or on the back, I removed the protective mica from the screen and only brings two small scratches as if they had put it in the bag and scratched it with coins or keys, but it does not affect the operation, I re-placed the mica and everything looks new, I no longer had an apple care guarantee, it brings a living condition of 91% and it indicates to me that it continues to calibrate the battery, at the end of the calibration it dropped to 89%, I would have liked it to come with more life condition as I read in most comments they had above 95%, but well, the face id works very well, the volume, microphone and horn work very well, the camera is a beauty, and I think it was a good purchase, it is advisable to buy the original cable and charger to keep the battery in good condition, according to Apple to have up to 80% of battery is optimal, although I repeat, I would have liked that it brought better condition than 89%..."
"After 3 months of use, the cell phone works smoothly. It is worth acquiring these products. I get 86% battery and some scratches on the screen. With the screen protector you do not notice any scratches"
"At first I had doubts for some negative comments that I found, I decided to take a risk and did the purchase. The package arrived 2 days earlier than estimated so it was quite fast. As for the aesthetics it is quite good, light scratches on the side chromes and a small rayon on screen, which is concealed quite well with a screen protector, as for the rear, the aesthetic is impeccable, in terms of battery arrived with 86%.I have been using it for a short time and so far has not presented any problem.The only negative detail that I found, was the charger and cable that they bring, they feel of very little quality and the charge is quite slow.I recommend buying an original one to avoid later problems with the charge or battery of the equipment."
"I get it because I'm bored of dealing with STORAGE WITH OTHER IPHONES, I'M DEEDING TO CONTENT CREATION, SO STORAGE IS INDISpensABLE TO ME, FOR MY IT WAS A INVESTMENT MORE THAN A LUXURY, AND I'M SATISHED, WITHOUT EMBARGO, THERE'S A LOT TO BE TAKE CARE OF BECAUSE IT'S A LESS AND A DONE FALL."
"It arrived in perfect conditions, practically new. I recommend to buy"
"After a lousy experience with achemex with a first purchase where I got a stack instead of the iphone, I chose buyspry for his good comments, I got a battery equipment to 83%, all original except the display, the application 3utool indicated to me that it was changed and if you notice because it has some glue on its sides, the display is somewhat scratched by the use and everything else is impeccable, due to the urgency that I have decided to keep it, but it will be on the lookout for the operation,"
"Come on, the phone itself is of very good quality and for the price, it is worth buying it.Just a few days ago I received it and I am testing its performance, performance and functions to decide if it is a computer that is worth staying or making effective the 90-day warranty that is offered when purchasing it.So far the details that I have found, despite knowing that it is a used equipment, has enough scratches on the front screen that do not affect the operation and usually go unnoticed with a protective mica, some details on the bezels of the cameras and two or three strokes and scrapes on the edges of the phone, does not seem anything serious but the aesthetic lets you want and ""note"" that it is a used equipment.Another detail, the battery reached 87%, understandable when used, but it would be a plus that had at least 90%.In general with the purchase, well, nothing extraordinary but with a view to making use of the warranty."
"Excellent, first of all the device came without any physical damage, I checked it in detail and did not find a single rayon, came without software problems and the condition reached me at 85%, I thought it would be a problem that battery but the battery lasts me all day, I have been using it for two months and I have not had any problems, the reviews that I read before encouraging me to buy the iphone discouraged me a bit, but I decided to risk and I am very happy and satisfied with the purchase, 100% recommended!!"
"I arrived in perfect condition of everything except that the audio horn where you answer the calls was a little dirty but it led to the general cleaning of the whole device and I was in perfect condition, I arrived with a 94% battery is the 3 apparatus that I bought renovated and I have not had any problem with any of them"
"Good team, at first hesitate a lot to buy used as I have read some bad reviews and other good ones, in my case the team that arrived to me has not presented problems (3 months of use).I arrived quite well packing, without scratches, without blows, the phone was quite good.Of course it pays a little more for Amazon but you are paying SAFETY and QUALITY, each phone comes with a hand-filled inspection card on someone who inspected and cleaned the phone.I arrive with 90% of the battery capacity that promises the publication and I have not had topics that the Pila does not last or that the phone heats up.If you are doubting whether to trust or not Amazon Renewed uses this review as evidence that fulfills what it promises and you have the advantage of returning it if it does not meet your expectations or the description."
"I really liked the phone I arrived impeccable with a 92% battery, with the color that I asked for even came with a protective glass.What I did not like is that it comes with a generic charger that is not the original and it gets very warm when I put it to charge and in only 2 days low from 92% to 90% the condition of the battery. I consider that for the price of $13,500 pesos it must have included an original charger so that this part does not be affected since it is a reconditioning product this if it affects the phone and it is cost to change a new battery. (PD send me an original charger )"
"Well then the product arrived me in good condition but in the part of the horn , it looks a little grated but with a cover it is not noticeable , of the prosesador this very well I arrive with the 87% pile and I have already used it and well. the good that has 90 days of guarantee"
"We know that a refurbished phone can bring some details, but we still hope that they are smaller and that it is worth what we are paying. I don’t know if in the photos you will get to appreciate but the phone came with a major hit on a corner and several deep rallions on the screen, so I decided that I’ll return it."
"The cost-benefit of the product is good as long as it works"
"The phone is good it fulfills all the functions and the battery to 90% as mentioned in the description only that I have two months with the and the charger no longer works any of the doscable nor the quadrito of the current, in the product if it specifies that the product as it is refurbished does not contain original accessories but that Amazon checks that the accessories are of quality, unfortunately the charger of the phone that I bought did not work and the worst is that the purchase does not give me option to report it. I feel that for this type of products Amazon should better verify the quality of the accessories that they send"
"Excellent equipment, the only one but is the life of the Battery, came in 84% of there no details."
"The excellent cell phone in my case the battery reached 100%, very small details at the top but almost imperceptible I highly recommend"
"The product arrived without any problem. When I opened it I realized that it is practically new. The charger is not original (they warn you from the purchase) but the problem is that it is not compatible the voltage and does not manage to load it correctly, it could even damage it since it was heated.If you have a new charger from some previous iPhone it is better to use it.Out of that, it is a great purchase and I am satisfied."
"I had my doubts at the time of buying it the team is in a 99 of aesthetics the only bad thing was that the battery reached 84%"
"Charger cable not working"
"At the beginning it was a bit gullible, many other users comment that they have reached equipment with 90% to 99% of battery in my case it was not so, if not that ah arrived with 100% but, the whole screen is with micro stripes, like the lenses of the camera, that is to say by far if you can appreciate that it is very scratched more when the light gives it directly, I hope to be able to solve it applying a mica, but of the rest I am very happy so far the photographs have not had problem thinking that also the lenses are too scratched, I do not blame to its previous owner the fact of not putting some protector in the end is the taste of each person and for that reason it lowers the price of the team.At the end, this is like a roulette that luck will touch us a good team like a bad one."
"The team arrived a day before the estimated date. It was a complete surprise. I couldn’t wait. It came with 90% capacity, somewhat less than I had expected. It included a generic charger, but it works well and a pincito to pull out the chip, nothing else. Mica included, but it has two circular marks that I have no idea where they came from, although they only look against the light. The equipment works well, a cover is extremely necessary because it is very slippery without one, sometimes like it takes long to grab the cellular connection, but it’s just a matter of waiting. Lenses in good condition, functional camera, flash works well, horn works well, buttons work well. The rest are complaints that I have about the system and the screen size, but nothing to do with the Amazon service. In short, I bought it because there was a bank promotion, and I was looking for it several days because sometimes it cost almost 1000 pesos less, I don’t know what factors there are to make these price changes happen, the only thing I know is that 18K is too hard. The battery does it, although it’s not extraordinary, I wouldn’t expect it’t have less of the “i Camera very good”."
"The phone in perfect condition, there is an inconvenience I have inconsistencies in the network and unfortunately it is only compatible with the AT&T network if it was compatible with all companies in Mexico would be perfect"
"Very good."
"I give you 4 stars because the screen came very scratched, only from day to day interferes with visibility, otherwise the cell phone works very well and fulfills, of necessity do not return it, but if you can not accept one with scratches, it is better to change it"
"I arrived very quickly the team was impeccable only the earphone or horn was heard very badly I had to return it, as well as arriving my return I will ask again I hope that now if everything comes well"
"In good general condition, stack 90% a slight scrape on the screen, out of that well"
"The phone arrived well, the screen a little grated the truth is that it is not bad yet that if I expected a phone with a higher battery condition since the price of 12,000 because if it is something high, I reach with 87% of everything else well"
"Good aesthetics."
"The only “bad” would be the generic charger with which it comes as it charges too slow. But well, it is reconditioned, neither Apple gives it to you with a pulley charger. Outside of that, aesthetically and functionally arrived in perfect condition and with a battery condition at 91%. Everything excellent and without any inconvenience, even came 3 days after making my purchase"
"The iPhone came to me without any apparent cosmetic problem and with 93% battery, generic charger of good quality. Satisfied with my purchase!"
"If I had a little more battery life than best"
"Except for a tiny rayon on the right hand side the phone is spectacular! I had an iphone 6 s and I could no longer endure jaja, the upgrade was great, it came with generic charger but charged in 2 hours and I can easily give it 12 hours of continuous use. The stack arriving was 90%, I waited months to write this review and the pile is still 90%! That yes, I do not use it when it is charging for nothing. I already came with protector for the front and back, so I could start using it without fear that it would scratch (only has a thin mica, but does the job), in general very good product!"
"It's a good purchase, it came to me with 94% battery in excellent condition, no scratches, no defects. I've been with it for 4 months and it works properly."
"I liked it very much, I had never had an Iphone, I had my distrust if to buy it, but already after a month seeing it arrived in perfect conditions, of course it brings generic charger was not going to arrive with the original, although you can buy the original separately afterwards, the screen is very good and the phone has no aesthetic detail, only be careful is very light and slippery I recommend buying some cover and mica for greater protection."
"I asked the IVECSA STORE's tendency with some fear of reading that I am sending products that were not what they were asking for and in all the problems was Amazon's parcel delivery I took a chance and I asked my surprise was that my cell phone has never been opened this as a bone factory is NOT RECONDITIONED, the only detail that has is minimal scratches on the screen that with the mica you do not see, I am very happy with my purchase."
"It comes very well packing, it came with tempered glass when I took it off it had some scratches on the screen of the top right does not affect anything, everything else is very well maintained the cell phone, it would battery 88%, I have been using it almost 14 days and it goes very well, so far no faults and if you look for an iPhone this is the indicator quality price"
"I will detail the following: the phone was received in good packing condition, when you open the box you find a generic sealed box, inside the iPhone, charger and cable, aesthetically the phone was in excellent almost immaculate condition I would say, with some small scratches in the frame of the phone however it took me the surprise to remove the tempered glass that is already installed when the iPhone arrives, with very notorious and deep scratches throughout the screen, that come to subtract a lot from the overall aesthetics of the computer, I had read that these iPhones already carried that tempered glass installed to precisely cover those scratches and that they pass unnoticed, and I can confirm that it is true.Battery arrived at 92%, loudspeakers, microphones and cameras working perfectly, it comes released, however it does not work with Altan networks.However a few days later, I started to notice what in the back of the phone appreciated a small opening what made me doubt if the phone was well sealed and in the uncertainty of thinking that it could get bigger I decided to return the phone."
"The team is very good, I have no problem with it, I have been using it for a week and it seems to be in optimal condition. It brings aesthetic details like scratches on the screen and in one of the cameras. Battery comes to 88% and I think from there on out is fine"
"Battery to 80%When reading other reviews I had very high expectationsI thought that really aesthetically it would look divineBut on the front of the screen above the face it is like scraping or as if it was flawless to put back the screenLigeros stems that are not seen in the golden order of the frame by the chargerSo far I work very well I have little with the upgrade afterI feel that it cost me a little more than if I bought one of use of the same model on the other handIt's my first iPhone since iPhone 4 had always used Samsung, I thought that I would do itBut the truth is that it is very good when functions the dual sim never works the chip so I use it as uni sim"
"The charger they sent him with stopped working two weeks later, but in itself, the phone works very well and had no aesthetic details."
"Excellent conditions"
"Excellent quality and price"
"The screen came scratched and punched"
"I've been working with him for 3 days at 100% that I arrived with a few scratches on the screen, they don't affect and with the battery at 87%"
"I was very satisfied with the product, practically it seems that it is new, it only has a very light scrape on top but caused by the case from there out the impeccable screen and very good performance. I had my doubts to buy for some reviews, but in the end it was a good decision"
"The iPhone that came to me comes in excellent condition I have tried it several days and I have no complaint the battery was 100% and very well cared for!"
"The product is Original, at first I thought the antenna was damaged, then I realized that I was turning the SIM upside down, the conditions of the equipment are very good, the battery has 100% charge retention, although the screen comes too scratched and some very deep and very noticeable"
"I had doubt to buy it but in the end I arrived with aesthetics of 10 and with battery of 84"
"the truth the team arrived in excellent condition, without any details and working perfectly. do not fear to buy reconditioned products, the truth are very good and at an excellent price."
"It has many features and can be taken advantage of to the maximum."
"I bought my iPhone 11 pro max of 256 gb with a little fear. Obviously the product is a “semi-new” computer or as the seller says “renewed”. However, my surprise was that I got a phone in very good condition. The battery at 93% and with a my good aesthetic. The screen came with a pre-installed tempered glass, that when I changed it for another, I could notice that the screen has some small scratches, but nothing to prevent me from enjoying the phone. What if I have to say, the charger (cubo) is a mockery, of very poor quality, the only thing to recover was the lighting cable. I didn’t have much trouble, because I charged it with the charger of my iPad (20w) which makes the fast charge work. I’m about to fulfill a month with the equipment, if I had an additional comment, I update my review."
"I really like the color the service the important is functional and you save many weights the aesthetic came out 9/10 which is great for the price"
"The product came as new with 95% battery, only some scrapes in the area around the cameras but nothing that affected its operation, the cell phone worked with my cell company and in general I have none but, as if I had bought it new"
"The truth was a little scary reading some of the less favorable comments. But I was encouraged as I saw that returns could be made and that there was good communication with the seller. The product came to me in a box x, and with a current adapter x as well as they say in the publication. The iPhone arrived nine and when I turned it on I reached almost 100% battery and with the new update it did not take me any surprise for bad.It also lasted several days waiting since they drive months without interest but I think one should be attentive for when they put them because they only last a few days and then without months and then they come back."
"Very good product came to me as new and has very good functioning"
"The product in general comes very well, not damaged or mistreated, not scratches the capacity of the battery is 92% the only bad thing is that the screen is not the original apple; it is noticed in the quality of the colors"
"It's a good phone, no damage, the horn sounds great, but on receiving it it didn't bring charger and mentions that if it was included, I need to investigate how to report it to the provider."
"The iPhone arrived in an excellent condition , aesthetic 9/10, lightweight brands of use in the frames that are only appreciated if you look very closely.The screen very well, included a mica, when removing it you see light brands of use on the screen that are only noticeable without the mica and only if you look very closely and with a strong light.The back and camera are impeccable, not a single rayon nor a single brand of use.The battery reaches 96%How to expect to arrive in a generic box with cable and generic chargers but it is no problem because you can easily buy Apple officers.Generally very satisfied, it is a good option to get a device of this type and saves a little money"
"Battery 84%Aesthetic only had a scratch on the frameAll right"
"The truth is that I am very happy with my purchase. I arrive the other day of my payment, I came in a simple but well protected box, I brought a glass mica and a plastic projector, I brought the little iron to open the chip holder, the charger if you see half a chafa jaja but because there I said that generic and it fulfills its function, it came with the battery to 97%, if it comes released, I put the Telcel chip in Mexico and it is all in order, I have been using it for 3 days and I am super happy, I give it to me for birthday. The truth I wanted to buy it on the other side but because if it was a lot of money and because I feared that they would steal it, then I decided for Amazon as it promises 90 days guarantee and they return all the money, so I confided, I hope I did not miss the cell phone, but the truth comes almost as new, it only has 2 mini scratches almost imperceptible on a side of the screen, so I don't think that nothing happens to it."
"It is an excellent option for those who want an iPhone with service guarantee at a lower price"
"It came to me with 87 drums but the truth is that it doesn't show, the battery lasts all day.It came with generic charger but it hasn't warmed up or anything strange."
"The cell phone came to me with impeccable quality, practically as new no physical damage or scraping on screen.Battery at 90I used it almost the month and without problemsI am very satisfied with the purchaseLoader and cable of good quality."
"The caller's loudspeaker's too low."
"The cell phone came whole, does not seem reconstructed, without dents, without scratches or anything aesthetic, functionality to 100, sound to 100 very good model."
"The phone is excellent its operation is Perfect, cameras in perfect condition, screen without any scratches just like the impeccable back part, the quality is 10/10, but I put 4 stars since it is written very clearly that the phone comes with 90% minimum battery performance, and mine arrived with 86% which I do not like very much, from there on more everything Perfect"
"Okay, but it came in a little scratchy."
"The shipment was very fast, more than in other purchases that have been made, the product actually exceeded my expectations by a lot, very good purchase really, I didn't have or at least I didn't notice any aesthetic details, the life of the battery reached 85% but it yields me better than another that I had alive of 90%"
"The phone came to me with 86% battery life, aesthetically it is perfect except a corner of the screen that has scratched like when you bring the phone and also the keys and it goes scratching with the movement, that I do not like because I have had iPhone for years and I have never been scratched like this, it does not affect its operation and everything internally works well"
"I had my doubts before buying it, but I am more than satisfied with the state of the phone. It is practically a new team. And what I encourage in the end was the support of Amazon. It will not be the last one I buy in Renewed."
"The equipment is super good, 100% battery and aesthetic with 99%"
"This product came very well to the exception of one detail. At the time of using the camera of the phone this starts to make noise and the camera vibrates. This does not allow taking pictures or videos properly."
"The phone arrived in time and shape, although it does not arrive in its original box or with original charger or cable, aesthetically arrived 9/10, if you expect a “new” phone because this is not your option haha, I can emphasize that it came with a small rayon on the screen, but from there on out the phone is like new, battery to 90% and so far I am happy with the purchase, it is worth it for the phone that is, the same and you have enough time to return it, it is to risk but because to me it was made good purchase"
"It is my first purchase at Amazon Renewed, BuySpry continue to sell iphones in this state and I will buy again with you. My iphone 11 pro max arrived in excellent physical and operational condition pile to 91% I have been with him one day and at the moment it has not failed, I hope it continues like this. Products with excellent aesthetics and correct functioning do not have to be returned. The seller solves the questions very quickly."
"Send my doubts But the equipment is in very good condition, works everything 100% and the battery at 95%"
"It's all very well."
"I would put 5 stars but the screen had a few slight stripes. The good thing is that already with the mica of hydrogel mate they do not show. I was about to return it but finally I stayed it and it works well. Only that, the stripes on the screen."
"In general it is in good condition, 85% battery when arriving, works well but soon it began to lock, to have small faults that were presented more and more frequently. I did not like it, it was not worth the purchase, only if you like it very much and you do not want to pay for a new one."
"The team arrived in perfect condition, battery at 100% no scratch or punch is as if it were new, I totally recommend to the seller ivecsa store ; previously I had bought one buyspry in silver color but arrived scratched from the frame and with a dent near the camera that left a mark like “bubble” on the glass , that same day I asked for the return."
"I had my doubts about being a refurbished team, arrived just in time and in excellent condition.As new already with mica on the screen, charger and cable.I recommend a lot to buy at BuySpry"
"2 months working perfectly battery to 100% aesthetic 10/10 I found no defect.I have had good experience with Reconditioned Cell phones. I recommend it!"
"I arrived in excellent condition, I had doubts mainly with the stack because there were good comments and some bad ones, but this very nice one brought a aesthetic of 9.9 the stack was at 100, I arrived in box that generic with equal charger, but I use it with another one that already had and it is very well the load lasts much longer than the SE 2020 would definitely buy it again only have to check the seller, many are advertised but not all have good comments some do not even send them."
"Phone of very low quality, basically I will say it is a crappy, for what costs there is better choice! This super reconditioned and has generic pieces (pirates)"
"It brought a few blows in the corners, nothing that affects the operation, with the cover you can see practically nothing, the screen already had a mica on, the activation process was very easy and fast, the computer works quite well, the screen very well, the excellent photos, I have no complaint, the battery arrived with 97% of life."
"The equipment is like new, its aesthetic could be said perfect; 96% battery and so far works very well."
"The phone bought it a couple of days ago because it encouraged me to switch to iPhone and wanted something ""new"" the phone came with a flawless glass mica like the screen and the back of the phone but the sides looked like they had shoved it up the ass to the previous owner was very scratched to the point where I thought they had been sanded and let's be honest obvious that for the price it is worth the phone version but I don't think it's worth paying 17k or 15k so that it's so scratched and it looks like they dragged it down the floor, I know that they will tell me that as long as the device serves it doesn't matter the rest but if at some time you want to sell that it would lower the value to the product because it's already scratched like the battery didn't come so bad it counted 89% of use :)"
"This review I write after a time of use, the team arrived well without apparent scratches with mica, remove the mica and had bolts of use, this personally did not bother me what if I did not like and ended in return was the rapid degradation of the battery, I arrived with 98% and in less than a month it went to 96, then 94 and in two and a half months I had 90% I did the calibration and I stayed in the same percentage besides being notorious to use, I never used it while charging and using an apple charger that I have that it is not fast charge (I have had and I have apple products) so I did not bad usl that the normal without playing heavy games (it never got warmed) I guess the pile went wrong ... I don't think it is like this in all the renovated ones so if I recommend but check them very well."
"Buy this phone for my daily use and be very happy, it was the second time that I bought a device so and I really loved how the device arrives, without scratches, the screen in perfect condition, its battery with a high percentage of life still, very happy the truth. I totally recommend it."
"The battery equipment has a 100% integrity, the housing is in perfect condition without the slightest scratch or hit, but the screen did find many scratches caused by keys or tools, even one of them is deep right in the position of the lens in the front camera. At certain angles the light is minimally reflected by the rayon. It does not affect its operation and with a mica of glass or hydrogel scratches are covered. The charger and cable are generic and the box in turn is generic of good quality."
"I arrived in super good condition, without any detail and the battery above 90%. Super satisfied with my purchase"
"I laughed at it reading several comments that some teams didn’t pull well or after a few days I didn’t have a signal but the truth was that they sent me this almost new one. And it’s 100% alive the pile. I have almost 2 weeks to use it and this is right right now. Only one day I came out if I had a signal but they didn’t come in and there were no calls or data. But I only got into the mitelcel page (I have tel) and I recorded it as saying a little paper that came with the cell. I don’t know if it was for that reason or flat the network shut down for a moment. Typical Telcel siemple that beats it when it rains or it’s cloudy. I don’t know if I can recommend it taking account of the other buyers and not all the “renewed” are identical. Birds like new ones come failing from the factory but the good that ai will always give you another. Here you risk the condition that they make it."
"The phone arrived in generic box and generic functional charger, the battery capacity arrived at 86% , almost nil aesthetic details, the horn is a little misheard, distorted in volume something, if another detail comes out I will consider returning it."
"I haven't been 3 months and it turns on and off, could you support me on how I could make the change or refund?"
"Equipment in perfect condition, I charm.Good view charger, 3 foot cable, good finishes.Battery condition 90%, I will be testing how much durability is within the warranty period.The package arrived earlier than agreed."
"I have a month with the team arrived well a good aesthetic, battery of 86% so far without faults."
"All right, the Face ID failed about 2 months, but it's all in order."
"The media could not be loaded. All right, a few scratches on the sides but no gravity, in general it is in good condition, everything works perfect, with 86% battery, for the price you pay it worth, I am satisfied"
"All right, a few scratches on the sides but no gravity, in general it's in good condition, everything works perfect, with 86% battery, for the price you pay it is worth, I'm satisfied"
"I have used it already for a month, this in excellent condition, I arrive with 91% battery, it is lucky, I asked for another two and they arrived with 86 and 81, I returned them and the third I arrived another 90%, it is a question of risking but everything excellent."
"The ratio PRICE QUALITY is acceptable, the battery is at 90% (it arrived with 91 a month ago), but being an iPhone is already known that this is the thing, I have to mention that it will scare me when I wanted to start backing the cell phone to this new ME FEAR THE PREVIOUS DONE OF THE APPARATO, I thought it was totally deleted, or its not if it is part of the operation, the thing is that today my cell phone is running 100% in all its things without anything weird, (that well all iPhones I have had suddenly have some strange completion for some time) that I attribute to Apple's iOS ... RECOGNIZING IT, by the way all in time and form."
"I have been with him since September , It arrived in good condition, as new aesthetically only the battery arrived in 89% and in 1 month it went down to 86% but I think it is for the charger you have to buy the original, everything else goes well, all the pieces that it has are original"
"Estetica of 10, but when I try it a few days, it takes nothing , it has 82% of bat, already has 12 days that I have returned it and I do not give my refund, pessimo service."
"The equipment works and operates correctly according to manufacturer’s specifications. However, although its condition of refurbishment is clearly specified, the equipment arrived with a glass mica attached to the screen, thus minimizing a very slight scratches. Perhaps it would be worth publishing images of the real products for the cases of refurbishments, instead of catalog images."
"I returned it because it did not meet the standards mentioned in the publication. Poor quality, it does not look new and the battery status was 79%. Make the return and the buyer very good attention made me refund when they revoked my item."
"very good condition, battery 89% without scratches or anything"
"Product as described in the description"
"I got an original iPhone in very good condition the only detail was the screen that was very scratched but with the mica you can no longer see the marks so far all well and the battery reached 88 percent"
"The equipment is as new, but obvious it is not... 9/10 quality cost ratio is definitely the best option for secure and guaranteed purchase. Aesthetic 10/10 and battery 86%. Generic accessories and generic box."
"I bought the equipment and everything was perfect until I realized that it warmed up, sometimes I did when I saw Facebook or instagram, it happened at completely random moments. Sometimes it warmed up too much and it just cooled down until I turned it off, I certainly had to return it for fear that the battery would get worse very quickly because of this."
"I had my doubts about buying a used product, but when talking about something like an iPhone, but the cell phone came to me in three days, practically this new one, has no defect , the battery at 100%. I think it makes an excellent purchase since when comparing the price of a new one with this used there is a lot of difference and in terms of quality and aesthetics in the used one, practically none. I would buy again."
"Actually, rather than selling you a product renewed for some detail, what they sell is a second-hand product. In my case, the equipment even comes with a protective mica and on the edges you notice some dirt, that is, they did not even clean it. On the other hand, the battery life is 85% (average useful life of the equipment that friends or acquaintances currently have and that they acquired when the product went out to market)."
"The only detail I would mention is that the condition of the battery is 85%, I expected at least above 90%, but well the description of the product warns."
"The team arrived well, as the publication says, semi-new equipment, battery life 82%, equipment with Mica on screen, charger and generic usb, and everything working perfectly"
"It came with aesthetics of 10 and 97 on the battery. I barely have 4 days of use and everything perfect."
"I get there on time, all right up to now and the battery comes to 86 for the price that I don't like so much:/"
"I loved everything, it looks new, it has no detail, the battery at 100% just for the charger and the box that are not original, but the equipment certainly a marvel, the best purchase I could have made, thanks to the seller"
"All right, just that they didn't mention that I had a fault in the Face ID, I knew I wasn't buying a new cell phone, but a tool like that essential on the phone has to be mentioned, otherwise I'm satisfied."
"Carved in the corner With light exterior details rating 8 of 10"
"would hit 88% everything else perfect as new, if problems"
"It was my first experience buying renewed and my iPhone arrived impeccable! Obviously it did not arrive in its original box or original accessories but the phone arrived with 100% battery and even with mica for the screen. The only thing that I was slightly dissatisfied with is that the cable that came does not have information that corroborate that it is MFI but out of that, arrives packaged super well. If I buy it again from Buyspry! It should be noted that I bought it by April and for October it remains fully functional."
"This is the 2nd time I asked, the first came with 83% battery and I returned it, this wine as new, and 90% battery, I really recommend excellent option"
"Cell is good aesthetic condition, works very well, comes with generic charger, battery is very good condition"
"I bought this cell phone on June 23, 2021 I make this comment on September 19th almost 3 months of using it, so far everything very well, without any serious detail of use or damage, it only brings two ralloncitos on the screen, nothing that dislikes it. I defined it does not come with charger, nor original box but the truth that nothing happens, the charger works much faster than that of my iPad. So you avoid spending more money for an original. So far I think it was a very good purchase. Greetings!"
"It is what I expected according to the description of the product, had a generic box, well packed, charger (5W) and generic cable, does not include audiophones, tegngo using it two weeks and all well so far, already updated to 14.5, the screen and the back well, some stripes and blows in the corners. Horn, entrances and camera well, the maximum capacity of the battery was 94%, now it is 93, I only disappoint the battery (that is why the 4 stars), in general I would recommend it."
"very good only scrapes on the side and the charger is of very poor quality, it should integrate a certified"
"The phone is only in excellent condition, the battery reached 90%. It is an excellent phone"
"The quality is premium as the ad says, only the shipping payment if it is more expensive in this application than in others"
"The phone arrives in good condition, the battery condition reached 92% the only bad thing is the charger says it is the one to wear but looks very bad warm as well as the cable."
"Cell phone is the best I've ever had, battery life is a bestiality 10/10"
"Good equipment but does not come 3n its original packaging and does not have the original charger."
"Excellent product! I arrived with a 97% battery life now I have 94 two months later. But in functional 10/10 very nice as new! If you are looking for a phone for a reasonable price it is your choice. :)"
"The team arrived super well only with a couple of scratches on the screen but nothing to worry about, everything else is very well, the stack is at 91%"
"99% battery, original components, completely impeccable, I highly recommend it."
"I've been using it for 1 day, so far it arrived well, it has no details, more than a few scratches on the screen, if you're very demanding, I don't recommend it, but if you can pass a few scratches, it's perfect, 100% recommended The battery comes with 88%"
"93% battery condition. No failure."
"Because they do not ensure the correct functioning of these renewed? equipment is the second that I receive with the same fault, the first plane was not heard and in this case it is heard very low, forcing to open the speaker to hold a phone call, obviously this is not always possible. I need to change it to one that works correctly."
"All right, with small usage marks, but nothing exaggerated..."
"The ratio of quality to price is very good, but I must admit that the charger with which the phone comes, is generic and has no hearing aids, so if we do the sum of those two items is approximately 3,000 pesos you have to add to the final value of the computer. Just for your information."
"I bought it recently but until today everything perfect, it warms up a bit when charging but I guess it is normal, aesthetic 10, cameras 10, everything goes very well I like very much . I hope it continues like this"
"All good customer service who kindly attended a request"
"Excellent 91% battery without scratches On screen or anywhere, I am waiting only for the invoice and out of which the charger is not original I am totally delighted that the device arrived in such good condition."
"The price is still high to be a team that has changed parts"
"The team is super good, it works perfectly without problems, without crashed everything very well. The only thing you should be aware of is the pile to me came with 88% but it has been lasting me the stack and full day"
"The phone came with 87% battery and aesthetics of 10 had no scratches only that they send it in generic box and generic chargers my purchase was with recommended clevermex"
"It came in generic box with a charger of another brand but with the plus that is fast charging, (charger that Apple does not give you when you buy the phone by the way). The phone is practically new with battery life at 100%. I guess it’s lucky because this cell phone arrived impeccable but I also bought a silver iPhone xs and that cell came worn off from the sides, minimal stripes on the screen and battery at 81%. I don’t know what it depends on..."
"Very good as new only they sent old charger"
"It came a bit scratchy but they disguise it with a mica and it warmed up, but when it was updated the overheating was composed, and the scratches were minimal details"
"Excellent product arrived in less than 2 days, aesthetic 9.8 since the battery had 87%, small scratches but nothing to worry about. The truth is highly recommended"
"The cell phone is as if it were new, not unique is that to me it arrived with 86% stack and the cable and the cube is generic, but in the other aspects I recommend it"
"Even now I work excellently well the battery lasts me 2 days. My question is whether it is waterproof."
"I just have a week with equipment, so far everything is fine. I had stayed quite behind, had an Iphone 6s plus and an 8 Plus, so I am happy with the change. Considering that I am only interested in basic social media and photos functions, I am satisfied with the purchase. The battery arrived with a maximum capacity at 96% which is very reasonable for the price. I update reviews in a couple of months."
"I had a pleasant experience with the completely original device and with all functions at 100%, and with very good percentage of battery life, without screen scratches or cameras, I highly recommend it as new"
"It's the best purchase I could have made, it came to me with 95 battery, impeccable, aesthetic of 10, DEFINITIVELY I'D BUY IT BACK"
"Bad quality charger, but the product very well"
"The phone comes with generic charger, does not come in original box. The phone came to me with mica and the percentage of life of the battery is 88%. Aesthetically it looks like new and I do not see any detail, everything works correctly."
"The cell phone arrived in very good condition and works like new!"
"The truth was that I distrusted the refurbished teams, but I've already been with my team for a couple of weeks and it really feels like new. It arrived well, quickly, without conflict, with very good aesthetics. Super recommended."
"The only detail is that the battery life is very low 85% I am disappointed, try to return the product but did not leave me. First and last time I buy refurbished equipment."
"It's perfect, it works like new."
"In the mica that brings up much of the scratches that brings the screen, it will change but will be many problems for the information that I have already put to the phone, you have to take more care of the aesthetics of the screens of these phones, why while they are used they must manage quality in them."
"I have only been in use for a week, but the phone as new as it is completely, both physically and functionally. I highly recommend it, it came with 100% battery, without any physical detail and released for any company (I use Telcel) has Apple care in force of one month from delivery (at least so in my case)."
"Super well taken care of I arrived in aesthetics, all well until the 3rd week that the unlambric loading system began to fail me. I returned it but I will order another one."
"I arrive with battery at 91% not a single scratch seems new, a bargain the price very very happy with the purchase"
"I liked that the team came with an excellent presentation. If I had brought original charger it would have been 10 out of 10"
"I arrive in time and shape!! It looks cute!! Obviously it is renewed do not expect that the aesthetic is 10 but if it reaches the 9 screen and back 10 without scratches the obvious shore is the one that has small pekeños but everything perfect!! The happy truth works at 100I had a normal 11 pro but I wanted the biggest screen! But I do not plan to spend a million on the new 12 is a scam that is why I decided to buy the 11proMax and I like it very much!! Cameras loudspeakers alloooo!! It works well!!I will use it and then update them I hope it does not present failures!!No original box does not bring hearing aids and the charger is generic but it is 2.1 and compatible is appreciated!! I put photo!!I am happy with the purchase!!Good price-quality!!!"
"Everything excellent came to me with an 89% battery without any scratches take away the mica that it brings to see if it brings scratches the screen brought one but it is not seen when putting the tempered glass and without the crystal you have to look well to the reflection of the Light so that it is noticed I totally recommend it with charger and generic box that at the end of the day that does not worry me because I carry it with its original charger"
"The cell phone looks like new! It arrived perfectly packed. I am very happy with my purchase. Until today it works perfectly and gives me a lot of peace of mind that has a guarantee of a year! I wanted to hope to try it to give my review and if I would buy it again because thus we contribute to care our environment! It feels like new!"
"Face ID not working"
"The team came to me with 87 battery is very well taken care of, I was afraid to buy it for some reviews but I recommend it 100%"
"In perfect aesthetic and functional conditions. Battery status in 91%. It came with cable and charger (generic) that work very well. I have been with the phone for 1 week, until now everything ok."
"The Media Could Not Be Loaded. I loved it from start to finish!!! I can't believe that even if it is renovated it has the battery 100% and with no aesthetic detail, it even comes with a mica and it has never opened because it still has the seal against the water (verified with the barometer) and all its parts are obviously original (verified with a program, the battery only tenka 30 cycles) for a lot less money than it costs, it's really amazing"
"I loved it from start to finish!!! I can't believe that even if it is renovated it has the battery 100% and with no aesthetic detail, it even comes with a mica and it has never opened because it still has the seal against the water (verified with the barometer) and all its pieces are obviously original (verified with a program, the battery only tenka 30 cycles) for far less money than it costs, it is truly amazing"
"I've been using it for a week, all right so far, the battery came with 100% conditions, no details, no scratches. brought cable and charger."
"The product is perfect, although the first time I ordered it they sent me some wet wipes and I had to ask for my refund, the customer service from Amazon is perfect. I bought it again and finally came the product I asked for. The phone came with 93 battery but I hope that with the weeks of use it will caliber and increase. The aesthetic is impeccable in my case and everything working in order. Super recommended, but for you to make the purchase it tracks the lowest price and be patient!"
"The cell phone was totally blocked as if it were new, it came with generic accessories as the description says, aesthetically it has an 8 out of 10"
"It is understood that it is a reconditioned product and it is not entirely new, but at least in my case, it came to me with a screen with enough small scratches (the previous owner sure left it with the screen on the floor) and in the description it says that they should not be practically null or null. What I did not like is that they try to hide it by putting a protective mica so that it seems that it does not have scratches, and it is something misleading. It is not bad product but in my opinion I recommend that if they buy it, they remove that mica to see the real conditions in which they send it."
"At first I was afraid that the product would not arrive, for cases that have occurred, or that the product would be bad until it was original, but all excellent, the equipment seems new, without faults"
"Good price."
"I arrived with a blow on the metal frame that left a mark as a bubble type near the camera in addition to several deep scratches , it brought a mica of glass poorly placed, for the price and in that state it was not worth it"
"I've changed my address many times when you order this iPhone, but it was delivered to my old direction and it makes me a lot of trouble. I mean Amazon's service has problems. iPhone is excellent."
"I thought it was good product, it came to me with 87 and I had a medium use the normal and I could endure the day and if it happened I would carry it"
"For the question of price quality I give you a 10, I've been using it for more than 4 months and it's working for perfeccion and without details."
"Good product looks new"
"The phone arrived in time and form. It’s like new in terms of aesthetics and functioning."
"Excellent compra reached me today to 91% of life and Literal seems new I hope and have no problems later I loved"
"The team well! I came a bit scratched thing that is not notified, but out of that it has no problem or problem, with the savings that I had sincerely I am satisfied. I already have some time with the phone and I have no problem, except for the scratches! The phone is the maximum like all the apple products"
"The iPhone comes with 91% battery without scratches or strokes, definitely excellent purchase."
"At least to me, my device arrived with a deep rallion and percentage of battery at 88%. When I contacted to return it because I didn’t want to have it like that, I was only offered 10 USD as compensation"
"My cell phone arrived very scratched and with only 80% in the battery life. I am thinking of returning it, although the system has served well, the aesthetic is like 6. If it is risk. The quality price is not comparable, it is luck."
"Without scratches, the color and capacity chosen, aesthetically as new, without blows or scratches, the battery 86%, without box, comes charger and generic cable, but for the price, highly recommended, reached me in 2 weeks or little less."
"The team arrived practically new, very good purchase. Only the stack would have liked it to arrive like the previous one up 92%, this one arrived at 85%. But everything excellent."
"The equipment got me damaged, the camera doesn't work properly aesthetically is an 8 but being reconditioned is understandable"
"I arrived with quality of 9 because I only had a few minimum scrapes on the banks, the pile arrived with 85 so it seems very good, I have been trying it for 4 days and I do not regret the purchase the battery lasts me all the excellent day!!"
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, aesthetically 10/10, and in terms of the operation everything very well."
"I sincerely expected less and surprised me 512 GB in perfect condition pulling perfect, 97% battery all working perfectly, all right cameras all excellent! Cable and generic charging center but for the price save those luxuries and compensate it with 512 GB I find excellent !"
"I arrive with 87% battery not bad and only a few ralls on the screen with the mica does not notice anything for the price is good"
"The charger I came with only worked 1 month, and I stop serving you and you buy another, I think you should check out the extra components very well. The phone if I fill all my expectations"
"Aesthetics of 100, as new, recommended."
"Everything perfect a few slight brands of use in the area of cameras but aesthetic of 9.5 I would say, I arrive with 100% battery life, I will have to return it because my bank does not respect the promotion of reimbursement in state of account :( it is a pity but if I recommend it"
"I had my doubts about being an Amazon renewed product but I took a risk and it was a good decision, arrived in excellent conditions Highly recommended"
"The aesthetic of 9.5 quite good condition the product, the battery completely exceeded my expectations."
"It's a used equipment so the battery doesn't reach 100, but other than that it works wonderfully, physically it has almost no detail, the box, the cable and the charger are generic but for the price is very good"
"At first the phone arrived with scratches is normal because it is renewed and because it is obvious that someone else used it, but just yesterday I no longer pull the Face ID and it came out a green stripe to the screen and it turns off and turns on the screen when it wants how good it can process the refund since Amazon gives you 90 days of guarantee. I hope the others if they have done very well their equipment is only my particular case."
"The phone is excellent as if it were new, you don't notice the difference, and it has 92 percent performance in the battery."
"I'm surprised how well preserved I got, so far without any detail. The only bad thing is the charger and cable."
"Being a remanufactured product I was aware that I would have some wear and tear or defects. Unfortunately, as I uncovered it, I had the unpleasant surprise that it was quite scratched from the screen and had several hits on the banks of the metal frame as well as on the cameras. The scratches were too deep. Unfortunately, I was out of my home for a long time. So when I returned and checked the Product I lost the return time. I ended up spending more on changing the damaged Glass on the phone. The condition of the battery reached 87% and to date it has been maintained. Personally I did not buy renewed again."
"It's good product only that some primordial applications like whatsaop get stuck and slow to open"
"I use it for everything, the best thing is that I could accommodate one line of att in the form of a virtual chip, and another of telcel in the physical chip, and I no longer require two devices. I am really very happy with the equipment, excellent photos and videos as well"
"After 15 days of continuous use it works as a new product"
"The screen was very grated, these scratches affected the front camera and the battery life was very bad"
"Physically arrived in excellent condition, without a single rayon. Perfect operation. It’s how new."
"The only detail you have against is a battery with 85% life, otherwise, great phone"
"The product is in very good condition, without any scratch or stroke, it is in a condition of 10 and the battery reached me with 99% , although not everything was quite well since days before I had ordered the color space gray and lost me the package, although that was already a question of the parcel but as for the phone I had my doubts for comments that I read and the truth is that I do not regret, until now everything working well and perfectly"
"The equipment came to me in impeccable condition. It looks like new, has no aesthetic details. It works perfectly. It came to me with 98% battery life. Recommended to 100."
"The excellent product, unfortunately I was assaulted, I would like to know if you can provide me with the number of imei to block it please. Thank you"
"It's very good!!"
"You have your reservations when you make this kind of purchases, however every time the suppliers are getting better and that's the joke that they are giving more and more confidence. It's the second time I do it, the time I spent with Iphone 8, it was fine, but this time, it was better for me. I hope you have even, a better experience."
"Aesthetic at 100, good quality price. No complaints."
"Very sad pr than a year after the computer was running, the screen stopped responding without any cause."
"Excellent supplier is the third team I ask with the same supplier"
"It took me long to write the review to see if the iPhone had any flaws and to this day everything incredible, I arrived with good battery (99%) without any imperfection (raptures, stains or blows) unlocked for any company and without problems with iCloud. In a nutshell perfect."
"I arrive with your generic box and charger, but the equipment physically at 100, battery at 100, delivery time next day, msi."
"The device came as new with a battery at 89%, you can only appreciate a few small scratches on the screen near the camera, however, out of that detail it looks like a new phone, the charger is generic and the truth did not give me much confidence, I preferred to use the one already had."
"Only for the battery but excellent the truth. I still last long enough for the charge."
"It came as new; it has no scratches in the housing or on the screen, it works very well, the battery came with 95% of its operation."
"I am very happy with the purchase, the cell phone arrived in excellent condition, the days have passed since I bought it and I am 100% satisfied. I must say that when it came to me, I was not very happy because it did not come in its original box or its accessories, since opening an iphone in its packaging is also a great experience."
"The truth was doubtful if I would buy it, but I was pleasantly surprised, it has no detail of aesthetics, the performance is perfect, the battery comes to 100%It has certainly been a very good purchase.In addition they have months without interest and arrived sooner than I expected."
"The media could not be loaded. I hope it was just bad luck. The iPhone was spotless even bringing a mica for the screen and with 94% condition. I set it up and used it for a week. I had had a bit of trouble with Telcel’s signal but it was fixed only (who knows how). The problem was that a week later the screen went green, then it took off and I felt relief, but it went green again and so it was green. I liked it very much but I had to return it. Fortunately I could erase my data. I was waiting for the refund. I bought others and I had never passed this from the green screen."

I had really liked it but I had to return it. Fortunately I could erase my data. I was waiting for the refund. I bought others and I had never passed this from the green screen."
"Well the phone, its battery with 89% but well and careful to be renovated without problems of operation or other things I recommend, the price well to months and cobla confidence that Amazon answers you"
"I consider that if the price was somewhat high."
"The truth was what I expected, it exceeded my expectation as I arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled, I called the attention that the cell phone already came even with tempered glass protector, of course that I would buy again, knowing that they are good products and above all guaranteed, if you save a few thousand pesos in Mexico regarding its NEW value."
"I have two weeks using it. It came in another package but that’s the least, since so far it has worked wonderfully and even reached me with the protective screen mica as extra, being that they cost very expensive. I would definitely buy reconditioned products again on Amazon. Totally a 100% ecological purchase. I do not regret the purchase."
"The iPhone gets very hot when it is used and comes with a glass mica, takes it off to put a mica mate and what was my surprise “THE RAYED AND TALLED PANTAL” has many scratches and heels, they put the mica to disguise its state. I’m about to return it"
"The team arrived with what it indicates, how the screen is very grated, which was tried to cover with a glass protector."
"I liked it very much, I arrived in very good condition, the battery at 90% and with protective glass. It does not include charger or original box, but for the cost and promotion of MSI it is worth it!"
"I had my doubts since I have always bought things directly in apple, the truth very well the performance and aesthetics of 100, I have been a month with him and everything in order, I arrive with 94% in battery life! Good purchase to my mind"
"I liked it very much, it came in excellent condition and with a 94% battery, with a mica and no scratches of anything."
"I had my doubts reviewing all the comments but in the end it cheers me up and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the product, no punch or scratch also came to me with the condition of stack of 98%, it is worth it and if you do not like the way it comes you can always return it"
"Luxury, I highly recommend it!"
"A real pity when it comes to opening the package, you're always looking forward to releasing a new or used team but the illusion became frustrating to see that only instructions came from the refurbished team and a generic charger, I think it's a serious disrespect to do that kind of thing and I don't justify it in any way, the only good thing about all this was that if I got the refund, 20 days after the purchase and I had no cell phone and no money for those long 20 days of distress, I hope and serve you this comment and you don't have the same thing happen to you."
"Excellent value for money"
"The product came without aesthetic details, working optimally, including the 89% face id and stacked. However, by updating to iOS 15 it found that the screen was not the original one. It is a screen that was not even OLED."
"The phone really looks new, except the detail of the battery that brings an 86% capacity and that brings protective mica (which obviously a new computer does not bring), the phone is impeccable. I have 10 months with it and everything goes well."
"The iPhone arrived well, works well, aesthetic 10/10 but arrived with 90% battery :/"
"I'm in good shape."
"The equipment arrived in excellent condition, the box without any defects and the accessories (generic) in the same way without any defects. It arrived with an aesthetic 10/10, without any front or rear rayon. The battery life reached 96% The equipment works excellent, made its update of IOS without any problem. A purchase that was worth every penny and the equipment is practically new."
"Excellent battery, aesthetic just a few slight hits on the screen but there is in newer I liked very much"
"The cell phone arrived before the estimated time, it is in perfect condition and everything as promised. Highly recommended!"
"Meet my expectations regarding the price. Good conditionsBattery at 98A slight scratch on the screen but out of that fine"
"excellent, I arrived well packaged although with some labels badly glued but to see that was the least since I arrived well piled to 100% without features of use, the vdd is very satisfied of the purchase!!"
"I got an equipment completely in excellent condition, visually and internally, the battery has 100% quality so delighted.It was a counter equipment, but little manipulated.I arrived in conditions again, zero scratches, zero strokes!, without hesitation I would buy it again."
"I liked that the team still had Apple care, which had mica and had no visible stroke, I didn't like that it didn't come to 100 the battery and that it didn't have its original charger and cable since the price given by the team is high little more and you buy the 12 Max pro"
"It didn't bring any aesthetic details and on the screen not on the back, and as the publication says it doesn't bring original accessories and the battery came to me with 84%, very good purchase"
"The cell phone works perfectly and has no details. At least I haven’t found it. As they mention the battery status obviously isn’t 100% but by functional issues everything is excellent."
"THE TELEPHONE CALLS ON THE 3 MONTHS, THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF GUARANTEE OR ANYTHING, TAKES HIM TO REPLACE AND DOESN'T SERVE THE BASEBAND, UNSERVED FOR ALWAYS"
"I arrive with 100% battery and with scratches the screen... after a month of use with maniatic care and charging with new original charge, under the condition of battery to 93%, rare truth? At least that they put it generical battery or something similar ... alfinal decided to return it, I don't want to think with how much comes percentage after the year of use..."
"The product arrived in excellent aesthetic conditions, except for a detail on the screen (a small rayon)."
"I am very surprised with the product. It is my first purchase of a reconditioned in Amazon and the truth came out very good. The iPhone has aesthetics of 10, I arrived with good percentage of battery. It looks new literal. I recommend the seller and the product. The only thing that I did not like were the chargers since in the announcement it came out with the original chargers."
"The cell phone came to me with scratched cameras, scratched screen and the worst with the loudspeakers covered with dirt, so much dirt that nothing is heard when I speak on the phone. I expected more than Amazon quality standards."
"It's cheap but you risk a lot, I got bad luck. The screen when tilting the cell phone shows non-original colors and is not of the same image quality"
"You can't tell it was a renewal, everything works 100%."
"An excellent purchase. The equipment arrived as new, only without its original box and original accessories, as even with a mica that 5 months later still retained. It arrived with 7 months warranty still (Apple care), battery at 97% and brings new product serial number, not of renewed. Recommended 100%, I have been 5 months with the"
"The phone came in very good condition, only tiny scratches on the screen, the rest of the phone was like new. No internal part has been changed and its battery was at 95%. The only bad thing is the charger that includes, is generic, I do not recommend it to be used, as it could damage the battery. And I already have two months with it and it works perfectly !"
"The cell phone is spotless, it has no visible physical damage, it arrived super fast and even now it has not had any faults of any kind. The stack is at 92%I think it is very worth it I am very happy with my purchase."
"I was nervous because I was getting a very cheap price, as well as reading reviews that they could come without serving or scratches, but still I decided to take the risk. I couldn’t have made a better decision, it’s impeccable. Not a single rayon and its battery at 100%."
"the phone arrived in perfect condition, impeccable the bad thing about buying that type of phone is that they are not equipped with the frequency of 28 mobile data, which is necessary to support phone companies as it is bait, pillofon, the megacable, etc, you limit yourself only to telcel, att, unefon and those of that style, if you don't care about those more economic phones, it is a very good option"
"I was really terrified of buying a reconditioning cell phone but I've been using it for two weeks now and I haven't had the slightest problem. The phone didn't have any aesthetic or functional details. 99% battery and it doesn't bring original cables or hearing aids but honestly if that's why it's going to cost half, I don't have any problem. Excellent shopping! I'd do it again."
"Very father. Excellent photos. Fast and great"
"It is what they offer, I arrive before the planned, very good purchase and very good product.Congratulations to the company"
"I arrive in good condition and with more than 90% stack in general good purchase only that does not come with original charger and comes in generic box"
"It comes as indicated, the iPhone in excellent condition, with established specifications, battery life to 100. The cable and charger is generic as set. The bad thing is that the charger is very low amperage and takes an eternity to charge, I believe by putting generic charger could include a fast charging one."
"To be used and okay, it came to me with 90% battery life, a little bit of scratches but it works well"
"I arrived from Estetica of 10, but the screen if it was very grated I put a glass mica and problem solved but a month began to fail me the Face ID and I had to return it, how strange that the next day they were already selling it again because they had it as a product exhausted, not if it was coincidence or it earned them that it failed and put it again for sale"
"The product is like new, works 100%. It comes in a generic packaging with a generic charger and generic charging cable, but the phone is 100% original and comes very well protected."
"It's okay the phone without problems, the only bad thing are the accessories."
"I loved the phone, excellent conditions, 97% battery, delivery in the specified time, responded to my concerns very quickly, I recommend it very much!"
"I arrive in perfect condition, as new!"
"The butria reached 85%, after 2 weeks it went down to 84%. It had two circular marks on the screen that were noticed against light. The holes look dirty. It warmed up a lot and half tarnished the crystal mica. The performance and function was correct But I did not like the heating and so many physical details. Fortunately this option to return. I really expected more."
"It has faults on the screen and suddenly the phone does not react, which became visible from the third month of use"
"It came completely new. With 100% maximum battery, I feel very satisfied with my purchase, it doesn’t have a single scratch, it works all 100. Only the charger and the cable if they are super chafas, but around the cell phone this new one."
"Very good truth only small details but it's normal"
"I bought it and the day I checked it the camera and the horn were not good. It came with several scratches too obvious.It came in a box like egg Jajaja should have a better presentation so that the cell phone is not damaged anymore.The only good thing was that Amazon reimbursed me the payment without problem."
"It comes super careful, no detail and came to me with 96% battery, the bad thing is that it comes with a generic cable and no cube."
"At first I doubted whether to buy a refurbished phone or not but finally I was encouraged and the vdd is that I do not regret it, the phone arrived in perfect condition and in time, it only has one or two small scratches on the screen but in the day to day they do not notice, everything works perfect, I have a few days with the device and everything is excellent."
"I thought it was an excellent purchase."
"The phone works without problems.The bad thing is that the screen came with many scratches.In fact it had a protector on it so that one did not notice.Also it has as black plumon indelible in the frame of the phone."
"It fascinated me, totally looks like new, super tiny scratches on the banks that are hardly seen, perfect conditions so far everything perfect, charge very fast and has 99% life battery  I charmed, so far perfect"
"The order arrived two days earlier than announced, the phone is completely impeccable one would think it is new. The battery has 93% but it is Perfect!, the delivery method is great with its Amazon Renewed direct box"
"Excellent product, came to me with battery of %98The only complaint would be with the cable and charger that took a long time to charge.It brought mica and not a single detail of blows or wear.I highly recommend it"
"It is a good product, arrived without any aesthetic damage, with battery life to 92% and functionally I have no complaints. Recommended!"
"Very good purchase"
"Excellent product!!!I had my doubts about the label “renewed” but it was worth every penny.Product without aesthetic details and with 96% battery, the only bad point I would put it is the charger since it is not the original but for the price I can not complain"
"Personally I do not like that all over the frame has details, especially because it mentions that they will not be seen one hand away, but it looks. Plus. It does not distinguish so much in photo but in person yes. I think I would not ask for another."
"Recommended by the seller, the phone came with 100% battery and even with screen protector.A few details on the frames but nothing considerable.It is part of luck but much influence the reviews of the seller."
"The battery has a 90% usage which is not bad for the model, the accessories only comes the charger and is not original, but for the price is a good product"
"It arrived very scratched from the sides but nothing that a good case does not solve, in terms of functionality everything perfect and the pile to 97%."
"I doubted about buying a reconditioned phone, but this one overwhelms all my expectations."
"The quality of the stack, I'm barely two months old and I've got 90% taken care of when I load it."
"The screen comes very scratched and deep scratches"
"He doesn't bring the tray where the chip is placed and he has some scratches on the screen the generic accessories and the same box in the description said he looked like new that's fake."
"The cell phone arrived in good condition, its battery above 90%, so far running the equipment at 100. Without hesitation I would buy it again with this seller."
"I've only been with him for a couple of weeks, but I don't have any complaints right now. The phone's in excellent condition."
"The cell phone got hit, I decided to keep it because it is a heavy expense and I have no way to check that the cell phone had arrived hit and it had not been me. I realized until I took it out of the package. I bought a similar cell phone at Walmart and everything was excellent, I decided to give the seller the opportunity on Amazon, but they totally failed."
"I expected a little more aesthetics on the team, it arrives scratched and with blows it is understandable for the price but to be honest if you are already going to invest in this team put it a little more and buy a new one, I would have done it."
"I just got here, I already installed everything, I'm using it and I give it a 100/100. It came perfect aesthetics too."
"This iphone came with a small scratch a little visible on the bottom left and the battery at 93% overall all well, but it went off."
"I really liked that I received an almost impeccable team in physical conditions."
"The phone is in perfect condition, does not bring any details and I loved the transparency of the publication"
"What I don't like is that I can't buy you any data packets, they're reduced plans and they're more expensive."
"The cell phone comes in excellent condition, almost as new. It didn’t come with any scratches or anything, it includes screen mica and the battery status was 92% and it still lasts a lot. I’m very happy with the purchase."
"So far, without any problems, it has worked 100%. Practically impeccable, a single detail on the screen, but really imperceptible."
"Good quality, good priceJust a few scratches on screen, the rest impeccable, 100% good performance"
"The cell phone looked perfect until I tried to turn it on. I noticed that the ignition button was half-deep and I had to press it more than normal to respond. This is a very obvious flaw. I was disappointed that this failure was not detected by Amazon as indicated in the description of its Reconditioned products where they claim to check the products earlier. It’s a shame since the rest of the team was in very good condition. I’ll return it immediately as I can’t accept it."
"I arrived in perfect condition with 97% battery all perfect"
"I had to return it the same day it came to me, I bought it earlier with BuySpry (in another account) and I had never gone wrong, however this equipment was getting very hot using WhatsApp alone and had ghost touches. However I just ordered another team with them."
"The device I received in excellent external condition just as its operation is excellent has been a purchase that has left me very satisfied regarding profit price thanks"
"In general fine but I had 2 scratches on the screen quite noticeable so I chose to return it, I still WAITING FOR MY RETURN..."
"It comes in excellent condition, the vdd doesn't seem recovered and so far everything works super well"
"Aesthetics of 10, without scratches, the only detail that has 91% battery capacity but I think very good for the price and be renewed, very good way to save and get some quality"
"They should be more rigorous in their quality standards of renewed products in Mexico since this problem did not happen to me with U.S. products, nothing recommended, is the second that I have to return"
"It arrived the next day. Aesthetically it is almost perfect, holding it at a distance of 10 cm is imperceptible any defect. I have used it about a month as my main phone and has not had any fault, the battery lasts approximately 48 hours."
"Super recommended, zero aesthetic details appreciable, battery in more than 85%, the included accessories are bad, but sure you have at home if you make this purchase. The particular iPhone that was sent to me even has still current coverage of AppleCare+!!!! I do not regret this purchase at all."
"Equipment with generic parts! It was detected when it was upgraded to the IOS 15, the equipment is impeccable only that slight malfunction"
"The product arrived in excellent condition and even with tempered glass mica and all the thing, battery to 99 and not a rayon on the body or screen, I am happy with my purchase"
"The phone came flawless I have a few days using it and everything has been great shopping!"
"Good product better than I expected"
"Excellent. I liked, 100% stack, as the aesthetics a 10"

"Practically new"
"The phone is in excellent condition, without any damage and works well, I have already used it for several months.The battery is 90% and lasts all day without problem."
"The media could not be loaded. Well it was a flying that expected to win haja, 94% stack, but I think it is considerably mistreated, which was not noticed with tempered glass, yet I will take the decision to give it a chance to the functioning of the team waiting for it to be the optimal."
"Well, it was a blowout that I was hoping to win, 94% stack, but I think it's considerably mistreated, which wasn't noticeable with the tempered glass, yet I'm going to take the decision to give the team a chance to run waiting for it to be the optimal."
"In perfect condition, aesthetic of 10 had only a small detail on one edge. % battery life with 94, arrived at the time mentioned, and the cell phone came with a protective mica."

"It's not worth it. The cell phone came to me in very good condition and working perfect, at 2 months the Face ID stopped working and to repair it you have to invest another 5,000 pesos. Don't buy it."
"Don't buy BuySpry, on the edges I had bumps and scrapes, just as I came with a glass mica to cover deep scratches on the display, regarding the price it makes me very unfair because at first sight the equipment had already been used for a long time. in the description it mentions that it is in good condition but it is not so."

"It's broken from the sides."
"It came as new, it works all including the Face ID, with a 92% condition in the battery which I think is perfect. I have already been with him for 1 month and has not failed anything and the screen looks excellent. It is a very good purchase for the price."
"I arrived as new. Light scratch on the corner of the screen, but generally quite well.The generic charger, I thought it would be bad, but it is quite fast and compatible to 100% I recommend it."
"I did more than well with my phone, came without details, I highly recommend it."

"The media could not be loaded. I do not recommend buying this type of equipment, you risk not getting it as it was my case. The box came only with the generic charger and a charging cable, plus the box where the phone would supposedly be was broken from the ""security seal"", definitely save yourself the trouble whether it comes to nothing or the equipment gets in bad shape, go to the safe and buy something new."

"Don’t buy Amazon’s refurbished devices, mine stopped working after 3 months of purchase, took it to an authorized apple center and told me that I had hardware problems (I didn’t have any physical problems) so I had to communicate with Amazon directly, however they comment that the warranty expired and there’s nothing they can do. They should check that the equipment they sell is devices with reliability and not equipment that after 3 months will stop serving. Very disappointing customer attention and product quality."

In optimal condition, without scratches on the screen or on the bright sides. Everything works perfectly Ah and even with screen guard came! The generic white box in which it came was a little flimsy, but the phone was well protected inside. Charger and generic cable, but you have to understand that it is a refurbished computer. I am using it in Venezuela with Movistar and it goes great.If you are thinking about buying this equipment, it is an excellent decision.

"The only thing I didn't like was that in a corner it came like a stick, I could clean it carefully but it's like I had brush bristles that I had to take out carefully, from there everything in order"

I thought I could fix it once I set it up, but finish copying my phone to this one I bought the Face ID still didn't work.

Physically only come a rayon in its housing on the top left, by the color it does not notice much, but everything else the equipment is in good condition."
"The iphone arrived fast, in an Amazon box with a certificate of quality and inspection, it has a one year warranty and looks completely new, new generic cable and charger. The battery with 93% life. I highly recommend the products RECONDITIONED PREMIUM as these are supported by Amazon."

"The phone in general is fine although it has a very striking rayon on the screen, the only thing that if I was very upset compared to other comments is that it only counted with 81% of life the pile, when others count that it comes even with 95, 96% approx."
"The product seems totally new the only problem was the standard of living of the battery arrived with 79% but still lasts me all day, 100% recommended to be delighted"
"The equipment is refurbished but comes impeccable, everything completely new and original"
"It arrived well sealed and in a generic box. It has some aesthetic details like some scratches on the chrome, but from there on out, everything works and perfectly. If you buy it on offer, you will not regret it. Because it is re-conditioning, it may have some details."
"Good product"
"It is a device that stands out in the vast majority of situations, with good camera quality, battery, screen, compact size and sound. However what you should talk about is the reconditioned devices, it was my first experience buying, but for my luck it was pleasantly satisfying, as you see in the photos it is a device that came with its tracks of use, even some fall that could have suffered but after almost two months testing the device has worked as new. As for the battery if I arrived with 84% of battery which I did not like but with the discount for which I bought it little I could say, Apple offers change of the battery at $1700 therefore it could be that expense to consider, however in two months it has dropped 1% the percentage of the battery and in its current state it gives me around 6 hours of screen for which I give myself almost all day, if necessary I recommend to wait for it to reach 80% of status in the battery for its change, and really as it is going to easily last a whole year with that battery. On the other hand I recommend analyzing the serial number and download it 3Utools to make it for me to make your own review, I recommend you even the original ones case."
"I bought it to give it to my mom, arrived apparently well, without scratches or signs of much use. The battery capacity was 82% (which fulfills what was promised in the publication), the theme is that it warms up a little after a few minutes of use and the location by gps is very intermittent and inaccurate."
"No details, I got almost new. 95% stack and everything running 100% in this first week of use."
"I got steticame you impeccable, everything works very well and the battery I consider is in good condition 86%. Highly recommended"
"As new, excellent conditions and excellent packaging overwhelm my expectations, obviously for being reconditioned do not expect the original iPhone box but for the price it is worth, the boxes end up pulling."
"I only arrived with a small scrape or wear on the corner ... I bare the chrome but nothing important ... I expected more rallones or problems ... What I cared about was the operation ... But to date everything is going well... I arrive with 100 of battery, I recommend it if you are looking for something nice nice and cheap.... Seeing this I think I will never encourage myself to buy a new phone... The truth come as new and with warranty... Pocaa but a particular seller does not give guarantee or financing to msi"
"Update: Wilmer, of customer service, helped me to manage the return considering the 90-day warranty. I could not be more satisfied with Amazon. However the product I received is still equally bad, so I only raised the rating a little bit. The reasons for my assessment so low are: Dim state: - Lighting connector stuck with fluff and dirt. Same the speakers - Rayons in the comb that are visible, - Rayons in the corners of the phone that are evident to an arm of distance. - 84% battery but it drains completely in less than half day (not connected to 8 by 12 of the day it is dead), - It is heated when charging via cable, - It is further heated when charging via wireless, - Without having ever used it (in these two months) in humid environments or wet, it is frequent to mark alert of ""water in the connector"" ... so I stay without battery and I can not charge it for hours - The Face ID encounters and I have to disable it (in these two months) in humid environments or wet, use it, it is frequent to mark alert of ""water in the connector of the connector of the connector of the connector of the connector of the connector ... ... so that I will not be able to make it again to enable it to me to me to Amazon and I leave it without battery and I can not charge it for hours - The Face ID - I find it - The Face ID - I have it - The Face ID - I have it - I have it - I have it not used for hours and I have it again find it - without having it - I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it - in these two months) never used it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it, I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have it I have"
"I liked that it comes in good quality, except the battery has 84% but for the price it is worth"
"A very good team meets the expectations all well with it I recommend to acquire"
"Aesthetics 10/10 came to me with battery capacity to 100 is totally recommended"
"The truth had heard a lot about the refurbished ones and I had some fear that I would not receive a product in good condition, which was my great surprise I got the Iphoneen generic plasticized box as if it were from the factory, when it was taken out of the box I was fascinated the Iphone came as new without any scratch anywhere, nor on screen, very well cared the battery 92% I have already 20 days with it and it has not failed me for anything the first days for reasons of work for more or less a week I had to give it a very intense use with the network sharing data with my laptop which in all the cellulars causes to warm up too much and the batteries are exhausted faster it happened in all this was not the exception what happened q if I charged it a day and a half and that I am intense user of twitter, facebook, instagram tik tok what consumes it more quickly than the battery share data it did once in the day can still pass very well those tests of intense use, I also made validations with iutools everything is original to be replaced including the performance of the battery to the same"
"Good value for money"
"That is in optimal condition and that works well the Apps"
"It arrived earlier than scheduled Excellent packaging Battery at 100% of its capacity Generic accessories No aesthetic details SIM use pending Up to the moment very satisfied."
"Good product for the paid"
"It is an excellent purchase, I arrived without aesthetic details, with a mica already included and battery to 98% undoubtedly 10/10"
"I have 3 weeks with the equipment, it works well, the battery hard Perfect. The charger that I get is generic but works well on fast charge. The only theme is that it brings a visible rayon in a corner."
"In general it comes in good condition, the detail is in the battery that comes to 83%, which, it may not be profitable for me in the future, as I will have to change it and it is not very cheap. Now I will have to think if I should change it or keep it."
"I think we were all afraid to buy a refurbished phone but in my experience it is a very good way to save money and take care of the environment The phone does not present details more described (small scrapes) very happy with my purchase"
"I arrive well packaged, it brings generic but functional accessories (Cable and charger). The screen has slight scratches that do not interfere in the operation of the device, are few perceptible to the eye, nothing that is not solved with a tempered mica or screen protector. The lower right corner has a scratch, nothing that is not solved with a case (Case, protector...). The health of the battery is 84%, not bad for a 2019 computer, the duration of the battery depends on what you are doing on the device, but in general it lasts almost all day. This iPhone buys it to change my iPhone 7. The health of the battery of this device is deteriorated much, in less than an hour I ran out of battery. The microphone could not serve, I could not make calls, except connecting bluetooth hearing aids. Besides, the iPhone 7 is no longer compatible with iOS 16. By the way, my iPhone 7 is also Recondicated and I hard enough. It was a good purchase, I am satisfied with the iPhone 11 Pro..."
"This opinion I am doing after using the iPhone for 1 year. When I bought it I had use damage, nothing out of the ordinary, I loved it, I recommended it quite. WITHOUT EMBARGO, when I sold it I had 93% battery of life and now it only has 77%...."
"The product is semi-new but in relatively good condition as it is seen scratches in the corners, the charger is not original and comes inside any box. It came with a 79% battery life"
"Well, the team feels good at hand and very practical to use."
"I had never bought a reconditioning cell phone and was very afraid of what was coming to me. My cell phone came as new, I only had a small scrape in the part where it was charged but outside of that, it was intact. The battery was 90% and I have been using it for 9 months without any problem. I do not advise to buy the insurance as I did because I really do not use it, they never send you very well the policy and I am not very clear from where I have to go in case something happens to it. For the time I have right now with the cell phone I plan to change it in a few months and I never used the safe bliss. Already thinking about it, I think that if you do not have an iPhone card in the iPhone for life mode that I think it is worth the decent amount a month, buying a conditioned Rea is a very good alternative. You can buy a little more premium equipment at a super price. 100% recommended!!"
"Everything excellent just the screen has a light rayon"
"I bought it, I arrived in good condition. They changed the back of the iPhone and there is no problem with that. The only detail that it has after more than a month of use is that the microphone does not sound very loud from the first day I received it, when I talk to another person they have to raise the volume to the maximum to listen to me. The cell phone outside of that I arrive with a 99% battery life, looks good and has no other fault so I decided to keep it despite the detail of the microphone. If I would recommend it it is understood that it is reconditioned and by price it is a good option (I bought it on primeday at approximately 480dls)."
"The good thing: It arrived in one day, it includes charger and usb cable normal to lightning (which I liked more since it became more practical than usbc-lightning). Estetically it would put a 9.8 it has a slight imperceptible ray basically in the area of cameras (not in the lenses) and the frames are steel are stained with sweat and with fingerprints but they are removed with a lymphed, not if it is normal. In the perfect operation. In the camera also. It was put a mica of tempered glass, which is greatly appreciated. The contras: I feel that the front horn duena distorted and when it is at high volume pulls out air what makes me think that it is no longer resistant to water already wue by there could enter. The battery is at 81% of its original capacity so if I feel a shorter duration than I expected. Considering that it is a reconditioned and that I buy it in a low orecio in the hot comes out the truth is that I am very satisfied with the purchase."
"The phone comes in very good aesthetic conditions, there are no scratches on the aesthetic part, the battery 82% to the reason of what is indicated in the publication the only detail was with the speaker from the top that arrived defective but from there on out everything correctly"
"It’s the first time I’ve bought something Reaccomandised, I’ve been using it for 8 days and I generally consider it a good purchase. The equipment arrived well packaged, it’s not the original box (as you’ll see in the images) but it fulfills its function to protect it, the cell phone has minimal details on the sides, as normal use when you don’t place a newly purchased housing, the screen has details but it’s not almost imperceptible and it doesn’t feel to touch it, for me there’s no problem about it. I repeat, I’ve been using the cell phone for 8 days and so far it works as new, the only detail is that the maximum capacity of the battery is 87%, even though it’s not so bad for me. The only reasons why I don’t give you 5 stars is because the current adapter (the quadrito) doesn’t work well, as they mention in the description both the adapter and the USB cable (charger) are not original and the adapter feels and it doesn’t look very bad for me."
"Excellent product for the price that is published, I asked it with fear that it would turn out defective, I have 2 weeks with it and it has worked perfect. It has minimal details on the back of the camera that are only seen if you approach in detail. The battery came to 84% so I do not put the 5 stars. Outside it. It seems to me an excellent product. It comes in generic cardboard box with charger and generic cable that works well. In conclusion, it meets expectations."
"It has aesthetics of 10 and the battery has a capacity of 85%"
"I got here without the iPhone box, I got here early and it worked well."
"The description and even in the box specifications said it came with above 90% battery condition which did not meet, and it came with 85%. 5% is quite on a cell phone of this brand."
"Super quality price ratio."
"The truth is that the product arrived a day after the expected but arrived well packaged, it included a bucket and cable (not seen of very good quality) but it is appreciated that it brings, the device arrived with 83% in battery but that depends on each iPhone, the edges are very well cared like the back and cameras, in front I arrive with crystal mica ( it has two light scratches on the screen ) but nothing that really affects. You pay for a product “used” but of good condition"
"Buy fair, however you have to be lucky for a team with a good percentage of battery to arrive, that if 80% does not go down. To me I get a percentage of 83%, the truth has minimal details, you must pay a lot of attention to realize them."
"The battery's capacity at 87% I did not like, otherwise, impeccable phone and works perfect."
"The cell is flawless, looks new, the only detail is that the charger cable comes hard a couple of months and I had to buy it new."
"It is an excellent opportunity, however microphone and horn are damaged, I would have liked to have mentioned that in the description, everything else works perfect, it is very normal in iphones that detail. I highly recommend, I would certainly buy again."
"Hello, the product arrived in perfect condition, but with a battery to 84%, everything else to 100"
"The phone arrived in very good condition, and I thought it was an excellent price."
"The battery arrived with a little more than 85% life and the phone looks in good condition without blows, the only thing I didn't like was that it had some slight stains on the back, you are only visible if you thoroughly inspect the phone."
"I grabbed a super promo in hotsale, everything was fine when it came to me until I heard the horn of the calls and it sounded blown, I was going to return it until I took it to apple and it was just cleaning they checked it out and they evaluated it 10 out of 10 and battery to 100% so far all ok, the net scratch me"
"A good option to acquire an iPhone without paying so much"
"It came sooner than expected. At the moment very well, I did not notice any scratches on the screen or on the body of the computer, it seems literally new! And besides that the battery capacity is at 99% so no complaint, I will make a update if anything changes or notice any inconvenience, so far everything perfect. UPDATE November 1, 2022 After 5 months of use the maximum battery capacity has been drastically reduced by 10% from being 99% now it seems to me that it has declined exponentially even though I take great care of the charging cycles of the phone, this is no longer enchanting me as at the beginning."
"Well for the price I think they can offer a better product, as soon as I received it today but the details are noticeable plus a rayon on the screen that is very visible to daylight and in the light of the screen, I will try it a week because I arrive with 88% battery then I will see if it is worth the aesthetics"
"The truth is I hesitated to buy a reconditioned phone, but it went well, it's like new and with 95 battery that is the one that I was worried about, I recommend it to you right now without any details..."
"excellent product, only light detail scratch on screen but at the same time 10/10. The battery arrived at 85%, Face id working perfectly. Overall the team has not given me any problems, easy the battery lasts the entire day with moderate use, times of charge according and do not have any over heating. With a cover that protects the team completely it is perfect, I highly recommend the product and the seller."
"The product aesthetically looks good, it came with a screen protector that cleverly covered a rayon at the top of the screen, but the big problem is the speakers, either they are blown up or they simply hear bad and little, I have a month with it and I thought it would not affect that situation, but every one I put a call on speaker is simply heard very low and with noise and although it says that one can return within 90 days to request a change or return, no option is shown to make it"
"I share my product experience. It came to me with the screen intact without any noticeable scratches like the back, however the frames at the top and bottom had two bolones that I suppose are marks of some fall. The condition of the stack was at 81%, that I did not like so much the truth since my current iPhone 4 years from having it consists of 78% and it is not great difference. I came with the charger (pretty generic) and the data cable, lacked the tool to pull out the Sim card. At the time of wanting to transfer my data at the end showed me a message of “Can’t find Iphone” and had to erase everything and start again. For those details I decided to return it and start the refund process."
"There is a very small detail that only looks very close and with a screen guard you no longer see"
"Great purchase, I hesitated on quality and battery status and arrived with 99% but is practically new. Recommended 100%"
"Resist anything, I've dropped my iPhone many times and it's still flawless."
"In itself, it is a very good cell phone, the color is very nice a size that makes it comfortable to bring in the hand, and for the price they make you have a relatively new phone with the difference when buying it from a stranger, that you have a company that supports with limited warranty, but a guarantee; the details are that they promised a minimum of 90% in battery condition and arrived with 88%, came the screen with superficial scratches, not deep but if visible which do not affect the functioning of the phone only aesthetic, and also did not bring the tool of extraction of the SIM card, detail apparently not important, but if you do not have another, you are looking for pins or clips whenever you need to remove the card."
"So far quite surprised, I take a little while to arrive but it seems new, comes with drums to 98%, the aesthetic of 10. I will continue to use it, if it stays like this I will change to 5 stars."
"The Media Could Not Be Loaded. I have almost a month with the phone, I had not written my experience because I wanted to check that everything worked and for now everything is perfect. The only detail I found upon receiving it was that the box I arrived in was semi-open; instead, the box that came inside with the phone was in perfect condition. I arrive with the accessories described in the publication, charger and generic cable running. I arrive without protective mica and with super minimal details on the screen, relatively imperceptible. The battery at 100% of its capacity. Buttons, sensors and camera working perfectly. If during the warranty time something happened, I will edit my review. For now I recommend the product."

"The phone came with a few little scratches on the screen but they only noticed with the screen turned off and at certain angles with the light. When I put the glass screen protector on it, it’s like they disappeared, they don’t notice at all. The battery life came at 95%, which is not so bad considering that they only guarantee you 90%. The charger with which they deliver it is generic and not fast charging, but it works perfect and looks good quality. Outside of that, the phone is perfect, I have not had any problems, it works wonderfully and for the price, it is very worth it, yes I recommend it"
"The battery, the sides a little worn out"
"I had already purchased Reconditioned products so I decided to buy the iPhone 11 Pro, It has some details like scratches on the screen but they are light that does not affect its functioning, also in the back it seems that it has spots or scratches but equally it does not look at the naked eye and with a cover it does not see, the truth has few bad things, the good price for what I received, battery at 92%, aesthetic of 9, the truth is good purchase, besides it has guarantee by Amazon in case a failure occurs, or a month more by the supplier directly. If something happens to the cell phone for some malfunction I will update my comment."
"I arrived in good condition, in terms of aesthetics everything super well only that on the screen came some very minimal scratches does not affect anything I can say that this 9.8 of aesthetics. the battery reached 89% arrived in 3 days to Mexico. Price $10,199 is small 5.8 inches I imagined it would be bigger. It is my first time using IPhone and I can say that I recommend it widely. I hope not to apply the guarantee and that it continues to work at 100% already take a month and has not presented me any fault."
"Good buy, the phone aesthetically 10, the horn somewhat damaged but for the price I do not complain, in 3 months everything else works Perfect"
"The equipment comes well, it has very slight aesthetic details that with the cover are not perceived, it only came with a generic charger and the battery came to a capacity of 85%, it lasts a day and a half approx. The truth is that I was very afraid for the bad comments, but I touch good luck, I think I would buy it again; I hope help them my comment."
"Good quality relationship price. The article, although Renew, arrived in very good conditions both aesthetic, and functional. The battery with a health status greater than 90%. At the moment with telcel and At&t works without problem. The only one against which does not have compatibility for functional with the phone band 28, so if you are a high-quality user or some OMV (Pillophone, Newww, Bait, etc.) that works with the high-quality networks, you will not be able to use it."
"13/10/22 : certainly a tempting offer at first glance, a price accessible by such a high-end phone. What did it cost? your luck, the phone can be a 10/10, impeccable, without details. Or, it can also be a 1/10, deteriorated, beaten, scraped and worn. Regretable the second was my case, all the buttons carved and the phone constantly at high temperature, the condition of the battery at 77% marking “maintenance”. I do not doubt that good phones can come out of this attractive offer, but it was not my case. I am in the process of returning. My recommendation? Find the original, new and guaranteed; in my case, I decided to purchase the iPhone 13 mini on the official page. Greetings."
"Good product only that in calls you hear very distorted and severe voice. And it also heats sometimes, without much use."
"I arrived with scratches on the screen quite visible but very few and on the shore so they do not really affect with a mica go unnoticed, I expected it to reach me with a 90 battery but I arrived with an 82 nevertheless not down from there for a month from there outside seems new satisfied with my purchase."
"The horn sounds bad, I understand it's ""renewed"" but then it doesn't meet its revision and renewal standard either."
"This good product I only have doubt with the charge of the battery since I think it lasts little maybe the battery is not 80% as described"
"Excellent team, the only thing that looks bad is that the stack marks me at 86% capacity, but it doesn't affect that it affects its performance."
"It comes well packed. The equipment that came to me has light scratches on the frames, with a cover being removed. The screen also has scratches, none deep, comes with a mica and become imperceptible. Cameras, screen, sensors, speakers and buttons in good condition, comes with charger and generic cable. Battery to 85% of life. The only thing I did not like was that it does not support the band 28 then it is not compatible with Altan."
"I have 3 months with the team and it works very well, of aesthetics only had a rayon on one side but the rest as if it were new."
"The phone arrived just as soon as I had been told, however, when I opened the product there was no paper that said it was certified or something like that, only the equipment (with a thin protection and wrapped in paper) and the charging cable with the adapter.I didn't get the hook to pull out the sim.Internally the phone arrived well, nothing was locked and with 83% battery (waiting more but the announcement was clear).However, the screen was quite scratched from the sides and was quite noticeable to an arm of distance.Generally well, but for the price paid (12,800 mxn) I expected an intact screen."
"In 100 functionality. Aesthetic if it leaves much to be desired. But anyway, we knew that."
"The equipment comes in very good condition, with the exception of the charger current remover, because, overheats the equipment and as you use it gets too hot. Changing it for an original remover the phone stopped overheating. The battery status came with a 98% charge retention and as time went by (A couple of months) it was reduced to 88%. Normal thing considering that it is a reconditioned computer and was off for too long, eventually dropped the actual battery retention."
"The product is understood to be reconditioned, it only brings a small detail in the glass of the screen a rayon but very small as it did not have protective mica, the stack has a life of 97% works very well and for the price I pay I am satisfied as it feels the quality of the products apple I have also had high ranges of android to tell the truth have always lasted longer the iphones, that is why this time I wanted to return to this brand, I know that many people distrust of the reconditioned at least here in Amazon I have obtained good products, it gives me a lot of confidence to buy here"
"Like many, I had doubts when making the purchase of a product that is not completely new, reading reviews of scams or bad products leaves you much to want; I decided to do it to test Amazon's experience with reconditioned products and surprised me the answer.The product arrived much earlier than expected, the package contains everything according to the specifications of the seller as it appears in the description, with aesthetics of 9 almost as new (small scratches of use on the edges ) but we are aware that it is not a new product, the condition of the battery is 90% quite decent for a product that is not new. Overall everything works to perfection until the moment; before the end of the guarantee of Amazon I will return to report as continuous the functioning of the equipment after time.Good relation price benefit."
"because I had never bought a refurbished product and some users said it was a risk . and at least in my case this product came out very good , no faults and nothing almost no aesthetic details , I am happy with this product"
"The cell phone was really new because it had 100% in battery capacity status but I didn't like that they sent it with glass protector already set so that I didn't see that it had a tremendous rayon on screen and I realized 2 weeks after I was curious because with glass already put, that disappointed me I saw other aesthetic details that I thought it was okay for something was cheap no matter I knew it was with details because this specified that it's not new from factory but the fact of hiding a rayon didn't seem to me, everything else excellent"
"He arrived in time and form, had many doubts regarding the purchase, the only but that would put him is the battery with a maximum of 82% charge, out of that everything perfect with the product, I was satisfied"
"Update: I decided to return it because after 1 month of use, under 2% the condition of the battery and it was heated a lot with the data turned on. If you are not demanding it is a very good option .... Until now it has worked well, I arrive with 89% of battery, it has light scratches on the screen but they are practically imperceptible. I have noticed that the back of the camera gets very hot under the camera when I use mobile data for a long time, if I use the camera for a long time and sometimes when it is charging. Aesthetic 9.5/10.I will make an update later on this heating, if I do not convince I will validate the guarantee!!!"
"The product came to me very well and before the time indicated. If I want to mention that at first I was about to return the cell phone because it brings some details of scratches on the screen, nothing serious. But if I would like Amazon to have a better evaluation standard on its products, even though one knows beforehand that the product is used, but still the price is considerable. Generally the cell phone has worked very well. The battery came to me with 94% and the cellular performance is very good. The solution I gave to the details was to buy a glass screen protector and looks like new! Thank you Amazon!"
"Very good product! In excellent condition! The only thing that was not made me of good quality was the charger with which it comes. But from there everything super good"
"The cell phone arrived in excellent condition, it came in a very cool box, at first I thought it had some scratches but it was like glue, after cleaning it was very good, I could say that I give it a 10 of aesthetics since it does not really bring any punch or scratch, the battery arrived at 93% I think that the same is very good, besides the price in which I bought it was very good since it was offered by the hot comes out and now I have seen that it went up a lot, I am very satisfied with the purchase"
"The equipment comes without apparent details, the back cover and edges without details, it looks perfect!It came with a glass screen that still makes it look great, however I saw comments that used them to hide scratches, and in fact, when removing it the screen had multiple small scratches and some more marked.With mica they do not look so I have no problems.As for the performance, the percentage of life of the battery is 98 % quite well!Satisfy with the purchase, if there is any change I will modify this review."
"The product I like, arrived in good condition, slight aesthetic details that are noticed only if you look very in detail, pile to 86%. Everything works excellently. I like and the price is good"
"the phone changed too many pieces for my opinion the battery changed the screen and the camera was very badly installed when I open the camera it gets locked too much and when I move the cell phone with the camera it moves very tightly and when I take a photo it locks even more and when I change the photo mode it locks even more the truth everything of the camera is horrible for the money that cost and the type of phone that it is, also the touch sometimes does not detect the truth well only those pieces get to know that they were changed but I don't know if they open it changed more things"
"The phone arrived in a plastic box, the charger is obviously generic (if it were original it would certainly carry a 10 rating) 512gb storage, arrived with a 92% battery, minimum usage marks. The very nice equipment. The bad thing was that I asked for it in green midnight and arrived in gold color. For the price I recommend it and also for fluidity, for the 2022 it does not ask anything to the current Android models of half range that round in similar prices. Undoubtedly a good purchase. Greetings from the CDMX I hope to serve my opinion. If you can buy the iPhone 11pro max I recommend it more since it brings battery and screen bigger than the 11pro."
"It came to me without scratches, like new battery to 85% the only bad thing is that when I start to charge it gets very hot.It's fast, it lasts a lot of battery and the camera is great to change my 6s for this one and the truth if it won't heat it would give you 5 stars."
"The iPhone arrived in excellent aesthetic condition of 9.7 only has a few small points on the back cover that are only distinguished against light (they have to be seen done with the cover) works wonderfully, the battery reached 93% and 4 months later I already have it at 85% but it still works well in optimization.I highly recommend it, I got it at 6 MSI and the cost was 14500 the 11 pro of 256gbVery agree with the purchase."
"I decided to return the phone because it had serious scratches, especially on the screen where they try to hide them with a glass mica."
"The article came in very good condition only a few scratches on screen but in general the only thing and I think for me is the bad thing that the percentage of battery reached me with 81% the bad thing that soon I will have to change it."
"Aesthetic 8/10, some screen scratches and camera frame, nothing that is noticed too much or that affects the operation, with a case is not noticed at all."
"After a few months the horn and facial recognition began to fail; besides that the aesthetics are very good"
"Disappointing: The horn sounds plastic, low and strange, the screen does not know if it is my perception but gives not so faithful tones and the mobile signal you have to alternate the plane mode so that you want to obey. On the other hand scratches and battery to 87% that it was something to which I was previously aware but for the above I was disappointed; the product could be quite good in relation to price but those aspects are key, neither I wanted to risk it to a drop of water or fall after seeing those details . Pending reimbursement, I will see if I can review the article differently"
"I have been 3 weeks and to this day super good, aesthetic 9.8 but practically as new, only detail to consider battery in 87% of its capacity. Suddenly calls take a while to come out, but I want to think it is my phone company. It really surprised by the great product that I received, certainly highly recommended. I hope everything continues as until today."
"The device came with a very good aesthetic, some scratches on the screen but they are only noticeable against light, the bad thing is that I get with 86% battery and sometimes I feel that it lasts very little, maybe it validates the guarantee if it is so I edit the review with that experience."
"the product came to me with scratches in the part of the speakers and the front camera, I've been trying to update the cell phone for 30 minutes and it just says ""preparing update"""
"The phone on the outside is in impeccable condition but inside the battery is 80% and the speakers don't listen well I have to return it"
"The product was incredible, it had no scratches of consideration, the aesthetic of 10. The problem was the battery, came with 75% the description of the product indicated that it arrived with 80 or more."
"The phone is fine, only the battery was given to me with 74% and I had to go replace it directly to Apple."
"I have used it 5 months so far, on two occasions the cells of the battery have been decalibrated (it is arranged by totally downloading the equipment and recharging it) and because outside of that it works very well and aesthetically is like new"
"The iphone 11 pro acquired arrived without setbacks.As for the aesthetics of the apparatus has an 8/10, it does not have scratches or blows. The steel bezel is not well placed and a separation is obstructed in the top left and even it is considered to be particles of dust. It brings a glass mica on the screen and the cable and charger complements are generic as indicated by amazon renewedAs regards the functionality of the phone:1. The phone does not come with an original or genuine battery of apple and is the first thing that tells you the phone, once you turn it on and start the initial configuration. Given the condition of the battery it is not possible to verify the porch that promises amazon renewed from at least 80%. With the first day of use the phone is heated and the battery gets downloaded quickly. The blue phone is turned off suddenly.2. The iphone 11 pro, comes with a software version 14."
"The only thing that didn't seem to me is that they opened it and switched the screen to a generic one, plus the module of the cameras had screws inside, but since I'm here, I'm fine."
"Incredible I have been with the team for 3 months and it has not had a failure, the pile reached me with 99% and without any scratch. If any doubt I recommend it."
"The fact that it is reconditioned does not mean that it is a defective, maltreated or dysfunctional product for nothing is the third time that I acquire items reconditioned at a better price and I have really been satisfied so far, the phone arrived in very good condition in a very father acrylic case and without any defects, takes some luxury photographs, I still need to discover other functions but even right now it is recommended."
"Very good aesthetics and functioning seems new ottoi satisfied"
"It came very well in aesthetics but when I checked the battery it was below 80% that's what's promised, so I brought it back."
"I received an article with aesthetics to 100, I was not able to find any details, even arrived with a protective mica installed on the screen, zero scratches or blows.As for the battery, it reached 94% and I have not had a single problem, load without problem and lasts almost the whole day without having to recharge.It came with generic accessories the medium quality cable (I don't know if it comes certified, I don't use it, I use an original from Apple) and the charger of very bad quality, came packed in very simple box and the equipment well protected with bubble plastic.The equipment comes released and immediately grabbed signal from AT&T and Telcel.The serial number starts with F and according to the information that one finds on the Internet this means that it was rebuilt by Apple or an Apple certified company to carry out reconstruction processes.I paid $16,300 Mexican pesos for this equipment (less than half of what it costs new) and I am satisfied at 100%, I recommend the seller and the team.I bought the equipment a Monday afternoon and received it Wednesday before half of that week."
"I stopped working the touch a week ago, as I can run the warranty I can't find a link"
"Excellent product meets expectations very well maintained aesthetically good functionality I do not give the 5 stars since I said I had to arrive with 90% battery and received it with 84%"
"Very satisfied and surprised with the purchase... until I took off the mica with which I was coming... since it has the screen with 2 important scratches on the screen, which were not noticed by the glass that I was carrying.I received it very quickly, just the next day of the purchase.It has 1 rayon in a corner, no scandal and a few small holes in the cameras.But nothing significant...except that, the phone could pass me flawless came with 88% of battery.That were things that I had budgeted for."
"The device arrived in perfect condition, it does not count with any stroke or lightning on the screen nor in the back, I obtained a device with 100% battery and aesthetically well, now it is time to use it and see how it goes in the day to day I am satisfied with the purchase"
"Very good option! It is almost like newVery careful and is a good way to take care of the planet by reusing. For now it has worked perfectly."
"I arrived in excellent condition, 97% battery, capacity 256 gb and advertising was very sincere when indicating that it is sideways or reconstructed. In my case I arrived with light scratches on the screen but nothing that affects or is very visible. In everything else it was excellently careful, literal seemed new.I was sent it with a screen protector already put and up to now has responded as a new one in terms of its resistance to water.I am totally satisfied with my purchase, I save $$$ when buying it like this and the phone was practically new.In the personal I am very happy after this year of use and dare to say an extremely excessive use, it is my main tool of the day and despite that I have not had a single problem with this phone."
"Very good aesthetic conditions, if you don't mind that it doesn't come in its original box this is an excellent choice!"
"It arrived in the indicated time, practically intact, aesthetic of 9.7 out of 10, brings a couple of brands in the frame, but nothing really important, the battery arrived with 79%, yet I decided to keep it. I highly recommend it, price-quality ratio, excellent!!!"
"The team itself, has aesthetics of 10, has no scratches and is very elegant to the eye. It came to me with 83% condition, but I feel it gets very hot. In addition, the speaker at the top feels low volume. For everything else it is a good team."
"Meet what they offer, meet my expectations"
"I'm very happy and satisfied with my 11 pro iphone, it has a number of utilities that I didn't count on them"
"I brought it back because it came with very little battery."
"I saw many reviews a bit 50/50, but I wanted to wait 1 month using the cell phone to give review. I think it is lucky the cell phone that touches you. To me it went very well in terms of aesthetics and use: 10/10. But on drums it was a little normal, it arrived me with condition of 82%, still it lasts a whole day. The truth I would if I would buy another conditioning again."
"The iPhone arrived in good condition, aesthetic of 10, battery at 100% but when we put it on chip and carried out tests we realized that almost the horn of the earphone was not heard, we had to return it, the return was made without any problem and we acquired it with another seller, this new equipment arrived with 85% of battery but until now working correctly."
"The phone says the maximum capacity is 100% so I think it's okay in that way but it came from the super scratched front camera and from the back right on the block it's kind of detached and very dusty on the front microphone, I'm not convinced by that."
"It arrived in perfect condition, battery to 98% the only bad thing is that it gets too hot but for the price is super good, I would recommend it."
"I was afraid to buy this product but at the time of arrival I received it in perfect condition, with 89% battery and without any visible brand, the only thing that I did not like were the accessories with which they came, the cube did not work and the cable was bent, but well it was to be expected, outside of that excellent product.In 2 months I confirm my experience."
"It works well, aesthetics well."
"He asks nothing of a new one, I arrive impeccable"
"Everything is fine and the battery is 100, but a month and a half of use is failing me I don't know if the battery or charging center, alone stops charging I have to connect and disconnect to get hold of"
"Like many other people doubt if buying a Reconditioning was a good option. The truth is that I am more than satisfied with the product, the phone is practically new, as soon as aesthetics I could only find a minimal detail and it should be said that I am very special with those details but it has absolutely nothing wrong, neither a scratch to the screen nor any hidden vice after a month of continuous use which I wait to review. The battery came to me with 98% and it has kept like this, so technically I received a new phone at an excellent price.Seller: Achemex"
"The team is in good condition, only I didn't convince the life of the battery that came to 87% and one of the horn is heard distorted. That's why I give it 3 stars."
"I had my doubts as it was a re-conditioning product, encouraged me by the 90-day warranty. iPhone arrived the next day and in perfect aesthetic conditions. Battery to 86%. It has been 3 days and it works perfect, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
"Excellent product, the only problem is that I got scratched from the screen, too well"
"I have just received the equipment and the truth I like but I am disappointed that they do not comply with what they describe, it reached me with 78% battery and without key to take out the sim, we will see how it works, I will be modifying this comment in the future.Ojo: if you buy this product or any other restored equipment, check it well and that they comply 100% with what they describe."
"I'm doing fine. It's only got stains on the back, but I guess it's because of the use of aesthetics. I'll give you a 8.5."
"The product in question of aesthetics came very well, no scratches or blows; however it does not meet the condition of battery. It brought a compliance sheet up to 90, but the phone arrived with 88% so it is the only thing that it did not comply with."
"I liked the price to be 256gb.The health of the battery was at 90%Come with a glass mica included, I do not like to have the mobile with glass mica and I took it off, I realized that the screen had too many scratches, many small ones that only look with light and others very marked."
"To tell you the truth the iPhone came in an excellent condition, came super careful and only with some and very light scratches, the battery surprised me very much as it comes with 87%, everything works amazing speakers, sensors etc etc, the charger is a generic that yes but in my case I arrived in an excellent condition!!!"
"I've been on the phone for a week now, it's the first of the brand I use, I couldn't find a single detail more than the battery that came to 91% (which makes me very good for the price you pay) the phone is practically new and for the great price reduction it receives I dare say it's almost worth buying."
"It is an excellent option the phone is certified by Amazon and Apple, it brought 100% battery and without any aesthetic details or in the operation of the phone"
"I get scratches in the corners and the screen but nothing that affects the battery comes to me with a 90 and with 5 charges this in 88 but I hope it was for the updates"
"So far very well I recommend it came to me aesthetically impeccable and 92 battery"
"The box where it comes from is not the best, he phone comes with some scratches how it is specified but it works well, acceptable."
"Well, only the price I was told it was 11 and fraction and in the end it was up 13 and yet I decided to buy it bad mouth taste but it was fine."
"To have bought it at $9.999 mxn I thought it would come with something notorious, but it came super well, it took 1 month and it has not failed at all, I was afraid at first to be Rea conditioned but it was totally worth it!! It came with 83% battery but it performs very, very well!"
"The truth was that I was afraid to buy these types of reconditioned items and as I saw in many videos, this is random. Something good or something not so good can come in but the guarantee backs it up. Mine fortunately arrived intact except for the screen a bit scratched but nothing seriousThe battery condition at 98% and it has worked perfectly for me in these weeks."
"Aesthetically it deserves a 10, I liked it very much was very easy to configure, the battery came with 93% capacity of use, the only thing that started to attract my attention was the screen, (I was aware as a product “Renewed” could have details) the screen was replaced but its quality was very low for my view was a bit difficult and tired, I really liked buying the shipping time, I will try again to buy a renewal but hopefully no longer come with this detail. Before I take the serial number for when the new one arrives I do not have problems"
"The system when handling it works normal, however the ignition button is a little loose, the cell phone frame looks like a material that is foreign to that of the iPhone (it looks and feels very ordinary).The battery is low, although in all the reviews it is mentioned that they arrive of 95%.On the screen there is a stain that is not removable (you can see in the battery photo, it is to the right of the last word “use it”)The accessories look very bad quality too."
"The Media Could Not Be Loaded. The truth is that the product came much better than I expected, according to the specifications that indicate you of a refurbished product. For example, it came to me with a 95% battery, which is very well, I have been using it for approximately 3 weeks and has not presented me with any problem. If I arrive with some slight aesthetic details, but clearly in the description it says that it can come with them, besides they will not be perceived to an arm of distance, which in ml case was true, I add a glass mica and no longer notice the rayon. So if, from my perspective all well, and according to its description. Pd. It is also very nice"

So if, from my perspective everything well, and according to his description. Pd. It is also very nice"
"I had my doubts but to my surprise the phone arrived with 100% condition on the battery. Aesthetically very careful and all works perfectly. It gives the impression of being a completely new phone."
"The color and physical state of the cell phone is excellent, however the battery life is not as expected."
"The equipment that came to me was of quality, no delay bolts and the condition of the battery reached above 90% aesthetically this very well, the charging input works well and all the buttons are perfect, speakers and cameras work well, it connects well to the wifi and telephone signal."
"I arrived in excellent condition and battery life by 84%"
"The phone seems to work well, I have my doubts about the use in data mode. Physically it seemed fine until I removed the mica, had the screen badly mistreated (with the mica it can not be seen) even the ras of the front camera has light scratches, the battery tested in 83% in my experience I would not buy renewed mobiles again"
"The phone reached me very quickly, it has no rayon visible to the naked eye, the condition of the battery is at 85%. Very good purchase"
"A good purchase for the price, it is clear that it is a refurbished product. So far it has turned out very well and is in good condition."
"I come from iPhone X and this is as described, it comes with a legend in the stack that could be lower, but it comes at 100%, being a refurbished product is quite good. It had no scratches or anything unusual. I highly recommend it"
"It came with very minimal aesthetic details, it does not affect its use. For the price it has is super good. It arrived on time, the performance of the battery is excellent, already I have almost two months with it."
"All excellent, I've been with the 1 month, the stack, the system all right, I'm early."
"Very good team arrived in perfect condition and the equipment is like new, and with 88% battery percentage, at first I was afraid and doubted about buying refurbished but really worth it. I think I would buy it again"
"Like everyone had my doubts but it was worth it, the team arrived very well works perfect battery health to 93% and in terms of aesthetics has not even a scratch. I certainly recommend it."
"Until now I can not qualify the durability because it has just arrived me (conditional area), but it reached me in excellent conditions, if it was not for the battery that has condition (85) could pass as product “new”. It arrived without any scratches, perfect aesthetic conditions and for what I paid for I am very happy."
"I am very pleased with my product. I arrived in excellent condition"
"I loved the cell phone in general, it doesn't have scratches or scratches, I arrived with 84% battery, which is acceptable to be reconditioned, the cell phone works excellent, as new, the cameras also, the only detail is that it has a bit off the screen at the top, but nothing that can really affect the cell phone, came wrapped in bubbles and with a generic charger."
"It came before, had no rayon and it works perfectly. The battery is almost 100% and it brought original cable. I think I was lucky because it looks new  already I have two weeks with it and without problems"
"All right and with the description however the horn is not heard at all well, it is burst"
"So far I've been testing it for a week and all right, from aesthetics to software, that's generic in charger and I didn't have originals."
"At first I had doubts about the phone because I had seen in several posts that sometimes arrived failed, with the battery very worn out or blows. But in my case I was lucky, the phone came to me with 98% battery and with two small scratches on the screen that did not affect the performance of the product. The package came as indicated in the description, a generic box and a charger of doubtful quality, but it works. The first thing I did after setting it up was to check it with the 3utools program to know if any piece had been changed but no, everything was like new and I feel very comfortable with my purchase and I want to remind them something that I read a lot “It’s a volado” might be to touch you an almost new team like mine or touch you one with more time of use and/or imperfections."
"The truth is everything from the price paid to the quality of the equipment, I arrived in perfect condition. I have already been in use for a few months and everything goes well"
"The battery came to me with an 84% service life. Aesthetically and in operation it would give you a 10 out of 10. They send it with a certified cable and a certified charger even if they are not both original. I am one of those who keep the box. But these do not come with an original box but generic. That said I am very happy with my purchase."
"Aesthetics of 9.5, battery at 96%, brings a front glass mica installed, currently works without any inconvenience, fast shipping. I will update if I have any faults. At the moment the best quality and price ratio."
"It meets all expectations, I had my doubts but the truth I recommend"
"It arrived earlier than planned, in perfect condition and without aesthetic details. It also comes with a glass mica included."
"What I like: I've been using it for a while and so far the operation is super optimal. The battery has good performance compared to another new one I have. What I didn't like: About the screen comes out a little bit, but it is imperceptible in use, another detail is that in the phone information indicates that the battery is not an original Product."
"Very nice and everything but I get 89% stack when the application clearly says more than 90"
"The phone looks new, very comfortable with my purchase"
"I just got the iphone. Aesthetically okay, the problem was that when I get into configuration to see the battery status I get the error message that the piece is not original, is poorly installed or does not work well. The same thing with the screen. I see that other buyers do get the battery percentage, so I don’t want to risk it and use it that way without the quality standards they had promised when buying it. Since it doesn’t meet the standards promised by the seller, I’m starting the return, it’s a shame because I really wanted this cell phone."
"The phone came with an aesthetic of 9, for the price was a very good purchase"
"I encouraged myself to buy it after watching several renewed Amazon videos and the truth I am very happy on my first day, everything works aesthetics is impeccable and the battery percentage comes up 90, accessories are no problem because it specifies that they are not original but they work perfectly, it would be a thing to see how it continues to work in 1 week 1 month etc."
"The team has 9.5 aesthetics, only that the team that has touched me brought the battery of 80% which was already a problem of use for what it was dealing with, just as it had about heating when performing some activity (specific games)"
"I was really surprised!! :D The phone came with 91% in the condition of the battery and with a mica already installed, it doesn't have a single scratch, not a single hit. It works all perfect, so far nothing has failed, it doesn't heat up or anything. It only has 2 light ""scraps"" on the edges, which I only reached to see with the Flash of my other iPhone, at first glance it is completely perfect! I'm almost completely sure I am first owner of this iPhone!! I highly recommend the seller BuySpry for delivering products in PERFECT status! I will definitely buy you again!! :D:D"
"Actually I was afraid about how the product was going to arrive as the price seemed quite attractive to me, I have to say that I am completely surprised as the team arrived without a single scratch, completely aesthetic at 100%, the box if it was generic and the charger also but completely functional and emails give to what paid by the team, I definitely recommend it"
"I arrive on time at the established date, the detail is that the screen if they come something damaged, but in operation perfectly the battery equals 85% but is Recondicated can not one demand much equal for the price."
"Although it arrived with little stack, it went to my closest apple to apply the insurance. I did not charge anything and now I have a 11 pro new! It is a matter of luck but for 11,099.00 not bad. I think it is a great option is as long as it is not very necessary and urgent the phone, since otherwise you like it you can return it. In my case I bought it for a quota of 999.00 that gives me Amazon"
"The iPhone only reached 80% of the battery and it warmed up a lot when recording or taking photos, it was downloaded very quickly I guess it didn't touch good luck."
"The truth the phone has been working very well, I am about to fulfill 3 months with it. I arrive with 100% battery condition, but so far it has gone down to 94% I have not had Iphone before if I do not know very well how worrying it could be. Details on the sides of use, but screen and back to 10000% The only detail, that has had is that the charger stopped working at two months. So consider buying one of the brand. From there on out, it did not come with box or original charger, nor mica as many said, but that last is the least."
"The equipment came without any damage, I could only say that the detail I found was that the battery is 82% I understand that they mention that it is minimum 80%, but in functionality it is 100, I would buy again without problem”."
"Arrived in the right time, has no details, very good purchase"
"I arrived in excellent condition, more than I expected."
"The phone arrived with a few small scratches on the screen that are almost imperceptible to the eye, acceptable to be a reconditioning equipment, that is, it has no impact on the housing and arrived with a performance of 90% of battery, which lasts long enough, I agree with the purchase, I recommend it."
"Buy Renovated Premium from Amazon USA, works with Telcel chip, came to me with 100% battery range, excellent choice."
"Very bad performance, pesima investment for the result..."
"I've been with the cell phone for a month and the truth if I'm surprised at the operation since I haven't battled with it, the packaging is generic but it's very good, aesthetic details 9.8/10, until right now everything goes well, I hope to continue like this, battery of 94%"
"Phone arrived in excellent condition, good value for money, came with charger and cable (generic, not original) , which is appreciated. Good purchase."
"I didn't like the state of the battery, I got a team with 87 batteries, I used it for a week but the team got warmed up and the speaker was broken, I compared it to another iphone 11 and it worked great compared to this one, maybe I just had bad luck because in the beginning I had heard good reviews of the equipment and so I encouraged myself to buy it, but as I repeat I had bad luck with this cell phone. I also had a chip in the frame of the camera, I didn't really care much but I was disappointed with the speaker."
"The product-price ratio is excellent The product is in perfect condition and also includes new charger and cable."
"Excellent equipment in relation to price / quality, recommended it. Battery 100 %, aesthetic I give 92% bring some scratches on the banks but with a case you do not see. Bring mica screen and accessories Generic Cable/Cube."
"Iphone delivered before the agreed date, excellent condition, a few small scratches on the side but it is not noticed by the naked eye, with 94 of condition of battery, I hope so continue, in a few weeks I comment as it was but at the moment in excellent way."
"Everything excellent, phone is perfect conditions and very well packaged, very good experience."
"Aesthetically the cell phone was practically impeccable, however I had to return it, I thought it would arrive with 90% minimum battery health, but I arrived with 82% so it was going to start to get problematic in less than 18 months and minimum that time is the one that I planned to use, you have to consider that changing the battery to any iPhone is expensive and risky, for that reason I had to return it."
"the Iphone came as described by good purchase for the price"
"I arrived very quickly the iphone is very good but the price was excellent"
"Everything excellent, as new, only detail that I do not put 5 stars is the condition of the battery is at 80%"
"I give it a rating of 7 out of 10, it presents some scratches on screen, the edges and on one of the rear cameras. It does not affect the operation but if you notice that it is used. It took a long time to load at first and it heated up, probably it must be by the generic charger, I already change it and I hope it does not trouble me."
"More than satisfied with the purchase. It's the first time I bought a refurbished product and exceeded my expectations. The battery had 94% status, lasts all day. The screen with light scratches and the horn is heard very little, but out of that all well. I recommend it."
"Customer service is the best, the product I received was in perfect condition with a 100% battery"
"The generic camera, fatal."
"Excellent equipment arrived practically new without any details, all to the 100 aesthetic 10/10 battery capacity to 100. Already one month of use and all super well with the equipment."
"Good morning everyone, make this purchase about 2 weeks and the truth only I don't give the 5 stars because the battery came with 81% of life, one is aware since reading the description, but, it wouldn't be bad if ALL came with +90% to be a cell phone of 14,000 pesos."
"I arrived in excellent condition without a scratch and working perfect, excellent purchase"
"Excellent aesthetic phone of 10 Percent of the battery 88% No failure if I buy another one again Considering that this is the 2 iPhone renovated and they come wonderfully."
"It's amazing from the seller was a success when buying this is from my brother and the truth is excellent and it's a great team recommended"
"The price was totally the right one."
"Although it is not the latest iPhone model, the truth is that it arrived in perfect condition, 9.5 aesthetic and the battery came to me with the capacity of 100% A pretty good purchase"
"I had never bought a reconditioning, however I am very satisfied, the product arrived with an aesthetic of 10, without blows and the screen without scratches or anything like that. :)"
"I got an iPhone 11 Pro with 99% battery, impeccable. Practically new. I was very surprised by the quality of the computer!"
"The phone is very good, aesthetically no detail and works at 100, the battery is at 86% of its health, which is very good for a phone that came out in 2019"
"I arrive in a very bad box and the original NOT charger, but the cell phone reached 100, the battery condition reached 84%, 100% original the product, very careful and I arrived in 4 days"
"Battery was at 97% and the aesthetic is 10, without any exterior detail. It also has a mica on the screen. I take a very pleasant surprise with the Amazon Renewed. Even if it comes with generic accessories, it is a great product"
"Excellent service... I got the equipment as new and with a gift screen protector.-Aesthetics 9/10.-Battery 90% gives very good performance.-Send in time and shape. The equipment arrived well packed and without any detail.-Includes charger (fast charge) and generic cable, but functional.Buying a refurbished equipment is a gasse, but this supplier fulfilled what he promised. (Not to mention that it offers you a guarantee of 30 days)."
"Until now I've got a little jamming in with 93% battery, so I think it's a little high the cost in relation to quality, I hope I don't miss in the future"
"It was simply a new motive that they sent me. There is no defect in what I acquired."
"The iPhone by far does not look bad, however it has details like the chrome part that seems to have painted it with nail polish. I had hope for the opinions that were in the article but for my taste it is not worth the price, I prefer to return it for a new one. The battery came at 84% and has a scratch on the screen but as they put a screen protector so that it does not look. If you do not mind the aesthetics is fine for the price. Its functionality is 100%."
"The iPhone arrived in perfect physical condition! 10/10 I have brought it in intensive use to verify battery performance, screen, speakers, Bluetooth, cameras, etc. And so until the day I am happy with my phone. An excellent purchase mine."
"I had some doubts, but the truth is the phone I received is in perfect condition, no scratches on the screen, just a little scratch back (which with a casing is completely gone) microphone, speakers, sensitivity, camera, everything to 100. The battery is in 85 life, but it performs to the maximum."
"I arrived much better than I imagined, excellent purchase I made 100% recommended"
"No complaints, it's a phone blow and I got it at a good price, it brought aesthetics from 10 and battery to 88%, I'd definitely buy it again."
"The equipment was in perfect condition, the battery was 99%... Enchanted with the product for the price"
"The media could not be loaded. The iPhone is flawless with no scratches or dents, the theme is audio, the upper horn is damaged, when you make calls people are not well understood, and if you put it in music playing it sounds like old stereo, it only serves the lower horn, and the battery came to me at the very least of what was promised 81%"
"The iPhone is flawless with no scratches or dents, the theme is audio, the upper horn is damaged, when you make calls people are not well understood, and if you put it in music playing it sounds like old stereo, it only serves the lower horn, and the battery came to me at the rate of what was promised 81%"
"The iPhone works very well, it came with an 86% battery, I would have expected it to be more but what I didn't like is that it comes with a very deep rayon, I say already on the iPhone does not affect the visibility, but if you pass your finger if you feel the rayon, and no, it's not on the mica, I removed the mica thinking it was on the mica, and I realized it was on the glass. Other than that it works well and has no other punch or Rayon on the casing."
"I had a lot of doubts, but it was worth it. Aesthetics of 10 and it works perfectly. The battery came to me 100%."
"It has been a good product, for quality-price so far very well, I bought it 5 months ago and the only details are that the screen sometimes fails the touch and that the battery does not last long."
"Don't hesitate to buy it."
"I do not put 4 stars only because they could improve the quality of the charger with which it comes, moreover, so much quality, wrap, operation and aesthetics of the equipment is a 10 of 10"
"Equipment in super good condition without scratches or anything for the aesthetic style of 100 I recommend super"
"At the moment it looks like new, already check audio, wifi, bluetooth, chip card without problems, battery with 93% of life, to see how it works these days."
"Aesthetically it had arrived with some bumps in the frame and scratches on the screen that were noticed even with the protector they put on it and the horn above sounded (in the beginning) somewhat low, normal if you think it is smaller. up to that point they are subjects that being Renewed can be understandable. But as I was using the equipment the videos were recorded with a low volume as if they were very far away, but at 20 or 30 seconds it sounded with normal volume , in the calls sometimes it sounded as if the other person was very far away and sometimes it was not even heard at 3 or 4 days already it started to sound the upper horn as if it was broken (as if you put a cardboard in front ).I decided to return it because just for what I was going to deal it was not going to use it, the aesthetic was the least at that point but I was not going to be able to use it correctly."
"The product arrived very well Of static no detail, cameras, FaceID, speakers working well It arrived with mica But when I took it away I realized that the screen was scratched, it does not interfere with the display of content and it is not appreciated when putting mica, but if it is considerable the damage on the screen It arrived with a battery of 84%"
"This is the first time that I bought a renovated team and would think that I was in better aesthetic conditions, in particular the team that came to me had very noticeable scratches throughout the frame. In addition to that on the screen part I came with a glass mica wanting to mask the scratches, some of them were very deep and they were noticed too much. On the other hand I got a model that is sold in the US and which does not work at all well with the MX network or at least it is not compatible with the shared network in which I have my plan. Outside the above the team worked well and the battery life was 92% but my decision was to return it since it did not meet my expectations and it was not entirely functional to me."
"It came with 94% battery. It brings a slight scrape by the horn on the bottom, they really do not notice. The charger it brings, is of good quality. Very happy with the purchase :)"
"The phone worked well and aesthetics was fine, I didn't like it because I had a lot of deep scratches on the screen and the battery was 86%, so I decided to return it."
"I arrived a day earlier than indicated The phone comes intact, without any scratch and with battery condition of 96% Widely recommended"
"The product and price are very affordable super recommended!!"
"I had my doubts but the truth arrived super fast and in good condition, the battery arrived with a 91% that considered well, the cell phone arrived with mica of protection and without any rayon almost like new"
"I've been with 5 months and everything's fine so far. I only arrive with a scratch on the screen almost imperceptible. It doesn't bring charger or original cube and comes in an equis box."
"Aesthetics of the 9.9 team. It brings protector in front and rear glass. The reason for the change of my previous team was for the battery. The only “inconvenient” of this iphone is that the maximum battery capacity was 87%. If I had touched one with 95% would have been perfect the purchase. I do not regret it."
"I must admit that at first I had my doubts about buying a semi-new and more equipment online. That there will come a book, a Boing, etc. Or that it will arrive super mistreated. However, be very satisfied with the purchase of the equipment. The equipment arrived the stipulated day The equipment physically is 10 The battery has 91% Horn, cameras, Face ID, charging center and buttons running at 100% I do not know if it was a matter of luck or all your equipment that this supplier manages to be impeccable. No doubt I would acquire some other equipment with them again."
"It works very well everything, pile 85%"
"The cell phone comes in good condition, however, it has a battery usage of 84% which seems to me very low and the hearing aid is heard distorted when playing audio or calls on speaker. In a call with the cell phone attached to the ear it is heard well."
"The cell phone arrived in very good condition. However, after 4 months of use it began to restart and not recognize the battery. As soon as I took it I was told that the battery was in perfect condition, but that I had an error in the base plate of the cell that threw the following log ""panic full"", that explained to me, it is an error that in time will not re-turn the cell phone. So far I continue to restart after 2 hours of use and in restart loops up to 6 hours!!!!!!! Check your products before the Amazon warranty is finished"
"Good iPhone 11 Pro team, although it was a little scratched the screen, battery 92%."
"It arrived early and without any scratch had aesthetics 10 out of 10"
"I had my doubts about being reconditioned... but it has served me very well... and has not presented any faults."
"I received the product before the time indicated. It came as new, battery at 95%, without scratches. I have been with him for two months and so far it has worked very well."
"I decided for this type of article reconstructed by its price, which is not compared to a new one. This in particular came well with what was described in the publication, although it has a very small detail in cover has nothing to do with its operation. Everything else well, the battery has more than 80% capacity and the brand supports its operation. I recommend it."
"Everything arrived in excellent condition without any problem, and everything works perfectly."
"I like the iPhone because I get very fast and barely has a tiny rayon, the health of the battery has it 100% and for the moment the cell phone is working well and without problems, I update if I get to have faults."
"It was the first time I acquired a cell phone through Amazon Renewed and I do not regret it. The cell phone arrived in good condition, practically as new. :)"
"It fulfills what you mention as it came the next day if you bought it; after checking it all came almost like a new iPhone with the battery at 100%. It only came with a small stripe caused in the notch but that did not prevent the operations of the cell phone and aesthetically almost not noticeable."
"Actually, I had my doubts about being a “renewed” team, however everything turned out to be excellent, I received a phone below average cost and in perfect condition, not a scratch and aesthetic of 100. The functionality, perfect, as if coming from Apple. Congratulations to Amazon for offering these products that would otherwise be more difficult to access. This purchase is a guarantee of service and quality."
"It arrived in very good condition, the battery at 86, aesthetically 9.5, functionality 10, on the accessories (cable and charger) includes what it indicates in the description, are generic. It would definitely buy a restored one again."
"Equipment with the quality of a new one, quality-price is the best"
"Hello good night to acquire an iPhone 11 pro but I already put a chip att& and I appear error in call could help me"
"The screen does not work properly"
"3 months with it and it works perfectly. A little worn out the pile but it does not cause me problems."
"The battery has a state of 99%, aesthetically seen to 98% only has details of use in the corners of the right side, I did not expect so much of a reconditioned product, I only have 1 week with the cell phone, to see how it goes after"
"The shipment was very fast, the equipment is in general terms, well, some scratches but nothing excessive and operates very well; I recommend the seller"
"the team in perfect condition everything works properly"
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, with the battery 100% and without a scratch, seemed new"
"In relation to the price the equipment is fine, it only has a few small scrapes on the sides of the screen, what I do not like anything is that the equipment is too hot, but in itself, you could say that the equipment is fine"
"The phone works perfectly, but this one came with the scratched screen and I didn't get noticed of this at first because it had a mica on it, apparently they put that mica on it so it wouldn't be noticed. Had I noticed before I would have returned it. Check very well the phones you buy with this seller."
"GOOD PRESENTATION AND FUNCTIONING"
"It looks and works perfect."
"Well, the team came to me fast, only it came very worn out from the pile and the screen with a lot of scratches."
"The phone arrived in the conditions specified in the description. The battery came with a life of 97%, although after not many weeks of one it went down to 94%. Other than that, the phone works perfectly. The cameras have no problem and aesthetically the phone is integrated. As the phone was imported from the United States, it came out a little more expensive and it was a little longer than if I had bought it in Mexico, however, personally this gave me a little more confidence."
"Excellent condition no scratch all well battery I guess calibrated as long as it lasts all day super recommended"
"The product came with a mica and they looked stripes on the screen, try to change the mica to fix the bug and it is the screen that is scratched, they are not light scratches. Amazon should not put that they are certified by Amazon if they do not verify the quality offered"
"IT'S A WHOLE NEW CELLULAR, IT DIDN'T PRESENT SOME GOLPE OR DETAIL, JUST THAT IT DOESN'T SEE IN A ORIGINAL CARTON, AND THE CARGER IS GENERICAL, BUT IT DOES COMPLETE WITH A GOOD FUNCTIONING"
"Product without any defect if you review it in detail notes almost null lines on screen, I do not like the chargers q are not original nor that it does not bring the AirPod as cable, nor original box but it is understood. The truth if I recommend a renewed and the best arrive two days before the established"
"The iPhone is in excellent condition, almost as if it were new, the bad thing? As the post says it does not have hearing aids, the problem is that it comes in a generic box with charger and cable also generic medium-low quality really what you buy is just the smartphone"
"The product is just what they offer, it works with Telcel and at&t, I had no trouble updating and putting my iCloud.It comes in generic box, with generic accessories,"
"I liked the product in general only that it is something small. But it is an excellent purchase"
"The media could not be loaded. The equipment came well packaged in an acrylic box, it is not the original or accessories because it is refurbished but it works perfect has 93% in battery life and the aesthetic I give it a 9.5"
"The equipment came well packaged in an acrylic box, it is not the original or accessories because it is reconditioned but it works perfect has 93% in battery life and the aesthetic gives it a 9.5"
"As new without any aesthetic problem and with battery above 90%, excellent buy so far."
"He saved me and it works great."
"The first team I acquired was with a 99% aesthetic and the battery in excellent condition, only that it had a screen edge without sensitivity in the touch, so we had to return it, but the second team I received is in excellent condition, with a 100 aesthetic and working perfectly so far"
"The team arrived with many details on the screen too many for the quality price ratio"
"the product looks like new and for the beautiful super beien"
"Mild aesthetic details not visible to the naked eye rear and front cameras working perfectly face id and sensors working properly"
"It comes without box and original accessories, but for the very good price. Battery life 90%"
"I don't have 2 months with the product and I can no longer take photos or video, says that the sale you have 90 days and I find disabled the option of refund or replacement, they handle a term of 31 days"
"With two days of use the cell phone has worked very well, physically it did not bring any details, the state of the battery is at 87%"
"I have a week with the phone, so far everything excellent, looks brand new"
"The cell phone arrived on the estimated day, with 99% of the battery condition, although I have not recalibrated it, I have not even a month with the cell phone, until now very well, it came in generic box with generic charger, but they work quite well, it also comes with the clip necessary for the SIM, nor found a single detail, although I already dropped a couple of times and only scratched a little on the banks, it came with mica."
"I like it, it has no original packaging, it includes charger and generic cable, but the phone looks practically new, the price is good but I have seen it cheaper, I bought it by Amazon because it is a little safer to buy and how easy it is to make a return... but so far everything is perfect with iPhone..."
"I arrive well, in perfect condition, a week later they continue offering it 1500 mxn cheaper nor mode. The cell phone is in perfect battery condition at 94%. Zero scratches. I arrive in a generic box and the accessories (cable, charger) are equally generic. That is not the original ones. Fully unlocked"
"It is a good price and it is very nice indeed an excellent purchase and comes in excellent condition"
"Excellent!!! I arrive in 2 days, it brings some minor aesthetic details, but the truth is that for the price is super good. I have been using it for a few days and so far everything perfect! The performance of the stack brings it to 80%"
"I have received the mobile phone and arrived in perfect condition! I was not able to find some scratch even, everything looks great! The battery seems to be at 95% and came with a screen protector already installed, I hope that everything remains like this ... if not because they sent it in an ordinary box, anyone would think that it received a new iPhone Update: I have been with my cell phone since December 2020, the battery has decreased its capacity to 93% but it has already been like this for several months, nothing has failed in the device and I do not regret having bought it."
"It's my first iPhone and I was nervous (like many of you who read this) and I didn't know if it was safe, I was encouraged because after all Amazon sent the purchase, it came to me in a day and in the box that is shown in the photo, that the truth is not bad. The cell phone came impeccable and with a battery state at 99%, without scratches in the back (in the front it doesn't seem to have anything, already comes a mica for what is appreciated) Anyway, if you want to try iPhone and almost half price, it is a good option. :D"
"It's a big purchase, the phone came to me with a 90% battery and still the same. Aesthetically it's 100%"
"I came up with a battery with 87% wear but after 2 weeks I returned it because in just 2 weeks low up to 84 aesthetically was perfect and in terms of performance also, if it hadn't been for the battery I would give it a 10 out of 10"
"Excellent product, I had my doubts but now I am a very satisfied customer"
"It arrived without any visible scratches, brings crystal mica for the screen and the condition of the battery came to 96%. I have been using it for 1 week and so far I have not had any problem. Very happy with my purchase!"
"I get there fast, looks new, batteries at 92%, it's worked well"
"Good team, with good aesthetics, the problem was the distortion of the horn, and I won't have to return it."
"The camera doesn't focus and when it tries to focus it makes strange noises."
"Works without fail"
"THE TELEPHONE CAME WITHOUT ESTETICAL DETAILS BUT TO USE IT AND CONNECTING IT TO A BOCINE MEASURED BY BLUETOOTH, THE IPHONE CALLED A LOT, ALSO WHEN THEY TALKED BY TELEPHONE. THE BATTERY HAD QUICK QUICK, TAKING THE MIDDLE DAY 30% AND A MODERATE USE FROM 8 AM."
"The article supposes to be of use but it really came without any scratch, the screen works perfect, it has 90% battery so we can say that it is almost new"
"I arrive in time, it has superficial details on the screen like small scratches, but what mattered most was the battery life, came with 73% so it had to be returned."
"The phone arrived well packed, in good aesthetic condition, only the battery arrived in an 86% service life, but I do not complain, for the price is very good purchase and the phone will still hold for at least a year before replacing the battery."
"I arrive in good condition, well packed and it works without problems, only the condition of the battery is 81%, from there everything is perfect"
"It arrived in perfect condition, without any visible scratches. Apart the battery is at 100! Only the cable that arrived is of poor quality, but that is the least. Excellent purchase"
"Good equipment, good aesthetic, with screen protector and good % in battery condition. Only detail does not come with orginal accessories (does not include earpods) and in this case is not fast charging charger."
"I was afraid to buy my first refurbished cell phone, I don't regret it. I got it with 100% battery, and very few aesthetic details. I would buy it again,"
"I doubted the security of the purchase, however the cell phone arrived in time and shape, the condition of the equipment is as if it were new. I am really surprised, I arrived with a generic charger and a mica included, the state of the battery is not the best but it is certainly what you expect for the price, certainly it was a good purchase."
"After 7 months of removing the glass that I had on the screen I notice a few scratches. Beware of that, if it comes to them with glass take it off and check it. Operating is 100, if I would buy it again."
"The equipment was physically in good condition except for a slight scrape it had in the upper frame, the bad thing was that it had the lower horn blown and the battery in very low battery condition. Everything else was fine."
"Very good product"
"It does not work properly, The connector is useless and I cannot load it. I have sent an email to the provider to request the replacement or return and no one answers me. The 90 day warranty offered by the provider seems to be a lie. The 30 days offered by Amazon have already passed and I cannot return it to them."
"Phone in excellent condition. Operation has no complaint"
"The phone so far arrived well, I arrived 2 days after I asked for it, I arrived with a 90% visual, the screen a little scratched, but they are minimal, very good battery. So far everything well"
"The team arrived in excellent condition not a single detail and the health of the battery to 100 I certainly do not regret trusting in Amazon renewed premium."
"My iPhone 11 Pro arrived in perfect condition (with very minimal aesthetic details that are not even seen at first sight) and with battery of almost 90% of life. 6 months after buying it it still works perfectly."
"All great this new one literally came to me with 98% battery and I overwhelm my expectations."
"Excellent article, expected to come with details and yes, the detail was a small scratch on the edge, but the battery at 100% and zero failures, I recommend"
"Of aesthetics I give it a 9.5 because the screen came with a slight rayon but from there on out everything right"
"It's quite useful, almost as new, just turn off the screen very occasionally but turn the system on in seconds (I guess that's why they returned it) price ratio pretty good! I would buy one like this again"
"It wasn't what I expected, it came incomplete without cable or charger."
"It arrived on the right day. Physically. The phone arrived very well packed, it came with a generic charger and cable but with quality certificate, and aesthetically 100%, it also brought its crystal mica. Functionality. So far everything goes excellent, the battery with 100% performance and for use I give it I last two full days, bunks two days with its two nights, so if I recommend it. Thank you!"
"Everything works well, it is an excellent product due to the quality and the price, I arrived with 100% battery health and has not given me any fault, recommended!!"
"I am very disappointed in the purchase, the team presents deep scratches on the screen, the front horn is dirty and does not work properly, would not buy renewed with the criteria that Amazon mexico handles"
"Good product, works as if it were new, the screen has the true tone and checking with the 3utools have not replaced parts, so the battery to 84% that still lasts all day without problems, does not heat and runs super well all the applications, the only detail is a scratch on the screen but it is imperceptible"
"The phone arrived as new without details of use and without any scratch, the only bad thing were the box and the accessories not original, is a very good purchase for the price and is worth"
"Everything was going well. At 4 months it stopped working: it went out of nowhere and never went back on. I will never buy Amazon’s refurbished ones again. At that price I get cheaper a new one that will last me a few years and not a few months."
"This is one of the best purchases I have made, the cell phone is practically new, has no physical detail and still has its Mica and has 100% battery, although as mentioned the accessories are generic just like the box for me was not inconvenient, the price is for less than half than a new one, so if you have the opportunity and money is a very good option."
"Notice that the cell phone was somewhat dirty, at first I thought it was lightning bolts but after cleaning it was very good. Only a few very small scratches on the screen, minimum. Battery with 98% service life and generic charger and current cable as indicated Small details that make the first impression when opening it not so pleasurable, plus I understand that it is not a new %100 equipment."
"Excellent product as new, I already have since March using it and I did not fail even a little, all perfect generic charger that includes this excellent super fast load to 100 my equipment. Not a single flawless scrape equipment. Despite being reconditioning works perfectly. I had already purchased one since December 2020 and still works perfectly."
"For the price it was to be expected that the product came with details, the screen comes intact, the battery at 93%, and if it has aesthetic details that are to be expected."
"Equipment in good condition in general, only with some markings or scratches on the screen, do not deliver original accessories, the charger did not comply with the Volts and Amps that an original charger requires."
"The phone has visible damage I didn't use it I would expect it to work well. Aesthetically I give you 5 you can't possibly not send it even with charger."
"I must accept that I bought cell with fear. But after watching videos and reviews I was encouraged and I must confess that it is one of the best purchases I have made. It works perfectly, I only had a couple of minimal scrapes that are not noticed. For the 100% recommended price"
"Very good team"
"I work well the first month, at the moment it is causing me problems with touch, it does not close applications, it does not let me go down and increase brightness and volume, the condition of the battery under 5% in a matter of 1 month of use, I would like to know what applies in this case. Greetings."
"I did not like it, because aesthetically it looked very deteriorated with respect to the price apart from the life of the battery very degraded by 80%"
"The battery is in perfect condition, and in general it doesn't even seem renewed this as new"
"I am fascinated with the super good purchase the condition of the battery came in 94% which I find excellent, I only had a problem with the screen that when removing the mica that already comes included the screen is very scratched, but when placing glass mica as if nothing!"
"It's really an excellent choice price/quality, I highly recommend it, you can buy with security, tax returned me 13 USD, phenomenal. I arrive in Mexico super fast."
"Be careful and check the number of the model, as in my recent case I realized that it is not compatible with band 28 in Mexico"
"I have been in use for several weeks and this excellent, looks almost like new, is an excellent option if you are looking to change equipment!"
"Excellent condition of the phone, works wonderfully and was a good upgrade of the 7 that I had to this one. The fact of being “renewed” has not affected anything so I highly recommend it, the battery of mine reached 100% that was what I worried most and the aesthetic had not a single detail"
"It came to me, it lasted one day and it went out and it didn't start anymore, I tried to reboot forced by DFU. And no. I returned it."
"The cell phone came in perfect condition? it would hit 98% of its capacity. the only detail is that it comes in any box and with a fake charger but it still works."
"The product arrived intact, it seems as if it had been removed from the apple box and sent, not a single rayon. Yes it came with screen protector on, stack capacity at 100%, capacity if it is the one mentioned, face ID works normal, super fast shipping 1 day and I had no trouble to use it since if it was 100% unlocked."
"A lousy product with lots of scratches and it doesn't seem close to being like new is a product with a lot of use"
"Super well the team, quite satisfied"
"The battery status is 97%. It looks like new, has no aesthetic defects, a very small point in a corner and a small scratch near the charging port. It works well, cameras, buttons, touch screen, speakers, speakers, microphones and FaceID."
"I arrive in excellent condition and packed and so far works super well"
"The product arrived in bad condition as the screen came with a very deep rayon , it even looks crashed, the horn of calls is heard snoring and with noise and the packaging remains much to want, the battery had 82% and it is warmed when carrying it as it arrives with 10%"
"The team came in excellent condition, perhaps some scratch or scratch but almost imperceptible"
"It seemed like new without any detail and with the battery at 100% but it was weird that I had projector glass, at 3 months the protective glass crashed little and when I took it away to put another one I saw that the screen was scratched and with the crystal it did not notice anything. If I realized from the beginning that it was so scratched I would return it without thinking about it."
"It was an excellent purchase, it cost me 60% of what I should have paid for a new equipment, and the functions so far have been as if it were. Unless it doesn’t have the original accessories and box, it could go through a new device"
"Good product, hurts battery life"
"The equipment looks really new, comes with its generic cable and charger as well as a key. It has a light and not visible stripes on the screen but is expected. The battery is at 90% of its capacity. I think it is a good purchase"
"It is completely new outdoors, 85% battery and cable life and generic connection box. Good!"
"The cell phone if it is in 8.6 aesthetic, the only drawback is the battery, it lasts between 3 hours of maximum use, but taking into account the price and the price of the replacement is proportional to the cost."
"That looks new."
"As far as aesthetics came Perfect but it came to me with a condition of 83% which I do not take importance recognizing that it is renewed, I had a failure in the bosina that almost nothing was heard, more than that the cameras looked little blurred."
"It came to me with the microphone not working, I don't think they will review them as mentioned in the publication."
"When I just opened the product it looked perfect. Not a single scratch. My first doubt was when I turned it on. It didn’t work the power button. After I turned it on when I connected it with the light cable started the configuration process. The cell phone was constantly blocked and the typical sound of blocking the iPhone was heard. It was impossible to use the mobile so, however after a while I managed to configure it. I tried to upgrade it to iOS version 14.3 (the last one to this day) hoping that this would solve the problem, however, when it was being installed the mobile went out (I think because of the false one that had the side button) and when it was turned off when the firmware was updated it became useless and didn’t work any more, only by turning it on in recovery mode. I tried to update it and recover it from iTunes, however, it marked me error one time and again and unfortunately, after several attempts, I had to return it. Apparently it was a failure of the hardware that didn’t “react” when I released it on sale. I read very good reviews and other good orders about the cellulars and I did it, and I think that it’s a matter of luck."
"It's the first time I've bought a renewed cell phone and I've been totally surprised and satisfied. I have 3 days with it and everything has gone right, I'll update this comment again in 3 months after using it (before the warranty runs out) has a small scratch on the top but nothing that affects the device"
"The cell phone came to me with the stack Just 80%, I said it's not bad but at the time of loading it it was too hot I said well I let it pass but when I put my chip/if card not make poor with others and less, I return it."
"the product physically this impeccable very nice , works well the only detail is that it breaks down the loaders and it is impossible to be buying original loaders every two weeks I carry 3 loaders brand apple bought directly that they decompose and also decompose the generic that they sent me in 1 week but I believed at the beginning that it was because it was not the original the other loaders then I saw it as coincidence but because already faith much is how long they last try to see the policy of 90 days of warranty but on any side they appear not started to buy because to be able to try 30 days is very little time to know that failures have"
"But it had 84% battery life and about 500 cycles of load. I returned it"
"I had my doubts that the phone would arrive in good condition without aesthetic or operational details but I took a pleasant surprise to receive it without any aesthetic damage, operating without problems and with its battery to 99% of life, Semi-new as New. In addition I arrived two days earlier than scheduled. Total satisfaction."
"I like that the aesthetic of what I buy even when it is used this to 10 of 10 here as I buy it through Amazon because I can not see it physically, The only detail that has that I see that is two sides come mistreated from there out all right!!"
"I was afraid it was a scam but in the end it was worth the purchase. The phone is practically new without any aesthetic detail. I get it in 2 days, only the packaging is the bad thing and it does not come in its original box or original charger but for the price is fine, it remains in second term. I arrive with 94% battery life, it is perfect."
"Product as new, with 85% battery , does not come with original box neither charger nor accessories"
"I already have 3 months of use more or less and everything has been excellent, since I got it came with 100% battery life and screen protector, obviously comes in another box and with another charger but it is the least, the best purchase !!!"
"Good general condition only microrays that are seen paying a lot of attention. I do not like that a week they made a very good discount."
"Best!! Equipment like new pineapple at 97% and no wear in general.Only the charger is of low quality because the cable they include is good.In general a very good purchase; I will wait to have more use time with it to give more details."
"Very good phone."
"Aesthetic 10/10, not a scratch, in perfect condition. I scanned it in 3utools and everything is original, more than 300 charges with 93% battery. It arrived with 95%, but it went down after the setup. It is a little slow the scrolling on screen, but it will be a matter of using it more to see if it is any fault"
"Enchanted with the Product!"
"The phone comes in a generic box, with generic charger and cable, it's in excellent condition, what you see is what you get said it might have some physical defect but in my case it wasn't, it serves 100 me only if I recommend you buy the original accessories. I'm happy"
"I had my doubts when buying a refurbished cell phone, but the one I bought came as NEW! the battery is 100%, has no details (more than a little scratch on the screen) than with a good protector is not appreciated. The phone comes completely released and brings a generic charger and cable. I am very happy of my purchase and the money I have saved myself! (besides contriiburing to the environment)"
"It came to me in perfect condition, it seemed new, it works 100% and the battery is almost 100, with 85%. I bought it several months ago and I have not had any problems. Super happy with my purchase!"
"When you buy a repaired equipment you run the risk of defects. In this case it is a shame in the case of calls. If I am in one, it is cut without notice. Two seconds later another call comes that makes the previous one cut."
"I arrive in excellent condition and with 96% battery, aesthetically looks like new, very careful, arrived with crystal mica, the only detail was that it did not arrive in original box and the charger is generic."
"In general the cell phone was in good condition, with 88% battery but what I didn't like was that it had quite deep scratches and that they didn't show because it had the protective mica but when I took it off I realized that and I better return it. They should stop fooling the buyer with that."
"The phone comes as new, I just found a little scratch and nothing else, I've been using it without any faults or problems, I was hoping that the battery would have some wear and when I checked the performance I found it at 100, the non-original charger, it's what I didn't like"
"The team arrived in excellent condition. It really meets all expectations, the battery in 100% condition and without any detail."
"The phone is delivered to you with a mica already on and it looks like a glue doesn't matter at first, the surprise comes when you remove it the screen is super scratched I understand that they are renewed products but it's an excess the damage on the screen you see the mice of normal use but besides that it brings several scratches already pronounced on the screen it seems to be quarted"
"I arrived in perfect condition, I was a little nervous as to how the equipment would arrive, but I practically got how new, no scratch, the battery at 100% of its capacity. Plus it came with a glass mica on. If not because it comes in a generic box with generic accessories I would believe it is totally new. It no longer has limited warranty from Apple, but with Amazon warranty it is perfect."
"I actually had my doubts about making my purchase but in the end everything went well, the team arrived on time and conditions that I did not imagine, I recommend it 100% to my experience."
"The cell phone outside OK. Already when I set it up it turns out that the battery has 77% of capacity when according to Amazon this cell phone should have above 80%. Already the same cell phone sends me notice that the battery is very degraded and should be given maintenance because it is very degraded according to the same iPhone. It is assumed that Amazon should have checked it before but it did not. I will return it immediately and no longer buy more renewed products, better to raise money and buy a new one. I am already tired of giving many opportunities to Amazon mobile reconditionings, towel throw."
"The packaging being generic gave me a little distrust but the phone arrived in excellent condition, aesthetic to 100, I checked in a program the parts of the phone and all of factory, not to fail so far.. I recommend it for the price and the months without interest"
"The phone is in very good condition, of aesthetics I give you a 10, the life of the battery is 100%, certainly I am very satisfied of this purchase, the accessories are not original but they work very well, but in the publication they indicate it, the box is generic and in conclusion the phone is divine and at a super price"
"The phone came in with too many scratches and bumps on the edges and besides the horn sounded very bad, it hurt I had to come back"
"Low battery performance"
"The article came as promised, now I just hope it will last well in the long term."
"AN ABSOLUTA VERGÜENZA THAT AMAZON SAYS THAT THE REFABRICATED TELEPHONES WERE REVISED AND TESTED BY “EXPERTS” TO LIGHT AND FUNCTION AS NEW.The phone I got did not run out of signal in an Intermittent way, making it practically useless. It also heated disproportionately. Being at rest it reached temperatures as if you were playing. I imagine that both problems are related and lie in the motherboard of the phone. Absolute shame."
"The cell phone reaches me super fast, they come in generic box. It is original product, of aesthetics I give 10 and battery 10. I already have 5 months using it and without any problem the truth."
"I was in perfect condition, 100% battery, I was worried that it would get damaged or some aesthetic problem but no, I was really surprised."
"The product comes in the best conditions but I did not like the measurements and very small and I want to change it for a version PRO MAX...Is it possible to make this change?"
"Equipment without signal, i.e. not released for Telcel at least and heated when loaded"
"The device came packed in a generic box (as expected), with a generic charger and cable.The appearance of the device is impeccable, it has no scratch or signal of previous use.It came with everything and a tempered glass already pre-installed.Only the installation of my AppleID was somewhat laborious, because the device was not updated and asked to be updated to the latest version of iOS so I could move my contents from my old iPhone."
"The only thing I didn't like is that they're not original, the bucket and cable to charge the phone."
"Unfortunately I had 2 problems but the main one is that when I opened it came a battery of steen and low quality audiophones that were also broken"
"The product has PESIMO wireless performance. It is very difficult to connect with WiFi networks and Bluetooth also has very poor performance. It actually becomes a useless product. I WANT TO CHANGE IT PLEASE"
"Never buy refurbished Amazon. In less than 3 months I already had to change the battery and the screen just came out of the green line. Anyway, my mistake to buy refurbished and not factory."
"The iphone comes in perfect condition. I thought it could come some bad, but it didn't. It comes with a cable and a bucket to load (they are not original) but they perfectly fulfill their function.It comes even with a protective mesh for the opposite side.I had an iphone and it didn't cost me ANY work to pass my information from one phone to another.It comes totally unlocked.Good purchase!! :)"
"I'm having cell phone problems like I can to return it since I was told I had a 90-day warranty."
"NO SIGNAL. After 3 months of warranty the phone stopped receiving signal I did SIM failure tests and nothing changed to ESIM and it was still not working. DO NOT GET THIS EQUIPMENT Since the 3-month warranty is of no use if it is going to stop working on day 91."
"I've previously bought refurbished and it's been good experience, so I decided to buy again and it wasn't the exception."
"The device comes with charger and generic box, within a few months the Face ID stops working and has no guarantee for it."
"I bought the iPhone 11 Pro and everything in perfect condition, arrived in time and the only drawback is that for the 15k you pay the battery came to 85% quite worn out, although aesthetically it seems new."
"The aesthetic conditions of the phone are incredible, it could actually go through a new phone, the state of the battery was 93 which was to be expected, it comes in a different box and the cable and bucket to charge it are not original, but it is understood by being Renewed. The truth if you are thinking about buying one like that, don't hesitate"
"All excellent, I'd buy again."
"I liked how well taken care of the phone, it hurts that I didn't touch those who have more than 90% of battery life, it cost me 14900 in hotsale to have price reference"
"The screen looks horrible, clearly not the original, for the price of the product should worry about at least putting the original"
"It came to me in very good condition as new I was skeptical but I was surprised"
"The phone had light scratches, nothing considerable in its function only in aesthetics I would give it in 90% of grade in aesthetics and battery 88% but in general all good generic charger and cable"
"The phone arrived in very good aesthetic conditions and included a tempered glass, I think it touched my luck because the battery was 100%. Perhaps the only thing that I did not like very much were the generic accessories but it was very good purchase, if I recommend it."
"I arrived in perfect condition does not present visible brands and brings battery condition of 94, comes in generic box and with generic charger but for the price I do not complain the equipment that is the main comes super well"
"This amazing equipment the truth, this impeccable, battery to 95%, , I am very satisfied, excellent service, with the charger if they look a bit bad, mostly the charging bucket, but it is worth since as I comment my equipment is really new."
"I arrived with a battery at 95% health and almost as new, has almost imperceptible marks on the screen but it is to be expected of a renewed product, I would like you to bring the original charger but as for what offered everything is well"
"The iPhone arrived in time and form.It does not present physical details.Battery 99%.IMEI no reportExcellent purchase, practically new!!Refurbished is great option.I have only 2 days using the phone but no problem."
"I've been testing it and save the battery that reaches 94%, everything else so far working very well"
"The excellent product, had no physical details speaking, the battery at 100% and so far everything has worked properly"
"The equipment basically as new, without any brand, the only thing the battery to 91% of life however it lasts a long time, since 4 days I have the equipment I have only charged it 2 times, in truth I am very happy with the purchase."
"Buying a Renewed Cell phone with Amazon is equivalent to buying a semi-new certificate with 3 months warranty, is the 3rd time I buy a renewed and always exceed my expectations, arrived super fast, unlocked, minimum details 9.5/10 (only the normal scratches that are made to iPhones with stainless steel edges) battery with condition 96% works everything 100% and if you stop doing it Amazon backs you for 3 months, certainly an excellent purchase"
"Again BuySpry doesn’t leave me bad. Good cell phone, good battery condition, and aesthetics like a new iPhone. Even the original n cable and charger accessories work and give fast charging."
"I arrive quite well, in generic box, with cube and generic cable.No aesthetic defects and with stack at 93%Very good option."
"The equipment came impeccably and with 93% battery. The only ""defect"" are the chargers with which you send it but it is quite worth it since the equipment in question of operation and aesthetics is at a million"
"On Saturday May 28th I received the cell phone, at first sight it was in perfect condition. All OK until today Tuesday May 31, when I received an update of IOS 15.5 and detected a fault in the screen and battery, when entering the link sends me directly to a page of suggestions to go to the technical service of APPLE, arguing that the pieces are of inferior quality."
"Don't grab the signal without the internet!!! Help"
"I'm surprised at the state, it doesn't have a single scratch on the screen, nor the edges, so I read in the other comments, I was lucky. The battery works at 94%. Excellent!"
"No aesthetic details, but Face ID doesn't work"
"I knew it was rebuilt but already iPhone only had the casing, the screen looked very opaque colors, nothing to do with any iPhone 5 screen from now on, plus it was the operating system at a time and the touch didn't work properly, I had to return it. That if they didn't have a problem giving me back the money just make sure to unsubscribe from the iCloud before returning it."
"Despite not being new package, they are in very good condition, it is worth it since they come as new and for a much lower price, with respect to the box is also generic the charger but insist, for the price and quality of the product is worth and I recommend it quite much."
"I arrive very used, blows everywhere, generic charger not functional. 70% battery"
"The truth is that it arrived very fast, I bought it on Sunday 27th of Dec and I arrived on Tuesday 29, the box was generic as well as the cable usb and the charger but of good quality, the battery of the device with 97% useful life, aesthetic of 9.9, the truth I am happy with the purchase."
"In value for money is the best option, the cell phone came as new, although I looked for no rayon or imperfection. I recommend it 100%."
"Very good product, with two small scratches but not especially noticeable with cover"
"Too many scratches on the screen and back, very damaged chromes and if you use it for some time it gets warmed up"
"Excellent cell phone as new battery at 100% the bad thing is that it comes in generic box and generic charger but the equipment impeccable, it would be good that for a few more weights they included box and original charger"
"I bought it for myself, so far it works perfect, it doesn't heat up, it charges fast, it came with charger (not brand) and it came in box (not brand)."
"I was in doubt if I should buy it because I didn't know if the team would be in good condition, and I was surprised that the team arrived impeccable, great price, it doesn't have a scratch, the battery is at 100, it's practically new, I'm very happy."
"They deceive the buyer by hiding the defects.I do not recommend buying this type of items, they always bring details, in my case, I did not immediately realize that the screen had scratches as the product included a mica of tempered glass, when I replaced it I took the surprise that the screen presented many imperfections."
"I arrive with the loudspeakers blown and the volume level seems altered, it sounds almost nothing."
"I bought an iPhone 11 pro of 256 gb with 100% battery life and only having received 30 charging cycles, a minimum scratch on a side that already with a cover is not even noticed. Completely satisfied, good purchase."
"I was quite surprised, the product arrived intact and in perfect condition. Indeed, the accessories are generic, but if you had already had iPhone, this is not a problem. Until today it has worked very well. I am very happy with my purchase!"
"1.- The battery does not last anything brings it to 86%.2.- It comes blocked with USA I can not use my telephone network.3.- It is heated within 20 minutes of using it.4.- The generic charger is overheated only use it 1 time.5.- I can not make change of anything with warranty because it is from the United States and here it is not worth the guarantee of apple.Total scam."
"The phone works well but the screen has many scratches which are very visible.The battery barely reaches 82% of life."
"The phone aesthetically looked good, but unfortunately I didn’t recognize the chip, so I can’t say anything about it, as I had to return it"
"I had my doubts but I arrived super well, without any scratch or anything like that, mine arrived with 99% battery. I have been almost 1 month with him and everything super well, recommended!"
"The phone meets expectations, very good product and in excellent condition."
"Super good offer, came as new, no scratches and damage"
"Today I received the cell phone, aesthetically I give it a 10/10, the battery condition appears with 100%. The charger is generic (as I said in the description) and does not bring anything else. So far all well, after 2 months I share how it goes."
"It's the wrong color :( It costs a lot to get there wrong."
"When I arrived I thought that I had been conned since the packaging and box are of another type, the phone arrived in excellent conditions 0 scratches would give it a 10 out of 10 and had 91% useful life in the battery, it works all the charger is generic but if it works."
"Excellent product recommended"
"The truth was my experience was neutral. If the quality of the battery was above 80%, it is not true that they come “as new.” I touched a fully used computer came hit and cracked in the back. There is a big difference between a renovated computer and a second-use computer, but well the price is acceptable for the original value and little depreciation of an iPhone."
"It's the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon."
"A wonder, the iPhone arrived without a scratch, the battery at 95% and everything working perfect. Practically new."
"Terrible, I had my doubts but after reading several good reviews encourage me to ask for it, the worst mistake I have made, arrived in terrible condition, grated screen, has no lid for the chip input, has nibbled sides, does not have a front piece next to the front flash, and to finish not even charge.It still does not charge anything after hours.It probably does not have battery.A complete scam0/10 in general"
"I only had one hit on the corner and very small spiders on the screen. Nothing that affected the operation. To be the maximum capacity was a bargain, very nice and the battery at 100%."
"Excellent purchase taking advantage of the discount that there was, arrived a day earlier than expected.Aesthetics 10/10 has not a single detail on the screen either on the edges or from the back.Battery 97% of lifeIn addition comes with a screen protector included"
"It's all very well unless I don't get in the apple box."
"The product as new a slight stain on the edge where the cell phone is blocked but it is minimal, comes with a glass on the screen already integrated, the battery this full 100% very good purchase has no details is very good investment"
"In the publication it says it comes with a minimum of 90% battery life but I get it with 86%. Personally I will return it because I expected more of the cell phone."
"Today I received my cell phone, aesthetically 10/10... what causes conflict is that I can't use my cell phone because it asks me for an alphanumeric code, I tried to enter a number that was stuck in the back, which I thought was the code but it isn't. I didn't keep trying because the cell phone started blocking as the password wasn't the right one.If someone could help me, I would appreciate it."
"I acquired the phone on October 4, 2020 and on November 5, I no longer wanted to turn it on and take it to ishop mixep to repair it and they told me that there was nothing to do that was useless. Only 3 months I was hard and I didn't fall or anything, don't give your money by buying a refurbished cell they find much better to buy it new, I'm still paying it and it doesn't work anymore."
"It is in excellent condition, the iPhone comes with 99% of the battery life. It has a bit scraped on the banks, but nothing from the other world and with cover no longer noticed.Excellent purchase, especially for the price."

"I arrived well, fast and in very good condition. My husband was the happiest, I a pco later I will buy mine!! :)"
"Excellent product. Very good quality. I just give you 2 stars because they didn't send me the little key to get the SIM card. If they send it to me I change my score."
"iphone in perfect condition, came with 98% battery life literally like new the only detail is in the package since it is generic and does not have the shit nor the original chargers of apple"
"Incredible! It exceeded my expectationsThe battery is in perfect condition and at a good cost, it reached me next day to my home.No doubt I would buy anotherThank you"

"The phone came in like new, no scratches or punches."
"I was waiting for Amazon's guarantee that they would check the cell phones with some more rigor. The phone was in very bad condition of the screen and had a scratch that was very noticeable even 1 arm away, as the warranty mentions. That's why I returned it, but the user experience with the refund is definitely deficient :(("

"All right with the cell phone, not a scratch, everything in order."
"Very bad experience, physically it brought scrapes and blows, the speakers were not heard and had no original internal parts . The same system of the iPhone did not recognize the pieces as the screen and audio and marked error. I do not understand how they can sell products as defective. “I do not recommend it”"

The other came with visible marks, on screen and frames, more battery at 83%, the truth expected more, both work well, but I think the 2nd iPhone was more to get into state ""very good"", not in excellent.

"Good evening, sincerely highly recommended, it reached 100, aesthetic 99, only a very small rayon back, the screen at 100, the battery at 100, when they send it to you they send a key so that that key will be given to the parcel store, yes , the delivery man told me that you have to check the product at the moment why to a person did not arrive anything that at the moment he asked me to check to see that the product is there , waited for me to serve them my summary, greetings from Cordoba Veracruz, living Mexico"
"In general the cell phone works very well, I have been with 3 months and until now everything works perfectly, in aesthetics the cell phone had a few small scratches on the screen but nothing that affects and to see them you must see it in detail, in the day to day they do not notice, the condition of the battery reaches 87, which until now after 3 months it remains the same."
"Battery at 79"
"Good to be a reconditioned cell phone, I arrived in good condition and it works well. One detail to consider is the battery, which is at maximum capacity of 82% Come with some small scrapes and to put the sim card beatle even though it comes with key."
"It came to me with 83% battery and it’s working well. Physically the phone is super good, it doesn’t have a single detail and I liked it. The box where they send it to you is generic but the important thing is the content. Finally what I didn’t like was that the charger they send you is generic and I’m not really sure how good it is to charge it with less watts than the original charger indicates, I would have liked it at least had the original cable. But from there on out all cool, if I recommend it."
"In general, it was a good purchase! I recommend the right price and I was lucky enough that it arrived with 100% battery. Everything works wonderfully and I didn’t have any problem to configure it, it comes unlocked as the description. The charger fulfills, without being splendid. One by one... Just as the battery came 100%, unfortunately the screen and the back are very scratched. The screen protector that had installed was not very good, so I changed it for a mica of hydrogel. The back had no protection, so I put a mica of hydrogel on it. The scratches are quite visible (I apologize for not showing it well for the mica). For the price and user experience, it seems to me a good purchase and already with micas installed the rayons pass practically unnoticed."
"I got the phone in 2 days. It has like 2 imperceptible bolts, with battery to 87% and works perfect. I recommend the purchase"
"I've only been on the phone for three months, but right now everything's fine, nothing's wrong. I'm very happy with the purchase."
"It came perfect 4 days after ordering it It came with 87% of life, the screen brings glass mica already put intact, without any rayon. It was a good purchase. I recommend the seller (eye, they are not new, they are Rea conditioned and brings generic charger but I have no problem."
"I arrived with minor details in the aesthetics, the battery came in 89% and had no problem. The only detail is that the charger they sent me did not work, from then on it was a very good purchase."
"I arrived in perfect condition with box and charger and battery 94% I highly recommend"
"The cell phone arrived excellent. Without any scratch on the screen, back or bank. It arrived with 100% battery condition and was upgraded to iOS 16 after the first configuration."
"I came literal as new has no scratch or punch, with 100% battery capacity, box and charger that are generic, brought a protective plastic and also came with frost on, I recommend"
"The phone arrived the day I was told, arrived very well packaged and its charger without details , the only detail that I notice is in the lower corner that does not affect in its function, cameras, sound, vibration, the battle true ton, all well so far, the condition of battery reached me 83% nothing bad I hope it will last me at least one charge per day, but satisfied because it arrived me in good condition and with the guarantee that promise of 90 days."
"I bought it because I have more than 5 years passed from iOS to Android and wanted to try without spending so much that such I was going back to the block. As was to be expected the pretty good experience with iOS, intuitive, agile and very well cleaned (not like my Xioami and its very bad interface MIUI full of bugs, which was basically what made me turn back to iPhone). On the other hand this reconditioned iPhone came with an almost perfect aesthetic, only a scratch on the screen that was not very visible to the naked eye. The big problem was the maximum battery capacity, as a sample in the photos of 77%, and in the specifications of Amazon renewed says it should be a minimum of 80%. Besides that personally I feel that the touch was left to duty, I felt that I had a lag. I ended up making the return for the theme of the stack and touch, zero problems and excellent attention from the salesman TELMOV. I recommend it: Yes, but I still look for a renewed the recent ones, I hope they will serve my review and photos."
"Slightly scraped but just as promised"
"aesthetic 10 of 10, the battery at 95%, the price is what I liked the most ;)"
"The product came with what it promises, a simple packaging, with warranty, charger and cable type Lightning and of course the iPhone, which is without a single scratch, has all the functions and specifications chosen, Face ID, True Tone, unlocked for any company and with a good quality protective mica. Happy with the purchase, I would do it again."
"Wonderfully everything, the charger was generic, but from there I liked everything."
"It's the first time I buy a renewed iPhone. An aesthetic of 8.5 could say... it has no scratches on the back or on the banks but it does on almost the whole screen, like 3 that do notice a little and the others see them when you look at them in detail but with a mica of hydrogel no longer noticed, I found the first defect in the charger, it turns out that the cube no longer worked from the first attempt to charge it, and finally the battery that reached me with an 88%, I arrive on Monday 29 November and today 2 December the battery low to 87%... maybe it was already going to come down but I will have it in observation and take care of the battery, if it comes down more in a short time I think I will return it."
"Very good item, good price, only the battery life is at 80%."
"The product is practically good, I arrived 2 days ago and it works without problem, I arrive with 85% battery. It should be noted that if it came a bit scraped from the corners and from the back it has marks from a cover that cannot be removed, and from the 2 speakers from the bottom it only works 1, it was to be expected because the product is not new, but it does not affect its functioning, even so it continues to be heard well, as for the rest it works perfect Face ID to 100 and all the cameras of the same way, as for the battery it lasts me approximately 8hrs of normal use. In conclusion I have read other comments and it is a coin to the air to buy this, so much it can be good or bad, question of luck, in my case I like the product and if I think to keep it until the moment it works well, update the review if something goes wrong afterwards, recommend to buy it only if you are not so demanding and do not have the resources to buy it, if you have 1000 times better to buy it again."
"The phone came aesthetically new, because of the exception of the scratched screen and with a mica to balance it, however when I lit it the person for whom it was (it was a gift) realized that in the upper right corner had a very noticeable stain of humidity which should not happen if the cell phone has IP68; I checked it and it had already been opened. It had no residue of glue on the back cover, on edges. We thought someone bought it again, changed the screen for his that was damaged and returned it, entering as renewed. I do not understand how Amazon sells those orders ""revised by its quality technicians"" but well, it returned only for that. In itself the cell phone was a 9 without that detail that was very noticeable."
"The phone is in perfect condition. I received it with battery capacity to 86%"
"The product looks new, 100% battery and with warranty on the mobile until the following year.Excellent product, I would buy again with the seller."
"The only thing I don't like is that the battery goes down fast."
"Everything as advertised the cell phone came looking almost new in very good condition"
"When I got my cell phone I was super happy because I got spotless, without scratches, nor blows, the battery came to me with 96% practicing as new, however it did not come complete since I did not bring the tray of the SIM card, while I can not use the cell phone completely since I can not put Sim in what I get the tray:("
"It's pretty good the only bad thing that's got two little scratches of everything else is pretty good."
"The cell phone came with a generic charger and cable. The aesthetic is 9/10, with minimal usage marks. I took the computer to an Apple Store for a comprehensive diagnosis and it was only alerted in 2 components which specified that they could be solved with the iOS update. Bateria to 86% of service life after about 800 load cycles. For a ""renewed"" or use computer, I think it is acceptable and functional.As I test it, I will update if anything changes."
"The product arrived in good condition, minimal blows but they do not prevent the functionality of the product.I arrive with a battery of 86%."
"The only thing I didn't like was that it got with the battery to 86, it's within the expected range but I expected to be lucky. After using it a few months it went down very fast to 75 :("
"Quality and price"
"Battery at 83%, screen with 3 small scratches, everything else works well so far."
"It is in excellent condition but it came to me with C-type charger when the one that the iPhones need is inning Lightning"
"I didn't like that a bosin came out of the bottom and the others were heard very ugly, but don't return it because I already needed it."
"I got good at aesthetics, only when we learned it arrived with 80% battery of the equipment, for in iphone that percentage of life is very little, more related to the price."
"A good gift for my son"
"It's very good and it didn't scratch me or anything."
"First find out exactly which seller of all available was the one that had the best reviews in the last months and days, then determine that the best was BuySpry. The phone came to me impeccable, battery to 100%, without aesthetic details, without problems like the unrecognized screen, lock by iCloud or recognition of the Sim, although it was not an original box evidently, still and so the box was of good quality, comes a generic charger and a usb cable to Lightning, besides that already the cell phone comes with a crystal mica (only I had to buy it a case, transparent and ready)I am very satisfied with this cell phone in fact is my first iPhone, I wanted to give it a chance since I acquired an iPad in December and I really liked its system, that same made me acquire some AirPods 3, and integration is at another level, there is really nothing in Android that can be compared to the IOS ecosystem.Totally recommended if you doubt that an iPhone 11 despite stopping your years is still a good team for the processor and the cameras maintains a good price-quality ratio thanks to entering as a renewed product."
"Everything in order, battery, screen, operation, the only detail was that the vocina was dirty.It was taken to maintenance so that it was heard well."
"It arrived on time and of good quality, arrived in generic box, with generic charger."
"It is in exelent conditions of 10 reasonable price within the market"
"Good price ratio quality"
"Very small details, it came with mica and surprisingly with 100% battery"
"Very good product."
"good item for the at&T line but not compatible for megamobile, excellent care and good attention, I recommend it to not spend too much on expensive systems. the battery lasts a lot"
"The charger didn't work,"
"As it appears in the photos and description 100%"
"The media could not be loaded. The seller was “BuySPRY”, the iphone came to me in very good condition aesthetically speaking of the back side along with the corners, however the PANTALLA WAS ALL RALLED. The cell phone came with a glass mica already put, to throw away the rallions, but in the same way it was quite noticeable, and I was afraid to take them away by another review that I read where the screen was worse than mine, so I decided to start the process of return (although I am going to buy it back here in Amazon because it is at a reasonable nut price but from another seller). In addition the iphone arrived with an 80% percentage of battery, I used it for three days and low to 79%, the stack I was hard about 10 hours of constant use on social networks. Outside the screen and the stack, everything worked excellent, on the other hand they gave me a generic fast loader that charged faster than my original apple charger."

"High-end and well-functioning phone"
"The cell phone very well with a few scratches on the screen that were barely visible, what I dislike was the health of the battery as it came in 78%."
"The battery came with 94% and it works perfectly. I recommend the purchase."
"I got there earlier than expected., to 100 battery health.,no scratches or marks.. practically as new and functional in everything,faceid,cameras.,speaker.. Horns etc. .. very satisfied with the purchase I was very lucky I considered that I got a new team .."
"In the description they guarantee that the equipment has a battery capacity greater than 80%, since this one that I have bought has 75%, less good that you can return it. At the reception of a rayon on the screen the aesthetics of the cell phone and other characteristics are perfect seemed new with the simple aesthetics to the"
"To be reconditioned this super battery at 89%, arrived me long before the estimated date and the product zero scratches, totally satisfied with the purchase, quality price totally fair."
"The device came as new. Excellent presentation. Good extra details such as charger, cable and screen protective mica."
"Really a new team even if it's reconditioned."
"It came to me long before it was specific and very well packed. It has small bolts of use, which is normal on a renovated phone, but it works well, already connect my smartwatch and Soundpeats brand bluetooth headphones and work perfectly. I had a detail with the initial update of the apps, but with a full phone reset was enough and so far it is working great. I will update the review in about 3 months."
"The cell phone came to me with 81% battery, which means that in a short time of use it will be necessary to make an urgent battery change (This to avoid the sudden battery basses using the computer) For example, use the computer one day and 26% battery step to 10% and then 6% and it went out.The computer also overheated repeatedly, the screen came scratched.I think for the price is not worth it."
"Everything has charmed me of this iPhone 11 yellow! It arrived on time, good product, had a scratch but small but nothing that affected the operation and practically invisible with the mica, the stack at 85% but it is not new so without complaints and I have already been with cell phone several months and I am still fascinated with the purchase, seller verified, checked and the sure thing is that I will continue to buy with him or her :)"
"I'm having trouble with the purchases in love as it is that they announce it completely unscrambled and it's locked in the window of my taster so I can unblock it and it's going to cost me a thousand pounds."
"I arrive without any details, with 100% battery, a very good phone"
"buy this product for the price and for the same reason I did not expect more, it has some aesthetic details but are not visible to the naked eye and the battery comes below 80%"
"It came very well, a small scrape in a corner but hardly seen and also came with a glass mica, the stack at 85% very well, camera, facial lock, can be used with any cell company, very good purchase I recommend"
"The phone arrived in very good conditionThe stack is at 87%, they changed the screen completely and in the settings section does not recognize it as original productBut the phone pulls to perfection, comes without scratches, super careful"
"It arrived on time, very carefully, without scratches, the battery with more than 80%. Only with a small detail on the button deactivate/activate doorbell but otherwise it works at 100."
"According to the model I bought, the price seemed very good, the equipment arrived in perfect condition, with the battery at 100%, it has not failed almost 1 week, everything works well, I could link it without problem with my Apple Watch , brings a generic charger and cable as indicated in the description as well as a box not original, but it comes well packaged, I think it is a matter of luck, I risk myself and receive a product 98% new"
"The package arrived in time, very well packed, brings its charger and generic cable that work properly, the phone arrived without marks, blows or scratches on the back, edges and lenses of the cameras, the stack condition is 89%, works without problems, Face ID correct, True Tone correct, cameras work well, sound and vibration also work, this unlocked, the buttons in good condition, the only detail is that it has several scratches on the screen, that go beyond the normal wear of a computer and if they are visible to a arm of distance, it is put a mica and practically not seen, except one in the center of the screen, I decided to keep it, thinking that when changing it can arrive another with more details.And besides I was made up the equipment, however it is to take into account that the equipment if they have details of use and are visible, give more the impression of being used to be reconditioned, the products are expected to have signs of use but not with signs of abuse, I consider that Amazon should improve the quality control of its suppliers in these products"
"Everything went well fast delivery before time well packed and well product"
"The product arrived and comes as mentioned with a stack percentage of 80, and some aesthetic details, I'll be waiting for some detail, for now all good"
"It has a 9/10 aesthetic (it has very slight scratches that do not affect the operation of the phone) although the battery arrived with an 86% battery condition I would have liked it to arrive with more."
"Like many I had my doubts about whether to buy the equipment or not.My first impressions of the aesthetics of the phone is a 7/10, it has 2 details on the screen, it does not affect the performance, but as in the purchases that I saw them cover them with a glass mica.In addition to this it has details on the edges, which are acceptable since it is a renewed computer.In question the percentage of battery reached me with 83%.In operation it fulfills very well, Apps, download, signal, video, sound etc.Another good point is that the computer is released.I will be updating based on my experience since although 83% is regular, I will continue to give it a normal use, I hope not to have to return it, but everything can happen."
"For the price is fine, although I would have liked a little more percentage of battery life"
"In general it fulfills what it says, although a lens came starry"
"Being refurbished teams you can be lucky or not. In my case a camera does not work and I have been trying to contact the team for more than a week to make the warranty valid. I bought from Amazon thinking that it would be easier the process (if required) but it is not. Keep in mind."
"Excellent condition of the cell phone and battery was in incredible condition, I know it is restored only because so mentions the article. The quality of the product was very good."
"The phone comes very well from aesthetics, the stack comes to 85 percent, which I expected to be used but came damaged from the horn, does not work, neither listen or listen to me when talking!"
"I arrive in very good condition and it works perfectly, the only bad thing is that the pile arrived with a 73% load capacity. When I finish the warranty of the phone, I will change it. It is still a good purchase, but not excellent."
"The phone brings a tempered glass, which hides the screen that is totally scratched, arrived with 85 percent battery life, out of that all excellent"
"It arrived on time, super well packed, in perfect condition, I have been with him for about a week. It came with 81% battery, that would definitely be the only bad thing, however the phone works perfectly."
"The team came very well protected and the battery is above 95%, of aesthetics is 10."
"I bought it for my daughter, I'm on time and a year later a super cell phone."
"All very well the product and the price charm us"
"I was very afraid to buy a reconditioned phone, I had checked the iPhones for some time and read all the reviews and I saw all the photos, fearful and everything I decided to buy and I didn’t know what a good decision, it came in a generic box, I turned it on and the first thing I checked was the stack I couldn’t believe when I saw it bring it to 100, the scratched zero screen, everything working at 100. The only thing that scared me was that at first I didn’t download anything from the store app but I restarted it and started pulling super good. It’s really like I bought it as new, everything works super good, camera, flash, bluetooth, microphone, everything, not a single scratch under the mica. It should be taken into account that the same charger is generic but it works very well and everything works perfect for about 5 thousand pesos less (I bought it at 8200) SUPER BUYA"
"It's all right, bring two little scratches, but it's all good."
"After battling with two purchases, the first never arrived (I was refunded to gift card without problem), the second was not functional because when opening it to recondition it and paste it again glued where the SIM enters and it could not be placed (it returned and it was pumped to card) now to occupy that balance I acquired it and it works well, the battery is fine, I arrive in time but, it has enough details, the flash led is broken, has a hit in a corner and presents multiple scratches, unlike other reconditioned items this is the worst in aesthetics but at least I arrive and if it works, I decided to no longer claim because it was a gift and with the cover it is not noticed and at the end what it needed were the functions."
"This product I highly recommend, my phone I bought it 3 months ago and I wanted to write a review after this time, it does not have a fly skating and the system is excellent the pile came to me of 96% which I found very good for the price and I have no complaint hast the moment"
"It arrived on time and in good condition, it only has a small scrape on the bottom. Battery health at 90% and works well in all respects. The charger dice did not work, but the cable did, although it was not really a problem for me."
"Buying a cell phone of this type is always a lottery, you don't know if you will get a good one or something that isn't worth it. In my case my cell phone arrived in perfect condition and after 3 weeks of use I have no complaint in any sense. The only thing is that it reached me with 85% battery life but it is above the minimum that must reach you (80). Anyway the duration of the stack yields well."
"I bought it in May, today in November I skipped notification that my battery needs maintenance. It arrived with 90% and now has 75%. If I noticed it took longer to charge but I thought it was my charger. Save a thousand more pesos and buy a new one with guarantee! the change of battery comes almost double"
"The battery condition was lower than I expected. It reached me at 83%"
"It is the product that promises, it has 88% battery life, loq eu seems acceptable to me for the price that was less than 10,000. It does not have scratches nor looks very used, it would give a 9.5 to the aesthetics of the casing and to the screen a 10, certainly. I do not put 5 stars because my line is Mexican with BAIT (part of Altán Redes) and it was not compatible, so I had to switch to another one with less Gigas of data a month. Anyway, it was not much difference to be able to use an iPhone 11. Similarly they billed without problems."
"The cell phone arrived in good condition, has several very light screen markings, the battery at 85%, the charger is generic but works perfect all the equipment."
"It came in good condition and even came with a mica. the only flaw I have noticed after a week almost two of use is that I feel the microphone is very “sensitive” the audios or calls I get to make, it seems that I am speaking very loudly or at a moderate tone when I am even whispering.outside that, everything very well"
"The phone impeccable, as new, so far excellent, I have with him a month."
"Thanks to the company Amazon for supporting the suppliers of refurbished equipment. For me it is a guarantee that Amazon supports them. The team came as new."
"I've been doing a little bit more of the month with the iPhone and my opinion after is the use is that it arrived in good condition, aesthetically 9.5, it has some light scratches on the screen and on the back of the cover, but still it's nothing serious or that it's noticed too much. In matter of the battery came with 91% condition so it's not bad, in the time I've been with the whole it has worked and I haven't had any problem , Face ID, calls and messages, cameras, battery, it doesn't have generic screen so check, GPS, BT , all right, all I would comment is that it's NOT TOTALLY DISLOQUEED FROM COMPANY as it says, I used my phone company Bait and when I inserted the SIM didn't read it, until I tried Telcel and Movistar worked, I had to change company to make use of the Cellular that for me it wasn't a big problem, but it says why at least the time I was not for any company."
"Everything is perfect, only the speaker doesn't work, I get a bad experience about that type of purchase, probably won't repeat it :( Trust too much on Amazon :("
"I arrived without details I reached 10/10 and the battery at 87% the truth for the year that is the cell was made very well the truth 100% recommended"
"If it wasn't for the battery that comes to 80%, it would be perfect."
"Battery at 85%, so far has not presented any faults and works at 100, only the camera does not have such a good definition but that I think is the model itself."
"The equipment was received very well packaged and protected, it is practically new only minimal details in the frame of the cameras, (see photo attached). I will update them in terms of functionality a few more weeks, as I barely received it yesterday and today activated it."
"The product has scratches on the screen that are seen 3 arms away (not 1 as described), the cleaning in the horn to listen, it seems that it is dirty and I have had some problems with the WiFi of the equipment (suddenly it loses the signal and no longer connects).On the back it is impeccable, as in the contours.The capacity of the battery, is at 84% (already low and soon it will require the change).The charger and the generic cable, work well.I will continue to test the theme of the WiFi and if it fails, I will have to return it."
"The good: arrived in less than 24 hours.The excellent: the overall physical state of the equipment, looks new.Lo No Tan Bueno (bad): Battery health at 85% and charger and cable of dubious quality, I doubt they are MFI."
"The truth was that I hesitated a lot to buy a mobile phone Reaccomanded by the multiple reviews with bad experiences; even as it has been said, when making a purchase of this style is a risky move. However, I have been absolutely satisfied with the purchase and extremely grateful to the seller.The phone arrived in one day.The aesthetic conditions are truly impressive since it shows only minimal aesthetic details that only when you look at it carefully have to be noticed.It really seems totally new, as it arrived with 88% battery condition.It was perfectly packed and even with plastics to protect the phone; it even comes with tempered glass protection mica on the screen.I can tell you that they have been one of the best purchases I have made and I must reiterate I am extremely grateful to the seller for such excellent shopping experience.Now it is only necessary to see if in the next few weeks it presents any flaws so I will be updating this review as I am using it."
"The price looks good, but it isn't, you can find better phones in sales groups, mix up or on facebook, the cost is high, they have little warranty time, in my case the screen came very scratched, some very deep.The battery comes very well, with 93% maximum capacity.It's not bad at all, it's lucky as the teams come out of Amazon wineries (ask yourself) you might touch a great one or not, I don't think it's worth the risk."
"All very well with the product, my only complaint is with the shipment they promised me a date and I arrived three days later, but everything else to 100"
"The phone arrived without any scratch on the screen or on the rear glass, came with 95% battery.The only thing we didn't like was that the cables and adapter are generic, they are not original."
"I already have a couple of months with the phone and it’s literally 100. It came with 100% battery life, packed as if it were new and with generic charger (the latter was broken down to the month which is understandable). Aesthetically it’s 9.8/10 for a small detail in the corner that is honestly imperceptible. If you’re still undecided if you buy a reconditioning, this is the comment you expected."
"The phone arrived well taken care, unlocked, the battery 86% 128gb, face id, cameras, without scratches, almost new. I had to return it because the majority of screens of iPhones 11 come out defective, have that yellowish color that does not remove the true tone or the night shift, not even changing the shade of colors, I am not the only one I see that happens also with the newest, iPhone 12 pro, max and mini also, being totally new!. I research and are many users who detect this problem and return them to the Apple itself, in short they have diminished their quality control the iPhones, being still new, their screens come out defective, not all some screens if they come out with real colors, I have another iPhone that I have older and looks much better their screen than the 11 being original, check reviews and videos and there are many tests that this screen defect is of manufacture, even the screens of the iPhones 7,6,5 look better. There are X and XS that have compared real screens than the most new ones but it is practical iPad and in you see good luck."
"It arrived in excellent condition, only a small scrape on the bottom that is not noticeable. It works wonderfully."
"The team arrived at me in time and manner as corresponding. The detail is that I got with failure in the battery. I hope the supplier will give me the guarantee of the equipment"
"RECOGNIZING BUYSPRY as it answered me super fast my doubts before buying, the equipment as it describes it. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUYSPRY!!! Soon I will buy you other iPhone"
"At first I had many doubts about buying this phone or not. I saw some bad reviews towards this one and they put me in doubt. However, I bought it and the next day they had already delivered it to me. Among the first thing I wanted to see was the battery since many mentioned that it came from 80 to 90 of capacity and the phone that came to me brings it 100%.As for the aesthetics I give it a 8/10, since it has some details in the top and bottom but nothing that bothers me (at least to me) and in the back you see only a few scratches, nothing to worry about.I am satisfied with the purchase.I will be testing it for several months and if I detected something rare I will publish it.Pd. The face ID pulls well, the same camera and in the few hours that I am in use has not been stuck to me.Update: I have two weeks of use and the phone has behaved to perfection.The battery lasts a day and a half with moderate use (only I use social networks and occasionally when I see some video).I also have had to the charge I think it is fine. I put it when it is between 15% and 20% and usually I am doing it."
"The product arrived very fast, well packaged, I did not find the key for sim, came with charger and cable (generic but functional) however after loading the equipment and proving it in the day I noticed a defect on the screen and had to return it, the price seemed acceptable to me, I had already bought this type of equipment ""refurbished"" and had no problems, I hope to find another equipment."
"I decided to return it and order a new one, came very scratched the screen, apparently it is lucky that you touch one in good condition."
"For in the camera appear some Manchitas and fails to connect to the network after being several hours in the wifi of the others Everything very well"
"I liked the equipment, it is in very good condition only has a very slight hit on a corner and is somewhat scratched the screen but passes unnoticed. I put a 4 because it reached me with 87% condition on battery which I would have liked to be better worse equal is an acceptable performance. If I recommend the purchase"
"The screen has small size the stack has 86%The call horn is heard very wellThe speaker if you raise it a lot like it wants to distort but I don't know distort, whatever the guarantee is, it hurts a gift and it charms it"
"Everything was fine but I had a big, deep rayon on the screen that didn't come in the description."
"The article had good aesthetics, but when trying to update it we had problems, we could not activate facetime or imessage, but the main problem is that the battery came deteriorated since its condition was 75% so the same equipment marked that it was damaged, for this reason I decided to return the product"
"If I like, phone quality fair price"
"Just what I expected, aesthetically the rating is 9 as it brought a slight dent in the charger jack and light scratches on the back of the glass, out of it excellent. Now with the theme of battery life, the minimum that Amazon assures for its products is 80%, in my case I arrive with 81% so it enters that range, I would prefer longer battery life and is the reason why I put 4 stars. It is my first purchase of renewed equipment and if I remember it, moreover, if it is not what you expected you can return the team."
"The team came to me quickly and in a very well-kept appearance, zero scratches. The capacity of the stack if I arrive less than 85% but all right."
"I got the iphone 11 out of 64 gb Just that the earphone and a horn were damaged. I had to apply for a refund."
"The team arrived with a battery capacity of 99% which I was quite surprised, but it came very grated from the screen (this does not affect the operation) but I think that if you have to consider it when making the purchase, otherwise it had no details and so far it is working very well, the purple color is beautiful and even though it is grated I am very happy with my purchase, if I recommend it."
"Aesthetically very well, but when you take a photo and use it in zoom, a black stain appears on the screen and photos."
"The phone came in a state 9/10 with battery to 82%, excellent buy, until now very good buy, we will see in time update them."
"You can't demand much for the price, but at least I don't get it with flaws or so much aesthetic damage."
"The phone came in with bluetooth problem (it doesn't connect), I wanted to return it but I couldn't because I didn't bill it (I ALWAYS FACTUREN), the screen was damaged, the camera followed (I never dropped it)A shame that they sell that kind of quality"
"I've been using it for almost a month and so far it works perfectly!"
"Estetically this beautiful came with 81% stack but oh surprise when calling you don't listen :( and when playing music it sounds horrible like the horns were thundered"
"Hello!! There was no key for the SIM. The screen comes scratched but everything else seems to work well."
"It's a shame they sell a product with 79% battery level."
"If you're going to buy a refurbished product don't expect a perfect team.The seller offers a semi-new product.I loved my purchase, it's really what I expected, good value for money."
"It's no use, face id. You should mention it."
"Aesthetic 10/10, battery had 86% (it is within the acceptable) I have a week with it and without problems, I recommend it (it comes with Mica on the screen)"
"I arrived in very good condition and fast, I have been with him for a month and no faults"
"I received the product in excellent condition, in a generic box. Everything works perfectly. It has a small scrape in the housing, but it is almost imperceptible. Battery life is at 85%."
"I like quality price"
"Good team is my first iPhone I arrived in very good condition I have been using it 2 months without any problem The pile I got with 88 I have no problem I late all day full"
"It is delivered with what the description says, however it has more aesthetic details than is mentioned in the publication. It is fully functional."
"Just the detail on the screen, it has a mark on the glass, ok operation"
"I like that it never fails, everything works very well"
"The team arrived in time, it came with its generic charger as it indicates, at first glance it looks like new, it has no blows on the edges or anything, light scratch on the screen but only if you pay a lot of attention, the battery is at 84%, the camera well and the horn also, for the moment everything seems good, considerable price and at least super well, the team I like very much and I do not hesitate to continue putting it to the test."
"Practically new, without any scratch, came to me with 100% battery, cheer up!!"
"Good experience in general. It arrived earlier than estimated and the phone looks very good, with scratches almost imperceptible but with very good functioning. That yes, charger and generic box and battery at 86% performance, as indicated in the description. However it is an excellent option to enjoy an iPhone at a much lower price, contributing to decrease the technological waste by giving these products a second chance."
"I've come very well, it looks new and everything works at 100."
"The team is at 90% physically but what I do not like is that the battery came to 75% very degraded, the earpiece to listen is heard low, the others it looks good, hopefully not present any fault later. greetings."
"I got very fast the battery reached 85% also grated lego from the back but it is not visible to the naked eye as they left it indicated and came with some marks on the sides but for its price is fine"
"The truth I am very satisfied aesthetic 9.9 just a few microscopic scrapes around the lens of a literal camera neither can be noticed nor affected in anything the battery reached 92% I have been 1 month with the equipment and I feel satisfied with the purchase. Recommended. Obviously the charger and accessories are generic but it is worth investing separately to an original charger to not damage the equipment"
"I get there fast, with a hit on the top, until now it hasn't failed."
"I bought it in the hot comes out so it came out very cheap, but it came in with 88% stack that quickly low to 87 since it was lower than above, I would have liked to have the luck of one of +95 stack"
"Biene very good packaged obviously does not include original accessories all generic and as far as aesthetics of the device only arrive with some damage to the part of the camera are slight but if they are noticeable"
"I arrive without any aesthetic detail, battery at 80%, one of the two speakers is not heard but the audio is excellent"
"It came impeccable, without a scratch and everything perfect, the detail is that when I entered configuration I came up with a non-original screen warning, which means that they changed it, for now it works as if it were original, the other aspect with which I did not feel completely happy was that the battery came to 82%, it is within what was agreed yet other users reached 90-100. This review is with two weeks of use."
"It works very well I already have a time with it and without any problem"
"The product came to me well and in perfect condition, the stack is at 80% of its useful life, I have been almost half a year and I have not had problems, nor stack, nor with iOS updates."
"I already tried it and apparently everything is in operation, only with the detail that reached 85% of battery capacity, but ps occupied a phone."
"It arrived in a generic box, but well protected. Checking it thoroughly has no detail, it looks like new. The only thing, it came to me with 83% battery life, but it works excellent; there are times that I disconnect it in the early morning, I use it since morning and when I return home in the evening, it still has 60%, also depends on its use, since watching multimedia content lasts about 12 hoursIt was purchased at Westend Enterprises Inc. the service was excellent, they solved all my doubts and even billed it!"
"The iPhone came in very good condition, with the accessories mentioned but expected a better state of the battery (it came with 80%) came without scratches and well wrapped :)"
"I had my doubts when buying a ""reconditioned"" device for some comments, but in this case the cell phone came to me in excellent condition. If you have small details like that the battery is at 99% and in my case I had some very small lines in the glass that you barely see (that with a cover those mothers do not see). But in everything else the device feels like new and the price I am completely satisfied."
"The phone when I received it was the emotion of my life, aesthetic was almost 100 (small blows from above) but as soon as I started to use it came disappointment, I did restore all my information and I passed it from my other iPhone to this one and the phone started to warm horrible and as I continued to use the phone it kept heating up, I put it to charge and it took 3 hours when my other cell was charging in total in 1 being dead, and when I started to use it under super fast the pile and likewise if I used it continuously it would warm up :( I was afraid to buy reconditioned by topics like this, I thought it would be the exception but I see that I am not :c very disappointed, I will try to use it one week but if it continues like this I will change it because it is a phone that I will not be able to use in the day"
"I get extremely scratched from the screen, even it would seem a little cramped"
"Good iPhone, I arrived in my case a few days ahead of schedule, the equipment comes with battery to 84%, a small rayon on the bezel and some deep scratches on the screen (disguise with the mica), that's what I found not so good, in the good things, wow, it's an iPhone, everything else extremely functional and normal without any problem, if I recommend to buy for the price at which I got it, I suggest to stay pending with the price variations and look for the lowest, would give an 8.5 to the transaction in general"
"Hello, the cell phone came with aesthetics of 10, but, the speakers were heard as blown apart that it came with performance of 73% because the specifications said that they came above 80%."
"The battery life was very low."
"It all came in good shape and it works perfect."
"I like and fulfill, I will not return good product"
"It arrived in very good condition, without scratches or anything, that if the charger is not original one must be bought. It brought 85% battery"
"I arrive in perfect condition, aesthetic of 10 only with a small rayon in a corner which I noticed days later, the condition of battery is at 88%, very satisfied"
"It came to me with 80% battery; the aesthetic is very good although it has details. It is well phone for the price paid"
"The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, looks new, I got 85% battery, all good so far"
"Being a reconditioned phone arrived in very good condition, battery with more than 90%, charger and generic cable.You can only see a small hit on one of the edges, if you see it carefully.In general it is in perfect condition."
"the condition of the battery is at 76% however aesthetically it is in good condition as well as it is working correctly"
"The iPhone did not have a single scratch on the back or front, it came with a percentage of 83% in battery, it only had a small visible detail around the charger input but nothing of importance, what I realized days later was that one of its speakers did not work, but still has excellent volume and audio quality"
"Although it is in very good condition, the supplier did not corroborate that the cell phone operation was in perfect condition. The volume of the headset is very low (I think this was a manufacturing defect in the first iPhone 11). But it should have been mentioned in the sales announcement. Otherwise theProduct is well and the delivery was fast and safe. Faced with my complaint the seller agreed to return it product but I decided to keep the Cell phone despite this defect."
"Very low battery condition percentage"
"Good product. Aesthetic 9/10, came with 2 scratches on the side, but the rest of the equipment is impeccable. Battery condition 87%. Everything works fine. Yes I would buy it again. I suggest that they buy products from the United States, give them better care than in Mexico. Better even if they can/have look for “Premium Conditioned”, it comes out more expensive but it is practically a new phone."
"I arrived in a very good condition and with battery at 85%"
"It works well with 86 drums but if I came with some scratches both on the screen and in the back, it came intact from the corners and the horns are heard well the scratches are dissimulated with real crystal micas with mica they do not notice anything when his mobile Rea conditioned come with micas remove them to verify that it is in good condition since they really do not notice anything with them"
"The Serbian is excellent."
"I've been with him for a month and he hasn't let me down."
"The product itself looks very little used, it came to me with 99% of the battery status, the 256gb that I asked for, so far it has worked normally, the only detail that I noticed was that when I saw another iPhone 11 of a friend (which was acquired new), I felt it with more quality on the screen, very probably the one that I was given had a generic screen, it does not look bad, but I have to admit that the feeling of the screen quality of the other iPhone pleased me much more..."
"Price is good according to equipment"
"Not because it's not what they're offering."
"I didn't like it coming with 84% battery."
"It is not recommended if you are looking for a phone in good condition although if it is to replace one already used this well, it arrived fast but does not work the charger and apparently had a lock that did not allow to download applications"
"The speakers didn't listen well, they listened awfully, and the battery came to me with 84% (something good)"
"I had my doubts about buying a refurbished product, but take the risk and be quite satisfied! I got with the stack at 95% and no scratches on the screen. If I had some small scrapes at the bottom where it was loaded but they did not look at the naked eye. The charger has the Certificate and works quite well, although I chose to buy its original charger. In conclusion, I recommend them quite for the price you pay, and with Amazon you have the warranty of 90 days before any failure or not being satisfied! I have been using it approximately and until now all right, I would return to buy it without problems or at least take into account this option when I want to change my cell phone! It is worth cheering for the warranty they give,"
"The phone reached me without any scratches on the screen or on the back, battery life at 89%. So far it has not presented faults"
"The display I was coming with was very generic, terrible quality, from there on out the cell phone has no fault."
"Good device the only detail is a small rayon on the screen but with the mica it is not even noticed, the battery was at 81% health and in less than a week low to 80% of there outside the device works correctly, I hope the battery will stay at that percentage of life for a good while in case of some detail I will update my review."
"Aesthetically it has its obvious details not new but here the moment works well I hope it lasts a long time like this"
"Cell came super well with the stack at over 90% I've been with it and it's still super good, highly recommended seller"
"The product is good, despite the reviews if you receive a phone with up to 95% battery. However the phone was damaged in the process, so you have to be on the slope of the state."
"The impeccable phone as well described, generic but new accessories and work well."
"I just acquired this equipment because I already needed to change my cell after 6 years. The battery as such mentioned is more than 80% the back came with some taps and scratches probably was used for a while without protection and was hit between keys or coins. In the end it works well and I hope I will last another couple of years, in case some other detail comes out I will update this window, I consider that it was a good purchase for the price and capacity of 128gb memory."
"I liked the excellent condition he was in, the percentage of batteries and the well-protected package."
"Very good product, the stack at 80%, aesthetic 90% is what the description says and it is fulfilled, very happy with the purchase, I doubted very much but when everything came change the truth better than I expected I would buy again equipment of this type."
"The only bad thing is that it has a malfunction at the top of the screen and does not let use that part of the screen. From there on out I really like the color, the camera, the size and it is very functional."
"The battery capacity is 100% and everything works perfectly"
"It arrived with the screen very scratched and battery to 81% I do not know how having a supposed quality control Amazon allow this"

"I come in quick and in the new box. I seem to have bought it in an official place."
"The product is like new"
"The equipment works perfectly, the battery lasts as expected and this as new, is fast and perfect for my commercial work"
"Excellent in every way"
"Fully pleased with the phone. 100% satisfied. Everything works perfectly and the computer looks completely new."
"Great."
"THE CARGER IS NOT COMPATIBILE WITH THE CELLULAR IS ARRIVED"
"I asked for the product in a beautiful abort and it wasn't like I asked for it, second the cable or charger didn't serve and I had to buy a new one., please need the code of this cell phone to compare with mine and be sure that it is my cell phone that amozon command"
"First time I bought a renovated equipment. I didn’t know what to expect. In Apple it turns out that the RENEWED PREMIUM equipment is better and have a longer warranty than the No Premium. This phone I bought came in a white box with green AMAZON and inside a generic cable and charger. When removing the plastic protection from the phone, my surprise was to find a PRACTICALLY NEW equipment. No punch or brand of other type. The only thing I found (and because I was looking for something) a tiny scratch on the screen next to the frame. Surface strip of about two millimeters... The battery is 91% and when I turned it on immediately the operating system to IOS 16.1.2 TODO, everything works very well. I don’t notice the difference between a new equipment and this one. Definitely, it’s an excellent investment and decision to go for this equipment."
"Excellent purchase, it's my first time buying re-conditioning and I must admit it was an excellent purchase came to me almost impeccable and with 98% battery. Without a doubt it is a good option"
"All good is a premium product meets expectations the only bad thing is that it says in specifications that comes with 90% battery but when I checked it it had 85%."
"The equipment is in a condition that almost looks new, only because it has a bit of dirt on the headset but super well cared for"
"the team is ok but in the description it says that at least 90% and mine reached 87%"
"excellent product, in excellent condition, as new, highly recommended"
"I love it."
"Just what I expected! Excellent condition! Color and beauty!! I liked"
"The team came to me with an aesthetic 10 out of 10 practically as new, in matter of the battery I got 100% using it about 20 days and its operation is the right one, the equipment comes released I am using it in AT&T, the only detail is in the charger that is very generic but functional without any doubt I would buy again"
"The team arrived 10/10 seemed completely new, the month of use stopped getting signal, took it to check and was fractured from the card, charged me 200 dls for welding,"

"They are not refurbished cell phones, they are used as they said in another comment. I bought mine in “excellent conditions” but it has scratches and blows at several points of the cell phone. The worst thing is that it came dirty in the headset, speakers and with grease stains on the screen. It is q to say that they did not even bother to clean it, that is why it is not refurbished.

"The phone arrived with very good aesthetics and without scratches and in the requested color. Battery to 90%. It has only been in use for a few days, but there have been no problems. Cable and charger work well, but by quality I guess they won't last long."

"All right, I arrived just the day selected, the stack fortunately stayed 100%, aesthetically has nothing, it seems new. Obviously I arrived in a generic box with generic charger but in case that model stopped bringing charger, I even agreed hahaha, recommended."
"I doubt when I bought it for some reviews I read but I was surprised by the aesthetics that I had, everything works at 100, cameras, speakers, touch, everything Perfect, only for the section of the battery that I reached 88% but still very well."
"I bought this iPhone at a very good price, it has a very good aesthetic, only minimal scratches on the screen, same that I noticed once I changed it the mica I brought. It brought a percentage of stack of 91% The charger and cable with which it comes, although they are generic, loads very fast. For the moment it goes great, I hope I survived. It is beautiful!"
"The price seemed great to me. The equipment comes in very good condition, it has only a very small scratch on the screen but almost not noticed, everything else super well. The battery is at 87%. It works perfect. Super recommended these equipment ratio price and state of it."
"The equipment arrived very well and indicates that the battery has a 100% capacity. Delivery time was good and arrived with a pre-installed mica, cable and charger."
"I don't like that the volume is too low even when you are to the speaker you must see the cell stick to the ear to hear it maybe 40% the volume purchased from another device"
"In my case the phone came in generic box and with generic charger (which is already gain because the phone does not bring it from factory).The condition of my battery is excellent (100%).It has a slight scratch on the top but with a cover is capped."
"I arrive in perfect condition despite being Reaccondido, first team that I buy and without problem."
"I loved the phone, it doesn't bring any physical details, the only thing that displeased me was the battery of only 87%. I recommend it."
"Excellent product, aesthetic and battery"
"The phone came to me with a 100% battery, obviously they replaced it but on the phone it does not mark any warning that this is chafa, so I guess it must be the original. Analyzing the phone consciously using Utools does not send any warning. 100% satisfied with the purchase"
"The phone came with 88% battery would have preferred above 90% but it's fine, it only has 2 details of which only 1 is really visible and with a cover you don't see any, it came something dirty but nothing from the other world, with second hand cables but decent quality, The only setback is that I see 2 scratches on the screen, outside of that excellent."
"Until now I have no problem with the product, I feel that it is new and looks promising, until this moment I give 10/10 to the seller and to the publics as it reached me what I expected"
"I grabbed it like 2 thousand pesos less than it regularly costs. It arrived on time, a couple of scrapes that can be covered with a cover without any problem and 100% battery, a cool one. BuySpry excellent seller."
"Very good product, it is the first time I buy a Renew Product and is in impeccable condition"
"Equipment without aesthetic details, only the battery performance is 88%. I would have liked the product review to mention the battery detail."
"It's perfect."
"The battery comes to 96 which for quality price is done very well, and comes with some scratches on the screen but compensates that it brings a mica, everything else works perfect"
"The aesthetic of 10, brought a tiny scratch almost imperceptible around one of the cameras, the battery with 90%, the charger the truth if it looks quite generic and in the same way comes to you in a generic box, I had to return it because the battery was very heated when using certain apps like seeing the stories of IG or charging it (I loaded it with an original fast charge), also the horn was misheard, as if it was “revented” or changed it and it was not the original one, I have another iPhone 12 at home and it does not happen that, so I decided to return it. The advantage of buying reneweds in Amazon is that you have 1 month to prove them and if you are not pleased to return them, but eye, the policies say that in teams Apple the return can take up to 1 month, more than it takes the bank to put the money in your account because they have to review them very well. Take this into account if you are uncertain between a reconditioner or a new one. It is the first time I buy a reconditioned and my experience was not of the good equipment and finally it is a matter of luck."
"The team arrived in good condition with a couple of hits on the corners and scratches on the edges of the cameras (the cameras are in good condition and without scratches on the crystals). The battery with 87% quality, the screen without scratches and all functions operate normally: Horns, microphone, WiFi, Bluetooth, Face Id, etc."
"The cell phone works well, with a generic charger and running smoothly. I only had two scratches in the corner frame and would hit 88%, but the truth by price I can’t complain."
"I was very surprised that the battery will arrive at 99%, the phone does not present many physical details practically a 9 out of 10, in how much to its operation is very good I have been with him for a week and I have not had any problem, I will update later for more details..."
"Not at 100 aesthetic details but price goes by"
"All for description Battery (87%) Estetica (9/10) Cameras, Bluetooth, Wifi, Red (10/10)"
"Very good physical conditions, without significant damage, very light bolts of use. Excellent operation and battery condition at 90%."
"It's a good team in my experience. It's the first time I've bought something reconditioned and so far I haven't had any flaws. I hope I'm still the same."
"The only thing I didn't like and that's with amazon that indexes 90-day warranty of renewed product and a month no longer gives you the option to return it"
"I bought an “acceptable” state iphone, but in very good physical condition (the purchase was with clevercel). Battery with 87% of life, no modified piece, only a few scrapes in the corners (hidden with a cover), and the best 2k less than those that say “excellent state”. I do recommend clevercel."
"I arrive in very good condition, it has a few small almost invisible details. The battery with 94% condition. I am happy for now and I find it a very good option to help the planet and not buy completely new products!! I will use it for a few more days to see how it works but so far I am delighted!"
"Honestly I returned it, because the aesthetic details were visible, they had strong use blows were two, but if they were too worrying because I thought life would have given him then? Everything was original and everything else was fine for the price, otherwise you care about those things I recommend the product."
"I got it at a promotional cost of $13,100 MXN. For that price it is a very good computer that does not ask anything from model 13 and even 14, as the only differences are in the chip, the video and a couple more things like the 6 months of Apple Music. Saving between $5,000 and $8,000 for having almost the same is a big advantage, with that easy you buy Airpods Pro. Outside of that, the quality (in my case) was very high, as the team arrived in excellent condition (as new, without scratches, only with charger and cable) and so far fully functional. I would recommend buying a USB-C cable from Lightning apart to take advantage of the fast charge and a good cover for it to look."
"Excellent conditions, I arrive with 100% of the battery. My best purchase"
"I have a month with the cell phone, so far it has worked very well, I get well careful with some small scratches that are not noticed, the pile is 89%, they have delivered it with charger, cable, I am very satisfied with the purchase"
"I don't know if it was lucky, but it turned out good despite being reconditioned."
"I did a pre-purchase study so the iPhone arrived as all the Reneweds were supposed to arrive, the box in perfect condition and with what was promised. The phone SI has signs so I will give you in aesthetics a 9/10 has 3 ""stitches"" on the frames and a very small scratch on the edge of the camera. The screen has very few scratches, nothing to prevent the use of the screen as well as that the protector makes it look impolute. The battery arrived at 90% and the included charger is functional to no more power, I even wanted to do the first load with a fast Samsung charger and not quizo, solution: use the included generic. The software is fine, the compatibility with the phone (Telcel) to the first, 4G and 5G functional, and all functional connections. In a few words I did a general test that took a day and a half and nothing fault. The battery has no problems, the screen does not work perfectly. I think opening the mind to think that it is a semi-new mobile you realize that it is an excellent purchase and that you saved a very good money."
"I have previously purchased electronic equipment ""refurbished"", ""open-box"", and an Iphone X ""re-accomanded"" 3 years ago that has finally failed and I wanted to replace it with model 12, because for me they represent a great return of value for my money; however I think that they are maliciously perverting the use of the word because the unit I received is simply and plainly used. In the included image you appreciate the damage that the carcass presents, which would be the first thing I hope it will be re-conditioned, but still, when I turn on the computer the system indicates that the battery life is 86%, same that it must be ""re-conditioned""; then I do not understand what they say they guarantee in the re-conditioning, they should simply say unit with two years of use and ready, if anyone buys it knows what to expect. The stars awarded are for the fast attention to shipping, although I can suppose the urgency to get rid of dead inventory. In apple the completely new is only four thousand pesos more, which is what I will do this time: go to the safe with the new one."
"It doesn't come with a charger."
"Although it is true that it has good aesthetics within what fits (because both the loudspeaker above and the microphone and speaker are dirty), it reached me with 88% the life of the battery , behaves well, but with other suppliers it is rare to arrive below 90%, from there on out everything excellent."
"The description of the product was of excellent condition, damages not visible to more than 30 cm and apart, a team supposedly ""renewed"". It came totally beaten, the screen scratched and even raised, as it took off and wanted to ""deceive me"" putting a mica. Terrible experience, it is not worth at all, you are buying a product worse than used, because my current cell phone is 5 years old with me and does not have the amount of blows that it is supposedly renewed. I had already bought by amazon renewed and it was impeccable, but this time super bad experience"
"In general, the equipment is in very good condition.The condition of the battery is 100%, aesthetically it has no detail either on the back or on the sides and everything works perfectly.The only thing that is not in such good condition is the screen, which has some visible scratches and that are deeper than I expected according to the description of the product, but because the rest is in perfect condition it does not bother me.As for the accessories, they are not original; the cable seems good to me but the charger if it seems of poor quality so I did not use it.In addition, the equipment came with a tempered glass installed, which is appreciated.Definitely it seems a very good purchase, with the only detail that the condition of the screen was worse than expected."
"With the device all right so far, only that the cable to charge was bad... I should have been usb a lighting and came to me with a usb a usb type ""c""."
"It exceeded all my expectations, I was very satisfied with my purchase. It came the next day. The iPhone came well packed, with mica on the screen and charger. Only with a few small details on the camera that really do not notice anything. Battery capacity of 93%"
"It is very good offer and the phone is perfect has a very small details but nothing important or that affects, if I recommend it for the price that is much better than a new one"
"I was a little nervous to know how I was going to arrive but to my surprise everything came in order, and with battery condition 100%, I have not failed at anything the iPhone, I highly recommend it"
"I really liked the iphone 12 I bought as it had 92% battery and a 9.8 aesthetic, I recommend the BuySpry seller."
"It arrived soon, it reached me with the stack to 100 works well, only it arrived with some scratches on the screen which do not affect its functioning and are only noticed with the screen off"
"Equipment in very good condition"
"Highly recommended, I understood the renewed Amazon United States and was an excellent purchase, this totally new."
"The state was almost perfect, a small hit on a corner and a minor rayon, branded battery condition at 100%, the system does not mark battery replacement and marks just 12 months of use, the problem is that the battery although it lasts, does not reach the level of a battery to 98% of one use with which I could compare, so it made me suspect that the software was altered.Almost everything works well but some apps are locked or as in the case of Tik Tok, it gets stuck a song from the previous video.I returned it because I did not trust those software random failures.In my case it was the premium version ,Sold and sent by Amazon USA"
"I bought the article but it came blocked by operator :(. I returned the phone and bought it again thinking that it was only bad luck the first time, the second time everything excellent, the iphone is in very good condition and now if it is unlocked."
"Honestly if I have bought enough refurbished products and the great majority have come out very good, but this one took the crown. The iphone came to me with 98% battery, tempered glass mica and Apple Care with validity of 7 months on the day of purchase. I don’t know if all come in those conditions but at least mine if I brought it. Best of all, by buying it in the days of prime day, it cost me 40% less of its original price!"
"Excellent as new and even with mica"
"In the announcement he mentioned that there were two options: good and excellent. Select “excellent”, but the team came with scratches"
"To be a remanufactured equipment, it is in good condition.The screen, without scratches and the operation of hardware and software is fine.Just a few minimal details of aesthetics at the bottom.It arrived well packed.The only problem is that I need invoice and to date the seller has not sent it after several requests."
"Battery life at 99%, aesthetic of 9.5/10, excellent value for money. It does not come with the original charger or cube, but it is generic and functional. I would buy it again completely."
"The phone is sent in perfect condition, working everything, however my team arrived with a deep rayon on the screen (it is understood because the computer is not new)"
"The media could not be loaded. It arrived with 90 percent battery, arrived without any scratch, in fact it looks like a team totally out of store, even came with a Mica included and the generic charger is fast charge, I recommend it very much, I go for a month with it and everything is perfect"
"It came with 90 percent battery, arrived without any scratches, in fact it looks like a team totally out of store, even came with a Mica included and the generic charger is fast charge, I recommend it very much, I am going for a month with it and everything is perfect"
"The product arrived on time and great aesthetics, just a small detail in the aluminum part of the size of the tip of a needle. From there on out as new the stack at 100% no rayon visible on the screen. It comes with very good quality protector I made the mistake of putting one and the quality of the touch under very much so I realized that I had double mica end up removing the other one. Work of the exceptional cameras it should be emphasized that I had the S20FE only strange little the 3x Zoom but it is really used few times. I am very happy with this purchase."
"Very good cell phone, I recommend"
"The team came to me with 100% battery condition and I thought they had changed it but when reviewing the serial it is the same factory, only a few scratches on the screen and the back cover that at first sight do not see you have to see it against light, from there on out the equipment looks new and I am very satisfied with the purchase."
"The team arrived with very few imperfections, some of them on the banks and edges of the camera, what if I didn't like it at all was that even with the ""cleaning"" of experts Amazon could erase the marks of use of the former owner's cover. 87% battery blows and scratches, acceptable since we talked about a used equipment, that if the screen impeccable no damage. only that that it has marks of use of the somewhat loose cleaning cover by parts of the workers.. for a saving of 4500 pesos. well, there are still places like mobilex and smart depot that you find it cheaper."
"The phone came to me in 1 day, I got with the generic box just like the charger, the device physically has only 2 strokes one on the bottom and one near the camera, but it doesn't affect anything to the camera just a little scratch on the edge that covers the camera, physically it's a 9.5 functionally pulls well the life of the battery is 87% there are people who touch them luck and comes out above 90 but well let's hope it doesn't affect its functionality"
"The product tells me that the screen is not original and that it was replaced by a screen that gives no guarantee that the cell phone works properly."
"The product arrived in excellent condition, 0 scratches, 100% battery life and even had a screen protector already installed, it was perfect. The only detail, comes with a very short cable and a power adapter of few watts, it is necessary to buy the accessories if you want to get a better experience but compared to a new and sealed one that also does not come the charger if it is a good saving, I recommend it if you seek not to invest so much in a phone of this range."
"It is the second iPhone 12 that I buy and the first came to me with 89% battery and in aesthetics a 9 and the latter I arrived with 100% battery and aesthetic 10 could practically say that it was new."
"I was encouraged to buy it because I needed to change my previous phone. Reading the comments was that I was convinced, seeing almost as new, slight details of the part of the camera that was dispainted but it is less than 1mm, are only two dots. So in two other areas that being honest just and noticed, with cover you won’t even know that it’s not new. Everything works perfect, 91% battery, very satisfied with the purchase. It comes in a geneticist box with cable “made for iPhone” and a generic cube, besides covered in a movie to avoid scratches on the phone, I don’t regret until now."
"Considering that it is a USADO computer, it is very well battery to 90. Speaking of iPhone 12 network has one side without metal but it is normal for editing"
"It cost me very cheap for the conditions in which it came, practically as new and with 100% battery condition. Everything works excellent, it was a great purchase"
"I arrive with 90% battery life, it has some scratches and aesthetic details but they are not perceived by the naked eye and do not affect performance. It comes perfectly clean and with a mica of tempered glass."
"He runs out of the super fast stack Sometimes he stuck the screen at the beginning The audio sounds horrible if I want to put on speaker or music But the physical aesthetic super gives the catazo"
"Product is not reconstructed as echo design is used charger are not original box not only came the Amazon box came only the phone, check the pile only brought 80% nothing to do with the photos I published brought scratches on the bottom and the display is not smelled as I bought it because it was rebuilt Not used, a little desitado"
"Well I had bad luck, aesthetic 8/10 comes with several scratches and the battery is 88, I'll return it"
"From the best purchase, I had the opportunity to buy it when I was still more BARATO and I do not regret it, the equipment arrived intact, new totally, without any scratch, until the battery 100% could not believe it, I recommend the equipment and the seller. My first purchase renewed and from the best experience"
"The cell phone works very well, it's just small aesthetic details but it doesn't affect the functioning."
"I arrived in perfect condition and already with a mica put on, well packaged in a generic box and with a generic charger, the only one but it arrived with 89% battery condition but it lasts all day with normal use, so far I have 1 month approx with the cell and it works Perfect with telcel and ATT"

"The product arrived with 86 battery, screen in implacable state, no single scratch, surprise"
"He doubts a lot when making the purchase but, I arrive the next day, the pile is 97% alive, and so far I have not had any problems"
"Yesterday it came to me and it goes perfect, it has no aesthetic details and came with mica, the pile came to me with 91%, I will continue to use it to see how it goes but it is very good product, original : ) equal to the image, I recommend"
"The team arrived in very good condition aesthetically, battery to 90%"
"I returned it, because the battery was 86%, I consider it too low to be an Iphone 12."
"I returned it because it couldn't be loaded again, I thought it was the cargo man and I tried to charge him with another cargo man, but he just charged the stuff to get him and there he didn't, eyes had bought another cell renewal and it worked really well, I don't know why this one didn't, because the other was Samsung."
"I was nervous because in the reconditioned cell phone purchases you can get everything and there were no reviews of Mexico, but my cell phone arrived intact!!! As new!! I am really happy with my new cell phone, it is beautiful and has everything I expected"
"Maybe I had bad luck, the cell phone came and worked well, but then at hours of heat, and the screen didn't respond at all well, then after three days, I stopped working the screen, luckily I could return it."
"I like it very much, the color is nice, wine in very good condition and with 100% battery"
"The team arrived on the day when it came to the purchase. The battery life was 100%, which surprised me a lot. A couple of physical details in the frame, but to be renewed this very well. The box and charger could be better, but of the rest there is no complaint."
"Purchased with the seller BuySpry, the phone arrived in good condition, only a lightning bolt on the top of the phone, but already on the screen is not noticed. Everything correct and original; screen, battery, IMEI, serial number, everything in order. The battery came to me with 99%. Good purchase."
"It came to me as the description, in excellent condition and works wonderfully."
"I touched a device with 100% battery health, with almost imperceptible scratches (I didn't notice the scratches when I put mica on it) and it works too well, I went to Apple to run a test and everything went super! It's semi-new and from my highly recommended experience! PD also came with warranty for 3 months at Apple"
"The iPhone arrived in good condition, although as I expected it came with charger and generic box. In matter of aesthetics I give it a 98% and the battery had a 90% life. Overall after almost a month of use, everything very well!!"
"I arrived in time, I got a few scratches but very superficial, of battery I reached 89% with mica, for the price was an excellent purchase, the only but that I would put it is that it comes with generic charger and cable, but from there everything is perfect"

"Miniscule scratches and 95 batteries"
"All perfect, just a tiny scratch on the side."
"The product is very good, it was sent to me without any blow, only a very very slight scratch, not visible to the naked eye. I recommend you to buy the product directly with *Amazon internacional*, since they send you a box with the data that is checked of the equipment and the stack is almost new, and because the main thing, is that 100% sure they send you the phone that you asked for"
"It looked new, the battery at 87%, aesthetically put 10"

"It came to me as if it were new, only the charger and the cable were not suitable for this model."
"The truth I didn’t know what to expect from this product, as not long ago I had a pesima experience buying a renewed iPhone X in Walmart. Fortunately, this iPhone 12 of 64gb I bought is beautiful and works perfectly. The aesthetic is 10/10 and I ran with the luck that the battery condition came to 100%. Undoubtedly one of the best purchases I’ve made."

"It's the first time I've bought a cell like this, and I really recommend it, the battery is 100% without any scratches, just imperceptible marks at first glance. I recommend it."
"I arrive very well, it is practically new, with generic charger and cable. It brings a protective mica for the screen, very light scratches on the front side, nothing significant, very happy with the purchase. It was reviewed all aspects and the battery is also excellent"
"The iPhone is magnificent! Maybe some slight detail in the frame of a camera, but nothing that affects the TOTAL operation. I will buy again! Thank you Amazon!"
"Honestly the team came to me in excellent condition, it has no scratch. It comes as new. I will buy again this way."
"The truth is that if the team comes with visible details, it is obvious price quality but that it comes as new it is very difficult, the functions fulfill them, but the truth if you have the illusion that it comes to you as if it were a new one, it is not so, it is my second purchase and the second time I return it, are details that cannot be overlooked so they are reconditioned equipment, I know, there are good reviews but they are very few, in my experience if you are going to spend if or if more than 10 thousand pesos better save a little more and buy a new one or you can be disappointed or feel cheated."
"The phone has good battery life (98%) and minimal details on the frame but the screen has many scratches"
"Excellent purchase, came to me as new, without aesthetic details, 95% battery condition, protective mica ... really an excellent purchase, starts new charger and Chablé ( generic) I would buy again"

"The equipment that was delivered to me in excellent operating and aesthetic conditions at a super price."
"EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT COMING NEW"
"The phone very nice from the back but the front all scratched as if a child had used the keys to draw on the iPhone screen! Then the seller puts you a mica of protection to simulate that the phone is in good condition! A real trick! I can't believe Amazon lends itself to this type of scam! This phone is not worth that $500 that I was charged!!!!! I wish and Amazon put these fraudulent sellers in place!"
"The equipment arrived well, with box and cable (generic but functional). It has a few slight scrapes that are seen in detail, in operation, so far, perfect"
"Upon receiving the phone (iphone 12) 4 months ago it seemed like an excellent purchase. I am very careful, I have never fallen or wet, this as new, however it stopped working out of nothing. Casually only one month after the warranty period. 16,000 pesos to the trash, the seller simply stopped responding and wash his hands with his 90 day warranty. They are phones ready to last only 4-6 months. Beware!"
"Without a doubt a satisfactory purchase"
"I loved that it arrived Quickly. With a battery status of 97%.. Technically New and at a super price"
"It arrived in excellent condition, battery to %89 screen and back intact."

"Good product. It came to me with 94% stack and in good condition"
"The day an app used it I tracked the iphone, and I had to force it off. It didn’t happen again until a week later, it warmed up, stuck and went off alone, and I got a camera a little bit hit. I was disappointed that the equipment was damaged a week."
"The battery is a joke, I have to charge it 3 times in the day, the camera, take the worst photos. all applications are paid. Luckily I just need it for my job. my Pixel 4XL is a thousand times better."
"Buy an IPhone 12 reconditioned with the theory that everything works perfectly but does not let me or configure it, does not let me pass from the section (select your country or region ), therefore I will return it, I will tell you how it went with the return, greetings"
"It's new."
"In excellent condition"
"Hello good night I would like to talk to someone who takes care of the quality of the iPhone is that it is grated and I expected it to be in better condition I expect your answer thank you"
"Striped screen, scratched lenses and sell it as ""renewed"" when it is clearly a product that has already been used and altered. 30 minutes were enough to realize that it was not worth it, on top they put a glass mica to ""hide"" the scratches and pretend that they are in mica when not, they are on the cell phone."
"The iPhone with an aesthetic of 9.7, a battery of 98%, so far nothing has failed."
"I raised 1000 pesos when cancelling the order and putting it back but excellent quality"

"I'm back. Your product went bad on the camera. I'm handing over the equipment. I want to know when you'll be able to give me back the money."
"I no longer claimed because from the beginning I knew it was reconditioned"
"The Iphone 12 64gb has many aesthetic details, scratched screen, punches on frames and battery at 87%. I made the return and I am waiting for my refund."
"It didn't work. The iPhone 12 I asked for didn't work. Its condition was good, however it could never be configured, it couldn't be updated and it didn't let me transfer the data, which made me think if it was STOPPED. I had already purchased a renewed iPhone 8 and had no problem, but this was a total disappointment.I returned the phone and to avoid problems better I won't buy it again."
"The cell phone came in aesthetically well, but it restarts for no reason at all and it seems just as they return it they put it on sale without really rebuffing it"

"The phone came with several stripes, it's not in perfect condition like other phones"
"A great gift for my girlfriend, she thought it was new but the generic box gave it away, still it's a great purchase if you're not interested in the manuals, the box and the original charger."

"Please I demand an explanation. The phone came with the power button completely glued or when making calls it was heard very low (I did everything I found in forums and specialized sites to try to raise the volume of my speaker and nothing). Finally I took it to an Apple store and they tell me that by being ""reconditioned"" apparently when they installed the screen it was stuck in the ignition button and on the speaker's grid to listen. The arrangement is worth more than the phone. PLEASE I EXIGN AN EXPLANATION BECAUSE I SELL A TELEPHONE AS IT IS A RIGHT STAFF!. I am attentive"

"It's not des blokiado it's pure lie that they sell unlocked phones not in gauntlet please"

"Cons:The iPhone came with generic box and generic accessories (which is described in the publication).A battery with a life of 81% (as described in the publication, but the battery if it feels old)Details of use on the sides, is iPhone is worn out and even detached in some areas especially of the buttons per use; I did not expect an impeccable design but in the lens of the camera it is appreciated as if it had fallen and the part of the paint is already mistreated and with slicing of the blow (on the edge of the lens).The worst: When placing my SIM did not grab the network either of AT&T or of Telcel , it always stayed in ""net not available"" for this reason was why I chose to return it.Furthermore at the time of inserting my SIM in the details section, it did not show my phone number but another completely different, which made me think that the previous owner or used a digital SIM (eSIM) details or still anchored to that number, this was another flag to return it.In the box comes a perfect note of the steps to return it, delete configurations and your product giving me to think that this minimum phone (e)."

It should be noted that I bought the cell phone in the condition of excellent re-conditioning. The cell phone did not come with any detail, no scratch. PERFECT ENTER, with 100% battery.

"It took a couple of days to use it and so far it has worked properly. It seems practically new, it has no details, it only had a bit of dirt on the part of the lighting input and on the receiver/speaker on the front (where the ear is put to speak). On the other hand, the battery came to 90%, although I would have liked it to come with better capacity, as I read some comments where they were delivered in better condition.

It was certainly an EXCELLENT purchase, recommended the seller at 100% of the moment, any situation later if anything arises I will keep them updated."
"I read good and bad comments, I know that it is always a risk to buy Reconditioned products but I decided to risk it and it was certainly the best, cell this new has limited warranty until August 2023, 100% battery, connects to the network without problems, I have been using it for a week and everything excellent.
