"All very correct and professional"
"The best is the price."
"Very good."
"The phone was unlocked, battery 90%."
"It works perfect."
"The cell phone was delivered in very good condition, with very slight signs of use. The only thing against it is that apparently the screen that changed it is not original, since in the configurations of the device it launches an alert telling me that the screen is not original or not well installed, otherwise the device was delivered as announced."
"The cell phone works regularly well, the proximity sensor wasn’t working well but it wasn’t a major problem.... The battery was consumed but I definitely think it’s the best battery that made iPhone lasts alloooo the day, I don’t recommend used phones for that price should cost less as it always comes with problems which result expensive to fix them at least in Ecuador"
"The whole phone is exelent unlocked and works well."
"Battery at 94% service life, without a single scratch, looks new, the only thing that didn't leave me completely happy is the charger that comes with, it's not original they are clear on that, but it's very poor quality for the price that is paid and for being Premium they should include a better quality charger. But the phone specifically is perfect."

"The phone arrived well looks something good already you see its excessive use with battery in 89% I think already very used to that it is worth more than 700$ but it works perfect today it activates to the line everything bad that does not make reality the account of the Apple store try to make a new one with my other email similarly does not grab the security code.. If I can not do the account of the Apple store I will have to return it and hope that to if they take the money to if it is back to my account thanks"

"$570 for this!, I'm really surprised, it's a good phone and it seems to me its strongest point 94% of battery life, I arrived the same day I asked for it thanks to Prime, his box brought a generic charger and a glass screen protector, something normal on second hand phones is scratches, this came with two pretty big scratches on the screen, (They don't interfere with the view of the screen and they don't get perceived at a considerable distance), when I put the screen protector completely disappeared so it's a good point, a case and everything is perfect, I hope it goes on like this these months, all looks good, the sim card took it smoothly and it took just a few minutes to bring my old Iphone information to this one. It's a good cell phone, very lucky, I hope you buy one and the seller sends you a good one!"

"It came with a protective plastic, and in very good condition to be already open from the original box, if it came with charger."
"I arrived in excellent condition and with a battery at 97%."
"The phone took a week to arrive, a day before the planned one, the truth came of very very good quality, until right now that I have been using it works perfectly, I use it with Telcel network and perfectly grabbed the signal, in the same aesthetic way it looks almost in perfect condition, only a small blow in a corner but the only thing, on the screen everything perfect, without any detail and it was my biggest fear because I saw many comments where it was scratched and this came all perfect, speakers, Face ID, calls, cameras, everything in perfect condition, as if it were all new. The only detail is that it came with 84% battery, I think that a little more and everything would have been perfect for me, arrived in a custom charge and the charger and cable are not original, so that they take into account that. For the price it seems an excellent purchase and I strongly recommend to buy it."
"Very good Product, I arrived in good condition and it took a month and did not cause me failures!!"
"I find it an excellent purchase for the cost and model of the phone, even though it already has its years works very well and still has other years of update.The only detail that I found it, is that they changed the screen, it is not the original of Apple, still it is a good screen, it is also oled, but if you compare it with another iphone with original screen if you see the difference, but it is something that really in the day nor notice, works very well.Esthetically it arrived well without details and with stack to 89%"
"♪ Stand new ♪"
"I bought this article a year and a half ago masomenos is still in good condition, excellent the camera, the only thing that I have had problems is that you don't listen when they call me and it doesn't vibrate when they call me but everything else is excellent.When I got there I came with two brands of pacifiers to the front implying that they had already opened it, so new because it isn't.I checked it and if I said that it had already been opened."
"I have learned not to doubt the quality of the refurbished products. I have not failed at all this cell phone and arrived with good percentage of battery. When you can, take advantage."
"I arrive in good condition the battery does not arrive perfect, the appearance is good, only the sound for the horn if it is damaged, but all well"
"I arrived well packaged with a generic charger and the cell phone, it's the only thing, at first sight I only had a scratch on the screen but with a glass mica it was fixed, you don't see anything, battery I reach 87%, I use it almost all day and at the end of my working day with a daily use; I arrive with 50-40% batteryI have 512 GB, maybe I was lucky but it was a good purchase"
"Bring all your accessories, excellent condition, very well packed"
"The best purchase I have made in Amazon, the team goes through perfectly a new one, is in excellent aesthetic conditions, battery life at 91% and arrived earlier than expected. I would definitely buy again, I am very satisfied"
"All right, aesthetic of 9.5/10, I give you this rating for the fact that I expected better volume on the speaker, also I expected better condition on the battery, I arrived with an 84% that is not so bad but if very soon I will have to change the battery to the device, that there if I already added another expense to it, otherwise everything went well, I liked that it arrived soon until before the expected, that it arrived with guarantee also and all well packed, only for the detail of the battery and the speaker I give it 4 stars, I would give it 4.5 but Amazon does not allow me to put .5, also I expected an original cable but the generic one is well and also I expected it to arrive with a bucket of 20w but I arrived with a good cube and I like the purchase, I recommend to the seller at 100"
"I got it in good condition and if it's original"
"I was in excellent condition."
"In aesthetics it seems new, it has no scratch or punch or anything, the screen brings a protective mica that I did not want to remove. Functionality to 100 without any detail. It is that practically looks new in truth, the only detail that could have is that the stack has a condition of 85% but so far it has not resulted in a problem, it has endured perfectly all day. Excellent buy so far."
"Functionally well, although I found details in the physical conditions of the iphone like a few scratches around the cameras, and on the buttons. At first glance it does show that it had a good time of use, but there is no major failure or blow that are very noticeable"
"Like new, everything's fantastic."
"I like it size, and especially I've always used Apple, it hasn't yet premiered...I'm sure it will give me excellent service!"
"I arrive in very good condition the cell phone  if I recommend it and apart the very good customer support !!!"
"Practically new equipment, with 100% aesthetic, 90% battery, so far working perfectly, I have 3 weeks with the ."
"Almost a year with him and my traveling partner hasn't let me down."
"I've been with my cell phone for 6 months, the stack is great, I don't have to charge it every time, excellent quality, screen intact, if I recommend a lot if you want to buy something at a good cost, I'll buy it again soon"
"the device is in perfect condition, I see that it brings technical support application if this warranty is valid ?"
"The phone arrived with 85% battery. The truth is that using it well lasts your battery one day.As for the condition of the computer, the phone arrived without a single rayon, nor seems to be used, the condition is excellent.Obviously, it arrives in a box different from the original one, well sealed that yes, it also brings a super generic charger and cable, but they work.For the price, it is fine.It is an excellent product, highly recommended."
"After 2 months of use has not given me any problem, I get 100% battery"
"I've been with the 1 month and everything Perfect came with the 90 of battery and without any punch previously I had bought another iPhone but with Amazon distributor and I had to return it the month because it was heated and lost the signal with this so far all right!"
"I like it very much, I recommend it but a lot of eye with the condition of the battery"
"good in relation to quality/price, if you would buy it again.The only detail is the battery is not at 100%"
"I'm impressed with the aesthetics of the cellular equipment, without any scratches, the equipment is totally new I would buy another cell phone again without problem, 100% recommended."
"Well, that's just all right."
"If it came badly mistreated more of the others that I have bought as reconditioned but its functioning is good but it does not feel like other direct envoys from Amazon.From the packing and box in a simple box that it is even scary to think that they sent it in packaging and went around jumping.And this one touched that it was like stained from the screen but only from the glass and it is only seen if you see it backlighted and a little scratched from the chrome of the bow but with the case no longer seen."
"It came with 100% battery, it's worked very well, without problems, and physically perfect."
"It came with 85% battery, it has a small rayon perceptible in the lower horn part. Except for that the aesthetic is almost perfect, I am happy with my purchase."
"After almost a year of use, the iPhone works perfectly well. The truth was that I was looking forward to buying a reconditioned cell phone but so far absolutely everything serves EXCEPT by the speakers; they are not burst but they are not working 100% (if I use the speaker in a call it can sometimes be difficult to hear). Either way I use hearing aids and the top speaker for calls does not represent any problem. When it came to me, it came in generic box and without charger. It did not come to me with dents or scratched screen or any visible detail. It looked practically new. The truth if I recommend it because the prices of the Iphone Pro Max in Mexico at those dates were for 20-30 thousand pesos in different shops and saved me a lot of pejedolars."
"I made my purchases with different sellers but the same Amazon product marks me in the same place.In the first purchase the cell phone came perfect, 100% battery without any aesthetic detail, original and practically new, the only thing was that it was not released, they could not help me and I had to return it, that seller had no more devices, I had to look for another one.The second purchase, the cell phone worked ""well"", it came to me with 85% battery and very stained glass from the back, so that did not please me and I decided to give it the opportunity a few days, but checking with other acquaintances iphone,!the camera came of very poor quality!, it looked very blurred compared to the other cell phones, that was what made me decide to return it."
"The product arrived me with a day of delay, arrived in a generic box. The charger also generic.The aesthetic I put a 10, the screen came with tempered glass mica.I have not noticed any scratch on the screen or anything.I have been with it for a little more than a week, and so far it works well.As for the degradation of the battery I arrived with 93%.The product I bought it in $11,999 to 1 year, months without interest.The negative:When I update to IOS15.5 the battery is degraded to 88% (see image) I ask:Is this normal?Do I already communicate with BuySpRY and they answered me, send them the screenshot of the health of the battery, as well as the IMEIConclusion: In general I am happy with the purchase, the only defect, is that the health of the battery is deteriorated, by updating the operating system."
"It came to me with 85% of the battery and the horn doesn't sound good."
"The process of acquiring my device was very particular as I found the publication and 20 minutes later I decided to buy it, obviously because it was an online purchase of a cell phone “caro”, “discontinuous” and re-conditioning did not feel completely safe, since I thought it was going to be a type of scam or it was not going to arrive in the conditions that I expected, fortunately everything I thought was false since I have been using it for about 2 weeks and night and it has not presented me any fault so far, it should be noted that I received it without any damage and with the condition of my battery to 94%, I supported much of the comments of the publication and I was aware that it was trusting and having a little luck that it did not arrive damaged, I repeat, until now everything has gone well and I will continue to use it day, fortunately the cell counts with warranty with Amazon and it is original, just as I distrust a little for the price since in other places it was worth more and for less capacity in memory, but one advice that I can give them is to try it, buy it, try it, check it out, check it out as it does it does it does it does it out with the warranty with them, I do them out, I do not apply the warranty and I do it and I do a little bit because I did it at all the price as well because in other."
"The product is reconstructed as they say, the bad thing is that they do not use original parts so the phone has the feature of detecting the component that is not original. Despite all this the phone works properly, so far I have not found any problem for its correct functioning. as far as aesthetics is practically new it does not have any rayon. Percentage of the battery is 100%."
"It is very good device if you find it on offer it arrived with 94% battery works with Telcel in Mexico and with Redi Coppel without problems with Altan networks"
"At first I had doubts for some negative comments that I found, I decided to take a risk and did the purchase. The package arrived 2 days earlier than estimated so it was quite fast. As for the aesthetics it is quite good, light scratches on the side chromes and a small rayon on screen, which is concealed quite well with a screen protector, as for the rear, the aesthetic is impeccable, in terms of battery arrived with 86%.I have been using it for a short time and so far has not presented any problem.The only negative detail that I found, was the charger and cable that they bring, they feel of very little quality and the charge is quite slow.I recommend buying an original one to avoid later problems with the charge or battery of the equipment."
"I have been with the phone for 10 days, arrived in very good condition, in a generic box with generic charger and cable as mentioned in the description, did not bring any scratch on the edges or on the back, I removed the protective mica from the screen and only brings two small scratches as if they had put it in the bag and scratched it with coins or keys, but it does not affect the operation, I re-placed the mica and everything looks new, I no longer had an apple care guarantee, it brings a living condition of 91% and it indicates to me that it continues to calibrate the battery, at the end of the calibration it dropped to 89%, I would have liked it to come with more life condition as I read in most comments they had above 95%, but well, the face id works very well, the volume, microphone and horn work very well, the camera is a beauty, and I think it was a good purchase, it is advisable to buy the original cable and charger to keep the battery in good condition, according to Apple to have up to 80% of battery is optimal, although I repeat, I would have liked that it brought better condition than 89%..."
"I really liked the phone I arrived impeccable with a 92% battery, with the color that I asked for even came with a protective glass.What I did not like is that it comes with a generic charger that is not the original and it gets very warm when I put it to charge and in only 2 days low from 92% to 90% the condition of the battery. I consider that for the price of $13,500 pesos it must have included an original charger so that this part does not be affected since it is a reconditioning product this if it affects the phone and it is cost to change a new battery. (PD send me an original charger )"
"After 3 months of use, the cell phone works smoothly. It is worth acquiring these products. I get 86% battery and some scratches on the screen. With the screen protector you do not notice any scratches"
"I get it because I'm bored of dealing with STORAGE WITH OTHER IPHONES, I'M DEEDING TO CONTENT CREATION, SO STORAGE IS INDISpensABLE TO ME, FOR MY IT WAS A INVESTMENT MORE THAN A LUXURY, AND I'M SATISHED, WITHOUT EMBARGO, THERE'S A LOT TO BE TAKE CARE OF BECAUSE IT'S A LESS AND A DONE FALL."
"After a lousy experience with achemex with a first purchase where I got a stack instead of the iphone, I chose buyspry for his good comments, I got a battery equipment to 83%, all original except the display, the application 3utool indicated to me that it was changed and if you notice because it has some glue on its sides, the display is somewhat scratched by the use and everything else is impeccable, due to the urgency that I have decided to keep it, but it will be on the lookout for the operation,"
"Come on, the phone itself is of very good quality and for the price, it is worth buying it.Just a few days ago I received it and I am testing its performance, performance and functions to decide if it is a computer that is worth staying or making effective the 90-day warranty that is offered when purchasing it.So far the details that I have found, despite knowing that it is a used equipment, has enough scratches on the front screen that do not affect the operation and usually go unnoticed with a protective mica, some details on the bezels of the cameras and two or three strokes and scrapes on the edges of the phone, does not seem anything serious but the aesthetic lets you want and ""note"" that it is a used equipment.Another detail, the battery reached 87%, understandable when used, but it would be a plus that had at least 90%.In general with the purchase, well, nothing extraordinary but with a view to making use of the warranty."
"It arrived in perfect conditions, practically new. I recommend to buy"
"Excellent, first of all the device came without any physical damage, I checked it in detail and did not find a single rayon, came without software problems and the condition reached me at 85%, I thought it would be a problem that battery but the battery lasts me all day, I have been using it for two months and I have not had any problems, the reviews that I read before encouraging me to buy the iphone discouraged me a bit, but I decided to risk and I am very happy and satisfied with the purchase, 100% recommended!!"
"Good team, at first hesitate a lot to buy used as I have read some bad reviews and other good ones, in my case the team that arrived to me has not presented problems (3 months of use).I arrived quite well packing, without scratches, without blows, the phone was quite good.Of course it pays a little more for Amazon but you are paying SAFETY and QUALITY, each phone comes with a hand-filled inspection card on someone who inspected and cleaned the phone.I arrive with 90% of the battery capacity that promises the publication and I have not had topics that the Pila does not last or that the phone heats up.If you are doubting whether to trust or not Amazon Renewed uses this review as evidence that fulfills what it promises and you have the advantage of returning it if it does not meet your expectations or the description."
"I arrived in perfect condition of everything except that the audio horn where you answer the calls was a little dirty but it led to the general cleaning of the whole device and I was in perfect condition, I arrived with a 94% battery is the 3 apparatus that I bought renovated and I have not had any problem with any of them"
"Well then the product arrived me in good condition but in the part of the horn , it looks a little grated but with a cover it is not noticeable , of the prosesador this very well I arrive with the 87% pile and I have already used it and well. the good that has 90 days of guarantee"
"The cost-benefit of the product is good as long as it works"
"We know that a refurbished phone can bring some details, but we still hope that they are smaller and that it is worth what we are paying. I don’t know if in the photos you will get to appreciate but the phone came with a major hit on a corner and several deep rallions on the screen, so I decided that I’ll return it."
"The phone is good it fulfills all the functions and the battery to 90% as mentioned in the description only that I have two months with the and the charger no longer works any of the doscable nor the quadrito of the current, in the product if it specifies that the product as it is refurbished does not contain original accessories but that Amazon checks that the accessories are of quality, unfortunately the charger of the phone that I bought did not work and the worst is that the purchase does not give me option to report it. I feel that for this type of products Amazon should better verify the quality of the accessories that they send"
"Excellent equipment, the only one but is the life of the Battery, came in 84% of there no details."
"The excellent cell phone in my case the battery reached 100%, very small details at the top but almost imperceptible I highly recommend"
"I had my doubts at the time of buying it the team is in a 99 of aesthetics the only bad thing was that the battery reached 84%"
"The product arrived without any problem. When I opened it I realized that it is practically new. The charger is not original (they warn you from the purchase) but the problem is that it is not compatible the voltage and does not manage to load it correctly, it could even damage it since it was heated.If you have a new charger from some previous iPhone it is better to use it.Out of that, it is a great purchase and I am satisfied."
"Charger cable not working"
"At the beginning it was a bit gullible, many other users comment that they have reached equipment with 90% to 99% of battery in my case it was not so, if not that ah arrived with 100% but, the whole screen is with micro stripes, like the lenses of the camera, that is to say by far if you can appreciate that it is very scratched more when the light gives it directly, I hope to be able to solve it applying a mica, but of the rest I am very happy so far the photographs have not had problem thinking that also the lenses are too scratched, I do not blame to its previous owner the fact of not putting some protector in the end is the taste of each person and for that reason it lowers the price of the team.At the end, this is like a roulette that luck will touch us a good team like a bad one."
"The team arrived a day before the estimated date. It was a complete surprise. I couldn’t wait. It came with 90% capacity, somewhat less than I had expected. It included a generic charger, but it works well and a pincito to pull out the chip, nothing else. Mica included, but it has two circular marks that I have no idea where they came from, although they only look against the light. The equipment works well, a cover is extremely necessary because it is very slippery without one, sometimes like it takes long to grab the cellular connection, but it’s just a matter of waiting. Lenses in good condition, functional camera, flash works well, horn works well, buttons work well. The rest are complaints that I have about the system and the screen size, but nothing to do with the Amazon service. In short, I bought it because there was a bank promotion, and I was looking for it several days because sometimes it cost almost 1000 pesos less, I don’t know what factors there are to make these price changes happen, the only thing I know is that 18K is too hard. The battery does it, although it’s not extraordinary, I wouldn’t expect it’t have less of the “i Camera very good”."
"The phone in perfect condition, there is an inconvenience I have inconsistencies in the network and unfortunately it is only compatible with the AT&T network if it was compatible with all companies in Mexico would be perfect"
"I arrived very quickly the team was impeccable only the earphone or horn was heard very badly I had to return it, as well as arriving my return I will ask again I hope that now if everything comes well"
"Very good."
"I give you 4 stars because the screen came very scratched, only from day to day interferes with visibility, otherwise the cell phone works very well and fulfills, of necessity do not return it, but if you can not accept one with scratches, it is better to change it"
"The phone arrived well, the screen a little grated the truth is that it is not bad yet that if I expected a phone with a higher battery condition since the price of 12,000 because if it is something high, I reach with 87% of everything else well"
"Good aesthetics."
"Except for a tiny rayon on the right hand side the phone is spectacular! I had an iphone 6 s and I could no longer endure jaja, the upgrade was great, it came with generic charger but charged in 2 hours and I can easily give it 12 hours of continuous use. The stack arriving was 90%, I waited months to write this review and the pile is still 90%! That yes, I do not use it when it is charging for nothing. I already came with protector for the front and back, so I could start using it without fear that it would scratch (only has a thin mica, but does the job), in general very good product!"
"In good general condition, stack 90% a slight scrape on the screen, out of that well"
"It's a good purchase, it came to me with 94% battery in excellent condition, no scratches, no defects. I've been with it for 4 months and it works properly."
"The only “bad” would be the generic charger with which it comes as it charges too slow. But well, it is reconditioned, neither Apple gives it to you with a pulley charger. Outside of that, aesthetically and functionally arrived in perfect condition and with a battery condition at 91%. Everything excellent and without any inconvenience, even came 3 days after making my purchase"
"The iPhone came to me without any apparent cosmetic problem and with 93% battery, generic charger of good quality. Satisfied with my purchase!"
"If I had a little more battery life than best"
"I liked it very much, I had never had an Iphone, I had my distrust if to buy it, but already after a month seeing it arrived in perfect conditions, of course it brings generic charger was not going to arrive with the original, although you can buy the original separately afterwards, the screen is very good and the phone has no aesthetic detail, only be careful is very light and slippery I recommend buying some cover and mica for greater protection."
"I asked the IVECSA STORE's tendency with some fear of reading that I am sending products that were not what they were asking for and in all the problems was Amazon's parcel delivery I took a chance and I asked my surprise was that my cell phone has never been opened this as a bone factory is NOT RECONDITIONED, the only detail that has is minimal scratches on the screen that with the mica you do not see, I am very happy with my purchase."
"It comes very well packing, it came with tempered glass when I took it off it had some scratches on the screen of the top right does not affect anything, everything else is very well maintained the cell phone, it would battery 88%, I have been using it almost 14 days and it goes very well, so far no faults and if you look for an iPhone this is the indicator quality price"
"The team is very good, I have no problem with it, I have been using it for a week and it seems to be in optimal condition. It brings aesthetic details like scratches on the screen and in one of the cameras. Battery comes to 88% and I think from there on out is fine"
"I will detail the following: the phone was received in good packing condition, when you open the box you find a generic sealed box, inside the iPhone, charger and cable, aesthetically the phone was in excellent almost immaculate condition I would say, with some small scratches in the frame of the phone however it took me the surprise to remove the tempered glass that is already installed when the iPhone arrives, with very notorious and deep scratches throughout the screen, that come to subtract a lot from the overall aesthetics of the computer, I had read that these iPhones already carried that tempered glass installed to precisely cover those scratches and that they pass unnoticed, and I can confirm that it is true.Battery arrived at 92%, loudspeakers, microphones and cameras working perfectly, it comes released, however it does not work with Altan networks.However a few days later, I started to notice what in the back of the phone appreciated a small opening what made me doubt if the phone was well sealed and in the uncertainty of thinking that it could get bigger I decided to return the phone."
"I had doubt to buy it but in the end I arrived with aesthetics of 10 and with battery of 84"
"Battery to 80%When reading other reviews I had very high expectationsI thought that really aesthetically it would look divineBut on the front of the screen above the face it is like scraping or as if it was flawless to put back the screenLigeros stems that are not seen in the golden order of the frame by the chargerSo far I work very well I have little with the upgrade afterI feel that it cost me a little more than if I bought one of use of the same model on the other handIt's my first iPhone since iPhone 4 had always used Samsung, I thought that I would do itBut the truth is that it is very good when functions the dual sim never works the chip so I use it as uni sim"
"The charger they sent him with stopped working two weeks later, but in itself, the phone works very well and had no aesthetic details."
"Excellent conditions"
"The screen came scratched and punched"
"Excellent quality and price"
"I've been working with him for 3 days at 100% that I arrived with a few scratches on the screen, they don't affect and with the battery at 87%"
"I was very satisfied with the product, practically it seems that it is new, it only has a very light scrape on top but caused by the case from there out the impeccable screen and very good performance. I had my doubts to buy for some reviews, but in the end it was a good decision"
"The product is Original, at first I thought the antenna was damaged, then I realized that I was turning the SIM upside down, the conditions of the equipment are very good, the battery has 100% charge retention, although the screen comes too scratched and some very deep and very noticeable"
"The truth was a little scary reading some of the less favorable comments. But I was encouraged as I saw that returns could be made and that there was good communication with the seller. The product came to me in a box x, and with a current adapter x as well as they say in the publication. The iPhone arrived nine and when I turned it on I reached almost 100% battery and with the new update it did not take me any surprise for bad.It also lasted several days waiting since they drive months without interest but I think one should be attentive for when they put them because they only last a few days and then without months and then they come back."
"The product came as new with 95% battery, only some scrapes in the area around the cameras but nothing that affected its operation, the cell phone worked with my cell company and in general I have none but, as if I had bought it new"
"The iPhone arrived in an excellent condition , aesthetic 9/10, lightweight brands of use in the frames that are only appreciated if you look very closely.The screen very well, included a mica, when removing it you see light brands of use on the screen that are only noticeable without the mica and only if you look very closely and with a strong light.The back and camera are impeccable, not a single rayon nor a single brand of use.The battery reaches 96%How to expect to arrive in a generic box with cable and generic chargers but it is no problem because you can easily buy Apple officers.Generally very satisfied, it is a good option to get a device of this type and saves a little money"
"The iPhone that came to me comes in excellent condition I have tried it several days and I have no complaint the battery was 100% and very well cared for!"
"the truth the team arrived in excellent condition, without any details and working perfectly. do not fear to buy reconditioned products, the truth are very good and at an excellent price."
"I bought my iPhone 11 pro max of 256 gb with a little fear. Obviously the product is a “semi-new” computer or as the seller says “renewed”. However, my surprise was that I got a phone in very good condition. The battery at 93% and with a my good aesthetic. The screen came with a pre-installed tempered glass, that when I changed it for another, I could notice that the screen has some small scratches, but nothing to prevent me from enjoying the phone. What if I have to say, the charger (cubo) is a mockery, of very poor quality, the only thing to recover was the lighting cable. I didn’t have much trouble, because I charged it with the charger of my iPad (20w) which makes the fast charge work. I’m about to fulfill a month with the equipment, if I had an additional comment, I update my review."
"Very good product came to me as new and has very good functioning"
"Battery 84%Aesthetic only had a scratch on the frameAll right"
"The product in general comes very well, not damaged or mistreated, not scratches the capacity of the battery is 92% the only bad thing is that the screen is not the original apple; it is noticed in the quality of the colors"
"It has many features and can be taken advantage of to the maximum."
"The shipment was very fast, more than in other purchases that have been made, the product actually exceeded my expectations by a lot, very good purchase really, I didn't have or at least I didn't notice any aesthetic details, the life of the battery reached 85% but it yields me better than another that I had alive of 90%"
"It's a good phone, no damage, the horn sounds great, but on receiving it it didn't bring charger and mentions that if it was included, I need to investigate how to report it to the provider."
"I really like the color the service the important is functional and you save many weights the aesthetic came out 9/10 which is great for the price"
"The team arrived in perfect condition, battery at 100% no scratch or punch is as if it were new, I totally recommend to the seller ivecsa store ; previously I had bought one buyspry in silver color but arrived scratched from the frame and with a dent near the camera that left a mark like “bubble” on the glass , that same day I asked for the return."
"The cell phone came to me with impeccable quality, practically as new no physical damage or scraping on screen.Battery at 90I used it almost the month and without problemsI am very satisfied with the purchaseLoader and cable of good quality."
"I had my doubts before buying it, but I am more than satisfied with the state of the phone. It is practically a new team. And what I encourage in the end was the support of Amazon. It will not be the last one I buy in Renewed."
"It came to me with 87 drums but the truth is that it doesn't show, the battery lasts all day.It came with generic charger but it hasn't warmed up or anything strange."
"The truth is that I am very happy with my purchase. I arrive the other day of my payment, I came in a simple but well protected box, I brought a glass mica and a plastic projector, I brought the little iron to open the chip holder, the charger if you see half a chafa jaja but because there I said that generic and it fulfills its function, it came with the battery to 97%, if it comes released, I put the Telcel chip in Mexico and it is all in order, I have been using it for 3 days and I am super happy, I give it to me for birthday. The truth I wanted to buy it on the other side but because if it was a lot of money and because I feared that they would steal it, then I decided for Amazon as it promises 90 days guarantee and they return all the money, so I confided, I hope I did not miss the cell phone, but the truth comes almost as new, it only has 2 mini scratches almost imperceptible on a side of the screen, so I don't think that nothing happens to it."
"The media could not be loaded. All right, a few scratches on the sides but no gravity, in general it is in good condition, everything works perfect, with 86% battery, for the price you pay it worth, I am satisfied"
"All right, a few scratches on the sides but no gravity, in general it's in good condition, everything works perfect, with 86% battery, for the price you pay it is worth, I'm satisfied"
"The phone is excellent its operation is Perfect, cameras in perfect condition, screen without any scratches just like the impeccable back part, the quality is 10/10, but I put 4 stars since it is written very clearly that the phone comes with 90% minimum battery performance, and mine arrived with 86% which I do not like very much, from there on more everything Perfect"
"This product came very well to the exception of one detail. At the time of using the camera of the phone this starts to make noise and the camera vibrates. This does not allow taking pictures or videos properly."
"It is an excellent option for those who want an iPhone with service guarantee at a lower price"
"The caller's loudspeaker's too low."
"The phone came to me with 86% battery life, aesthetically it is perfect except a corner of the screen that has scratched like when you bring the phone and also the keys and it goes scratching with the movement, that I do not like because I have had iPhone for years and I have never been scratched like this, it does not affect its operation and everything internally works well"
"The cell phone came whole, does not seem reconstructed, without dents, without scratches or anything aesthetic, functionality to 100, sound to 100 very good model."
"In general it is in good condition, 85% battery when arriving, works well but soon it began to lock, to have small faults that were presented more and more frequently. I did not like it, it was not worth the purchase, only if you like it very much and you do not want to pay for a new one."
"Send my doubts But the equipment is in very good condition, works everything 100% and the battery at 95%"
"The equipment got me damaged, the camera doesn't work properly aesthetically is an 8 but being reconditioned is understandable"
"The equipment is super good, 100% battery and aesthetic with 99%"
"2 months working perfectly battery to 100% aesthetic 10/10 I found no defect. I have had good experience with Reconditioned Cell phones. I recommend it!"
"The phone arrived in time and shape, although it does not arrive in its original box or with original charger or cable, aesthetically arrived 9/10, if you expect a “new” phone because this is not your option haha, I can emphasize that it came with a small rayon on the screen, but from there on out the phone is like new, battery to 90% and so far I am happy with the purchase, it is worth it for the phone that is, the same and you have enough time to return it, it is to risk but because to me it was made good purchase"
"I would put 5 stars but the screen had a few slight stripes. The good thing is that already with the mica of hydrogel mate they do not show. I was about to return it but finally I stayed it and it works well. Only that, the stripes on the screen."
"It is my first purchase at Amazon Renewed, BuySpry continue to sell iphones in this state and I will buy again with you. My iphone 11 pro max arrived in excellent physical and operational condition pile to 91% I have been with him one day and at the moment it has not failed, I hope it continues like this. Products with excellent aesthetics and correct functioning do not have to be returned. The seller solves the questions very quickly."
"It brought a few blows in the corners, nothing that affects the operation, with the cover you can see practically nothing, the screen already had a mica on, the activation process was very easy and fast, the computer works quite well, the screen very well, the excellent photos, I have no complaint, the battery arrived with 97% of life."
"It's all very well."
"Phone of very low quality, basically I will say it is a crappy, for what costs there is better choice! This super reconditioned and has generic pieces (pirates)"
"I arrived in excellent condition, I had doubts mainly with the stack because there were good comments and some bad ones, but this very nice one brought a aesthetic of 9.9 the stack was at 100, I arrived in box that generic with equal charger, but I use it with another one that already had and it is very well the load lasts much longer than the SE 2020 would definitely buy it again only have to check the seller, many are advertised but not all have good comments some do not even send them."
"The equipment is like new, its aesthetic could be said perfect; 96% battery and so far works very well."
"I had my doubts about being a refurbished team, arrived just in time and in excellent condition. As new already with mica on the screen, charger and cable. I recommend a lot to buy at BuySpry"
"The phone bought it a couple of days ago because it encouraged me to switch to iPhone and wanted something ""new"" the phone came with a flawless glass mica like the screen and the back of the phone but the sides looked like they had shoved it up the ass to the previous owner was very scratched to the point where I thought they had been sanded and let's be honest obvious that for the price it is worth the phone version but I don't think it's worth paying 17k or 15k so that it's so scratched and it looks like they dragged it down the floor, I know that they will tell me that as long as the device serves it doesn't matter the rest but if at some time you want to sell that it would lower the value to the product because it's already scratched like the battery didn't come so bad it counted 89% of use :)"
"This review I write after a time of use, the team arrived well without apparent scratches with mica, remove the mica and had bolts of use, this personally did not bother me what if I did not like and ended in return was the rapid degradation of the battery, I arrived with 98% and in less than a month it went to 96, then 94 and in two and a half months I had 90% I did the calibration and I stayed in the same percentage besides being notorious to use, I never used it while charging and using an apple charger that I have that it is not fast charge (I have had and I have apple products) so I did not bad usl that the normal without playing heavy games (it never got warmed) I guess the pile went wrong ... I don't think it is like this in all the renovated ones so if I recommend but check them very well."
"Buy this phone for my daily use and be very happy, it was the second time that I bought a device so and I really loved how the device arrives, without scratches, the screen in perfect condition, its battery with a high percentage of life still, very happy the truth. I totally recommend it."
"I haven't been 3 months and it turns on and off, could you support me on how I could make the change or refund?"
"The battery equipment has a 100% integrity, the housing is in perfect condition without the slightest scratch or hit, but the screen did find many scratches caused by keys or tools, even one of them is deep right in the position of the lens in the front camera. At certain angles the light is minimally reflected by the rayon. It does not affect its operation and with a mica of glass or hydrogel scratches are covered. The charger and cable are generic and the box in turn is generic of good quality."
"I have a month with the team arrived well a good aesthetic, battery of 86% so far without faults."
"All right, the Face ID failed about 2 months, but it's all in order."
"I arrived in super good condition, without any detail and the battery above 90%. Super satisfied with my purchase"
"I laughed at it reading several comments that some teams didn’t pull well or after a few days I didn’t have a signal but the truth was that they sent me this almost new one. And it’s 100% alive the pile. I have almost 2 weeks to use it and this is right right now. Only one day I came out if I had a signal but they didn’t come in and there were no calls or data. But I only got into the mitelcel page (I have cell) and I recorded it as saying a little paper that came with the cell. I don’t know if it was for that reason or flat the network shut down for a moment. Typical Telcel if it gets beat when it rains or it’s cloudy. I don’t know if I can recommend it taking account of the other buyers and not all the “renewed” are identical. Aveses asas as the new ones come failing from the factory but the good that ai will always give you another. Here you risk the condition that they make it."
"The phone arrived in generic box and generic functional charger, the battery capacity arrived at 86% , almost nil aesthetic details, the horn is a little misheard, distorted in volume something, if another detail comes out I will consider returning it."
"Equipment in perfect condition, I love it. Good view charger, 3-foot cable, good finishes. Battery condition 90%, I will be testing how much durability is within the warranty period. The package arrived earlier than agreed."
"The equipment is as new, but obvious it is not... 9/10 quality cost ratio is definitely the best option for secure and guaranteed purchase. Aesthetic 10/10 and battery 86%. Generic accessories and generic box."
"Product as described in the description"
"I returned it because it did not meet the standards mentioned in the publication. Poor quality, it does not look new and the battery status was 79%. Make the return and the buyer very good attention made me refund when they revoked my item."
"very good condition, battery 89% without scratches or anything"
"It was my first experience buying renewed and my iPhone arrived impeccable! Obviously it did not arrive in its original box or original accessories but the phone arrived with 100% battery and even with mica for the screen. The only thing that I was slightly dissatisfied with is that the cable that came does not have information that corroborate that it is MFI but out of that, arrives packaged super well. If I buy it again from Buyspry! It should be noted that I bought it by April and for October it remains fully functional."
"I bought this cell phone on June 23, 2021 I make this comment on September 19th almost 3 months of using it, so far everything very well, without any serious detail of use or damage, it only brings two ralloncitos on the screen, nothing that dislikes it. I defined it does not come with charger, nor original box but the truth that nothing happens, the charger works much faster than that of my iPad. So you avoid spending more money for an original. So far I think it was a very good purchase. Greetings!"
"The team arrived well, as the publication says, semi-new equipment, battery life 82%, equipment with Mica on screen, charger and generic usb, and everything working perfectly"
"Estetica of 10, but when I try it a few days, it takes nothing , it has 82% of bat, already has 12 days that I have returned it and I do not give my refund, pessimo service."
"The equipment works and operates correctly according to manufacturer’s specifications. However, although its condition of refurbishment is clearly specified, the equipment arrived with a glass mica attached to the screen, thus minimizing a very slight scratches. Perhaps it would be worth publishing images of the real products for the cases of refurbishments, instead of catalog images."
"I have used it already for a month, this in excellent condition, I arrive with 91% battery, it is lucky, I asked for another two and they arrived with 86 and 81, I returned them and the third I arrived another 90%, it is a question of risking but everything excellent."
"The ratio PRICE QUALITY is acceptable, the battery is at 90% (it arrived with 91 a month ago), but being an iPhone is already known that this is the thing, I have to mention that it will scare me when I wanted to start backing the cell phone to this new ME FEAR THE PREVIOUS DONE OF THE APPARATO, I thought it was totally deleted, or its not if it is part of the operation, the thing is that today my cell phone is running 100% in all its things without anything weird, (that well all iPhones I have had suddenly have some strange completion for some time) that I attribute to Apple's iOS ... RECOGNIZING IT, by the way all in time and form."
"I have been with him since September , It arrived in good condition, as new aesthetically only the battery arrived in 89% and in 1 month it went down to 86% but I think it is for the charger you have to buy the original, everything else goes well, all the pieces that it has are original"
"I got an original iPhone in very good condition the only detail was the screen that was very scratched but with the mica you can no longer see the marks so far all well and the battery reached 88 percent"
"I bought the equipment and everything was perfect until I realized that it warmed up, sometimes I did when I saw Facebook or instagram, it happened at completely random moments. Sometimes it warmed up too much and it just cooled down until I turned it off, I certainly had to return it for fear that the battery would get worse very quickly because of this."
"The only detail I would mention is that the condition of the battery is 85%, I expected at least above 90%, but well the description of the product warns."
"I get there on time, all right up to now and the battery comes to 86 for the price that I don't like so much:/"
"It came with aesthetics of 10 and 97 on the battery. I barely have 4 days of use and everything perfect."
"Actually, rather than selling you a product renewed for some detail, what they sell is a second-hand product. In my case, the equipment even comes with a protective mica and on the edges you notice some dirt, that is, they did not even clean it. On the other hand, the battery life is 85% (average useful life of the equipment that friends or acquaintances currently have and that they acquired when the product went out to market)."
"I loved everything, it looks new, it has no detail, the battery at 100% just for the charger and the box that are not original, but the equipment certainly a marvel, the best purchase I could have made, thanks to the seller"
"I had my doubts about buying a used product, but when talking about something like an iPhone, but the cell phone came to me in three days, practically this new one, has no defect , the battery at 100%. I think it makes an excellent purchase since when comparing the price of a new one with this used there is a lot of difference and in terms of quality and aesthetics in the used one, practically none. I would buy again."
"All right, just that they didn't mention that I had a fault in the Face ID, I knew I wasn't buying a new cell phone, but a tool like that essential on the phone has to be mentioned, otherwise I'm satisfied."
"Cell phone is the best I've ever had, battery life is a bestiality 10/10"
"Carved in the corner With light exterior details rating 8 of 10"
"It is what I expected according to the description of the product, had a generic box, well packed, charger (5W) and generic cable, does not include audiophones, tegngo using it two weeks and all well so far, already updated to 14.5, the screen and the back well, some stripes and blows in the corners. Horn, entrances and camera well, the maximum capacity of the battery was 94%, now it is 93, I only disappoint the battery (that is why the 4 stars), in general I would recommend it."
"Cell is good aesthetic condition, works very well, comes with generic charger, battery is very good condition"
"would hit 88% everything else perfect as new, if problems"
"This is the 2nd time I asked, the first came with 83% battery and I returned it, this wine as new, and 90% battery, I really recommend excellent option"
"The phone arrives in good condition, the battery condition reached 92% the only bad thing is the charger says it is the one to wear but looks very bad warm as well as the cable."
"very good only scrapes on the side and the charger is of very poor quality, it should integrate a certified"
"Excellent product! I arrived with a 97% battery life now I have 94 two months later. But in functional 10/10 very nice as new! If you are looking for a phone for a reasonable price it is your choice. :)"
"The phone is only in excellent condition, the battery reached 90%. It is an excellent phone"
"The team arrived super well only with a couple of scratches on the screen but nothing to worry about, everything else is very well, the stack is at 91%"
"The quality is premium as the ad says, only the shipping payment if it is more expensive in this application than in others"
"93% battery condition. No failure."
"I've been using it for 1 day, so far it arrived well, it has no details, more than a few scratches on the screen, if you're very demanding, I don't recommend it, but if you can pass a few scratches, it's perfect, 100% recommended The battery comes with 88%"
"Good equipment but does not come 3n its original packaging and does not have the original charger."
"All good customer service who kindly attended a request"
"Excellent 91% battery without scratches On screen or anywhere, I am waiting only for the invoice and out of which the charger is not original I am totally delighted that the device arrived in such good condition."
"All right, with small usage marks, but nothing exaggerated..."
"The phone came with 87% battery and aesthetics of 10 had no scratches only that they send it in generic box and generic chargers my purchase was with recommended clevermex"
"99% battery, original components, completely impeccable, I highly recommend it."
"I bought it recently but until today everything perfect, it warms up a bit when charging but I guess it is normal, aesthetic 10, cameras 10, everything goes very well I like very much . I hope it continues like this"
"Because they do not ensure the correct functioning of these renewed? equipment is the second that I receive with the same fault, the first plane was not heard and in this case it is heard very low, forcing to open the speaker to hold a phone call, obviously this is not always possible. I need to change it to one that works correctly."
"The cell phone is as if it were new, not unique is that to me it arrived with 86% stack and the cable and the cube is generic, but in the other aspects I recommend it"
"Very good as new only they sent old charger"
"I just have a week with equipment, so far everything is fine. I had stayed quite behind, had an Iphone 6s plus and an 8 Plus, so I am happy with the change. Considering that I am only interested in basic social media and photos functions, I am satisfied with the purchase. The battery arrived with a maximum capacity at 96% which is very reasonable for the price. I update reviews in a couple of months."
"The ratio of quality to price is very good, but I must admit that the charger with which the phone comes, is generic and has no hearing aids, so if we do the sum of those two items is approximately 3,000 pesos you have to add to the final value of the computer. Just for your information."
"Excellent product arrived in less than 2 days, aesthetic 9.8 since the battery had 87%, small scratches but nothing to worry about. The truth is highly recommended"
"The price is still high to be a team that has changed parts"
"The team is super good, it works perfectly without problems, without crashed everything very well. The only thing you should be aware of is the pile to me came with 88% but it has been lasting me the stack and full day"
"It came in generic box with a charger of another brand but with the plus that is fast charging, (charger that Apple does not give you when you buy the phone by the way). The phone is practically new with battery life at 100%. I guess it’s lucky because this cell phone arrived impeccable but I also bought a silver iPhone xs and that cell came worn off from the sides, minimal stripes on the screen and battery at 81%. I don’t know what it depends on..."
"Everything excellent came to me with an 89% battery without any scratches take away the mica that it brings to see if it brings scratches the screen brought one but it is not seen when putting the tempered glass and without the crystal you have to look well to the reflection of the Light so that it is noticed I totally recommend it with charger and generic box that at the end of the day that does not worry me because I carry it with its original charger"
"It came a bit scratchy but they disguise it with a mica and it warmed up, but when it was updated the overheating was composed, and the scratches were minimal details"
"The cell phone arrived in very good condition and works like new!"
"Even now I work excellently well the battery lasts me 2 days. My question is whether it is waterproof."
"The phone comes with generic charger, does not come in original box. The phone came to me with mica and the percentage of life of the battery is 88%. Aesthetically it looks like new and I do not see any detail, everything works correctly."
"It's perfect, it works like new."
"The only detail is that the battery life is very low 85% I am disappointed, try to return the product but did not leave me. First and last time I buy refurbished equipment."
"It's the best purchase I could have made, it came to me with 95 battery, impeccable, aesthetic of 10, DEFINITIVELY I'D BUY IT BACK"
"I had a pleasant experience with the completely original device and with all functions at 100%, and with very good percentage of battery life, without screen scratches or cameras, I highly recommend it as new"
"Bad quality charger, but the product very well"
"Super well taken care of I arrived in aesthetics, all well until the 3rd week that the unlambric loading system began to fail me. I returned it but I will order another one."
"I arrive with battery at 91% not a single scratch seems new, a bargain the price very very happy with the purchase"
"The product is perfect, although the first time I ordered it they sent me some wet wipes and I had to ask for my refund, the customer service from Amazon is perfect. I bought it again and finally came the product I asked for. The phone came with 93 battery but I hope that with the weeks of use it will caliber and increase. The aesthetic is impeccable in my case and everything working in order. Super recommended, but for you to make the purchase it tracks the lowest price and be patient!"
"The truth was that I distrusted the refurbished teams, but I've already been with my team for a couple of weeks and it really feels like new. It arrived well, quickly, without conflict, with very good aesthetics. Super recommended."
"In the mica that brings up much of the scratches that brings the screen, it will change but will be many problems for the information that I have already put to the phone, you have to take more care of the aesthetics of the screens of these phones, why while they are used they must manage quality in them."
"I have only been in use for a week, but the phone as new as it is completely, both physically and functionally. I highly recommend it, it came with 100% battery, without any physical detail and released for any company (I use Telcel) has Apple care in force of one month from delivery (at least so in my case)."
"I liked that the team came with an excellent presentation. If I had brought original charger it would have been 10 out of 10"
"Face ID not working"
"The team came to me with 87 battery is very well taken care of, I was afraid to buy it for some reviews but I recommend it 100%"
"In perfect aesthetic and functional conditions. Battery status in 91%. It came with cable and charger (generic) that work very well. I have been with the phone for 1 week, until now everything ok."
"I arrive in time and shape!! It looks cute!! Obviously it is renewed do not expect that the aesthetic is 10 but if it reaches the 9 screen and back 10 without scratches the obvious shore is the one that has small pekeños but everything perfect!! The happy truth works at 100I had a normal 11 pro but I wanted the biggest screen! But I do not plan to spend a million on the new 12 is a scam that is why I decided to buy the 11proMax and I like it very much!! Cameras loudspeakers alloooo!! It works well!!I will use it and then update them I hope it does not present failures!!No original box does not bring hearing aids and the charger is generic but it is 2.1 and compatible is appreciated!! I put photo!!I am happy with the purchase!!Good price-quality!!!"
"The cell phone looks like new! It arrived perfectly packed. I am very happy with my purchase. Until today it works perfectly and gives me a lot of peace of mind that has a guarantee of a year! I wanted to hope to try it to give my review and if I would buy it again because thus we contribute to care our environment! It feels like new!"
"I've been using it for a week, all right so far, the battery came with 100% conditions, no details, no scratches. brought cable and charger."
"The iPhone comes with 91% battery without scratches or strokes, definitely excellent purchase."
"Good price."
"It is understood that it is a reconditioned product and it is not entirely new, but at least in my case, it came to me with a screen with enough small scratches (the previous owner sure left it with the screen on the floor) and in the description says that they should not be practically null or null.What I did not like is that they try to hide it by putting a protective mica so that it seems that it does not have scratches, and it is something misleading.It is not bad product but in my opinion I recommend that if they buy it, they remove that mica to see the real conditions in which they send it."
"The Media Could Not Be Loaded. I loved it from start to finish!!! I can't believe that even if it is renovated it has the battery 100% and with no aesthetic detail, it even comes with a mica and it has never opened because it still has the seal against the water (verified with the barometer) and all its parts are obviously original (verified with a program, the battery only tenka 30 cycles) for a lot less money than it costs, it's really amazing"
"I loved it from start to finish!!! I can't believe that even if it is renovated it has the battery 100% and with no aesthetic detail, it even comes with a mica and it has never opened because it still has the seal against the water (verified with the barometer) and all its pieces are obviously original (verified with a program, the battery only tenka 30 cycles) for far less money than it costs, it is truly amazing"
"The cell phone was totally blocked as if it were new, it came with generic accessories as the description says, aesthetically it has an 8 out of 10"
"Good product looks new"
"The phone arrived in time and form. It’s like new in terms of aesthetics and functioning."
"I arrived with a blow on the metal frame that left a mark as a bubble type near the camera in addition to several deep scratches , it brought a mica of glass poorly placed, for the price and in that state it was not worth it"
"For the question of price quality I give you a 10, I've been using it for more than 4 months and it's working for perfeccion and without details."
"At first I was afraid that the product would not arrive, for cases that have occurred, or that the product would be bad until it was original, but all excellent, the equipment seems new, without faults"
"I thought it was good product, it came to me with 87 and I had a medium use the normal and I could endure the day and if it happened I would carry it"
"I've changed my address many times when you order this iPhone, but it was delivered to my old direction and it makes me a lot of trouble. I mean Amazon's service has problems. iPhone is excellent."
"The team arrived practically new, very good purchase. Only the stack would have liked it to arrive like the previous one up 92%, this one arrived at 85%. But everything excellent."
"Excellent compra reached me today to 91% of life and Literal seems new I hope and have no problems later I loved"
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, aesthetically 10/10, and in terms of the operation everything very well."
"The team well! I came a bit scratched thing that is not notified, but out of that it has no problem or problem, with the savings that I had sincerely I am satisfied. I already have some time with the phone and I have no problem, except for the scratches! The phone is the maximum like all the apple products"
"At least to me, my device arrived with a deep rallion and percentage of battery at 88%. When I contacted to return it because I didn’t want to have it like that, I was only offered 10 USD as compensation"
"Without scratches, the color and capacity chosen, aesthetically as new, without blows or scratches, the battery 86%, without box, comes charger and generic cable, but for the price, highly recommended, reached me in 2 weeks or little less."
"I arrived with quality of 9 because I only had a few minimum scrapes on the banks, the pile arrived with 85 so it seems very good, I have been trying it for 4 days and I do not regret the purchase the battery lasts me all the excellent day!!"
"Aesthetics of 100, as new, recommended."
"I sincerely expected less and surprised me 512 GB in perfect condition pulling perfect, 97% battery all working perfectly, all right cameras all excellent! Cable and generic charging center but for the price save those luxuries and compensate it with 512 GB I find excellent !"
"I use it for everything, the best thing is that I could accommodate one line of att in the form of a virtual chip, and another of telcel in the physical chip, and I no longer require two devices. I am really very happy with the equipment, excellent photos and videos as well"
"Aesthetic at 100, good quality price. No complaints."
"Okay, but it came in a little scratchy."
"Being a remanufactured product I was aware that I would have some wear and tear or defects. Unfortunately, as I uncovered it, I had the unpleasant surprise that it was quite scratched from the screen and had several hits on the banks of the metal frame as well as on the cameras. The scratches were too deep. Unfortunately, I was out of my home for a long time. So when I returned and checked the Product I lost the return time. I ended up spending more on changing the damaged Glass on the phone. The condition of the battery reached 87% and to date it has been maintained. Personally I did not buy renewed again."
"I arrive with 87% battery not bad and only a few ralls on the screen with the mica does not notice anything for the price is good"
"The charger I came with only worked 1 month, and I stop serving you and you buy another, I think you should check out the extra components very well. The phone if I fill all my expectations"
"It's good product only that some primordial applications like whatsaop get stuck and slow to open"
"The phone is excellent as if it were new, you don't notice the difference, and it has 92 percent performance in the battery."
"Everything perfect a few slight brands of use in the area of cameras but aesthetic of 9.5 I would say, I arrive with 100% battery life, I will have to return it because my bank does not respect the promotion of reimbursement in state of account :( it is a pity but if I recommend it"
"Physically arrived in excellent condition, without a single rayon. Perfect operation. It’s how new."
"The screen was very grated, these scratches affected the front camera and the battery life was very bad"
"I had my doubts about being an Amazon renewed product but I took a risk and it was a good decision, arrived in excellent conditions Highly recommended"
"The aesthetic of 9.5 quite good condition the product, the battery completely exceeded my expectations."
"I'm surprised how well preserved I got, so far without any detail. The only bad thing is the charger and cable."
"It's a used equipment so the battery doesn't reach 100, but other than that it works wonderfully, physically it has almost no detail, the box, the cable and the charger are generic but for the price is very good"
"At first the phone arrived with scratches is normal because it is renewed and because it is obvious that someone else used it, but just yesterday I no longer pull the Face ID and it came out a green stripe to the screen and it turns off and turns on the screen when it wants how good it can process the refund since Amazon gives you 90 days of guarantee. I hope the others if they have done very well their equipment is only my particular case."
"After 15 days of continuous use it works as a new product"
"The only detail you have against is a battery with 85% life, otherwise, great phone"
"The product is in very good condition, without any scratch or stroke, it is in a condition of 10 and the battery reached me with 99% , although not everything was quite well since days before I had ordered the color space gray and lost me the package, although that was already a question of the parcel but as for the phone I had my doubts for comments that I read and the truth is that I do not regret, until now everything working well and perfectly"
"The equipment came to me in impeccable condition. It looks like new, has no aesthetic details. It works perfectly. It came to me with 98% battery life. Recommended to 100."
"Excellent supplier is the third team I ask with the same supplier"
"The excellent product, unfortunately I was assaulted, I would like to know if you can provide me with the number of imei to block it please. Thank you"
"It's very good!!"
"You have your reservations when you make this kind of purchases, however every time the suppliers are getting better and that's the joke that they are giving more and more confidence. It's the second time I do it, the time I spent with Iphone 8, it was fine, but this time, it was better for me. I hope you have even, a better experience."
"Very sad pr than a year after the computer was running, the screen stopped responding without any cause."
"It took me long to write the review to see if the iPhone had any flaws and to this day everything incredible, I arrived with good battery (99%) without any imperfection (raptures, stains or blows) unlocked for any company and without problems with iCloud. In a nutshell perfect."
"Only for the battery but excellent the truth. I still last long enough for the charge."
"I arrive with your generic box and charger, but the equipment physically at 100, battery at 100, delivery time next day, msi."
"The device came as new with a battery at 89%, you can only appreciate a few small scratches on the screen near the camera, however, out of that detail it looks like a new phone, the charger is generic and the truth did not give me much confidence, I preferred to use the one already had."
"The iPhone arrived well, works well, aesthetic 10/10 but arrived with 90% battery :/"
"I am very happy with the purchase, the cell phone arrived in excellent condition, the days have passed since I bought it and I am 100% satisfied. I must say that when it came to me, I was not very happy because it did not come in its original box or its accessories, since opening an iphone in its packaging is also a great experience."
"The truth was doubtful if I would buy it, but I was pleasantly surprised, it has no detail of aesthetics, the performance is perfect, the battery comes to 100%It has certainly been a very good purchase.In addition they have months without interest and arrived sooner than I expected."
"I have two weeks using it. It came in another package but that’s the least, since so far it has worked wonderfully and even reached me with the protective screen mica as extra, being that they cost very expensive. I would definitely buy reconditioned products again on Amazon. Totally a 100% ecological purchase. I do not regret the purchase."
"The media could not be loaded. I hope it was just bad luck. The iPhone was spotless even bringing a mica for the screen and with 94% condition. I set it up and used it for a week. I had had a bit of trouble with Telcel’s signal but it was fixed only (who knows how). The problem was that a week later the screen went green, then it took off and I felt relief, but it went green again and so it was green. I liked it very much but I had to return it. Fortunately I could erase my data. I was waiting for the refund. I bought others and I had never passed this from the green screen."

I had really liked it but I had to return it. Fortunately I could erase my data. I was waiting for the refund. I bought others and I had never passed this from the green screen."
"The product came without aesthetic details, working optimally, including the 89% face id and stacked. However, by updating to iOS 15 it found that the screen was not the original one. It is a screen that was not even OLED."
"Well the phone, its battery with 89% but well and careful to be renovated without problems of operation or other things I recommend, the price well to months and cobla confidence that Amazon answers you"
"I consider that if the price was somewhat high."
"The truth was what I expected, it exceeded my expectation as I arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled, I called the attention that the cell phone already came even with tempered glass protector, of course that I would buy again, knowing that they are good products and above all guaranteed, if you save a few thousand pesos in Mexico regarding its NEW value."
"The iPhone gets very hot when it is used and comes with a glass mica, takes it off to put a mica mate and what was my surprise “THE RAYED AND TALLED PANTAL” has many scratches and heels, they put the mica to disguise its state. I’m about to return it"
"The team arrived with what it indicates, how the screen is very grated, which was tried to cover with a glass protector."
"I liked it very much, I arrived in very good condition, the battery at 90% and with protective glass. It does not include charger or original box, but for the cost and promotion of MSI it is worth it!"
"I had my doubts since I have always bought things directly in apple, the truth very well the performance and aesthetics of 100, I have been a month with him and everything in order, I arrive with 94% in battery life! Good purchase to my mind"
"I liked it very much, it came in excellent condition and with a 94% battery, with a mica and no scratches of anything."
"I had my doubts reviewing all the comments but in the end it cheers me up and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the product, no punch or scratch also came to me with the condition of stack of 98%, it is worth it and if you do not like the way it comes you can always return it"
"Luxury, I highly recommend it!"
"A real pity when it comes to opening the package, you're always looking forward to releasing a new or used team but the illusion became frustrating to see that only instructions came from the refurbished team and a generic charger, I think it's a serious disrespect to do that kind of thing and I don't justify it in any way, the only good thing about all this was that if I got the refund, 20 days after the purchase and I had no cell phone and no money for those long 20 days of distress, I hope and serve you this comment and you don't have the same thing happen to you."
"Excellent value for money"
"The phone really looks new, except the detail of the battery that brings an 86% capacity and that brings protective mica (which obviously a new computer does not bring), the phone is impeccable. I have 10 months with it and everything goes well."
"It came as new; it has no scratches in the housing or on the screen, it works very well, the battery came with 95% of its operation."
"I'm in good shape."
"The equipment arrived in excellent condition, the box without any defects and the accessories (generic) in the same way without any defects. It arrived with an aesthetic 10/10, without any front or rear rayon. The battery life reached 96% The equipment works excellent, made its update of IOS without any problem. A purchase that was worth every penny and the equipment is practically new."
"Excellent battery, aesthetic just a few slight hits on the screen but there is in newer I liked very much"
"The product arrived in excellent aesthetic conditions, except for a detail on the screen (a small rayon)."
"The cell phone arrived before the estimated time, it is in perfect condition and everything as promised. Highly recommended!"
"Meet my expectations regarding the price. Good conditionsBattery at 98A slight scratch on the screen but out of that fine"
"excellent, I arrived well packaged although with some labels badly glued but to see that was the least since I arrived well piled to 100% without features of use, the vdd is very satisfied of the purchase!!"
"I got an equipment completely in excellent condition, visually and internally, the battery has 100% quality so delighted.It was a counter equipment, but little manipulated.I arrived in conditions again, zero scratches, zero strokes!, without hesitation I would buy it again."
"It didn't bring any aesthetic details and on the screen not on the back, and as the publication says it doesn't bring original accessories and the battery came to me with 84%, very good purchase"
"THE TELEPHONE CALLS ON THE 3 MONTHS, THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF GUARANTEE OR ANYTHING, TAKES HIM TO REPLACE AND DOESN'T SERVE THE BASEBAND, UNSERVED FOR ALWAYS"
"I liked that the team still had Apple care, which had mica and had no visible stroke, I didn't like that it didn't come to 100 the battery and that it didn't have its original charger and cable since the price given by the team is high little more and you buy the 12 Max pro"
"The cell phone came to me with scratched cameras, scratched screen and the worst with the loudspeakers covered with dirt, so much dirt that nothing is heard when I speak on the phone. I expected more than Amazon quality standards."
"The cell phone works perfectly and has no details. At least I haven’t found it. As they mention the battery status obviously isn’t 100% but by functional issues everything is excellent."
"An excellent purchase. The equipment arrived as new, only without its original box and original accessories, as even with a mica that 5 months later still retained. It arrived with 7 months warranty still (Apple care), battery at 97% and brings new product serial number, not of renewed. Recommended 100%, I have been 5 months with the"
"I arrive with 100% battery and with scratches the screen... after a month of use with maniatic care and charging with new original charge, under the condition of battery to 93%, rare truth? At least that they put it generical battery or something similar ... alfinal decided to return it, I don't want to think with how much comes percentage after the year of use..."
"I am very surprised with the product. It is my first purchase of a reconditioned in Amazon and the truth came out very good. The iPhone has aesthetics of 10, I arrived with good percentage of battery. It looks new literal. I recommend the seller and the product. The only thing that I did not like were the chargers since in the announcement it came out with the original chargers."
"It's cheap but you risk a lot, I got bad luck. The screen when tilting the cell phone shows non-original colors and is not of the same image quality"
"You can't tell it was a renewal, everything works 100%."
"I was nervous because I was getting a very cheap price, as well as reading reviews that they could come without serving or scratches, but still I decided to take the risk. I couldn’t have made a better decision, it’s impeccable. Not a single rayon and its battery at 100%."
"Very father. Excellent photos. Fast and great"
"It is what they offer, I arrive before the planned, very good purchase and very good product.Congratulations to the company"
"I loved the phone, excellent conditions, 97% battery, delivery in the specified time, responded to my concerns very quickly, I recommend it very much!"
"It comes as indicated, the iPhone in excellent condition, with established specifications, battery life to 100. The cable and charger is generic as set. The bad thing is that the charger is very low amperage and takes an eternity to charge, I believe by putting generic charger could include a fast charging one."
"The phone came in very good condition, only tiny scratches on the screen, the rest of the phone was like new. No internal part has been changed and its battery was at 95%. The only bad thing is the charger that includes, is generic, I do not recommend it to be used, as it could damage the battery. And I already have two months with it and it works perfectly !"
"The cell phone is spotless, it has no visible physical damage, it arrived super fast and even now it has not had any faults of any kind. The stack is at 92%I think it is very worth it I am very happy with my purchase."
"the phone arrived in perfect condition, impeccable the bad thing about buying that type of phone is that they are not equipped with the frequency of 28 mobile data, which is necessary to support phone companies as it is bait, pillofon, the megacable, etc, you limit yourself only to telcel, att, unefon and those of that style, if you don't care about those more economic phones, it is a very good option"
"I was really terrified of buying a reconditioning cell phone but I've been using it for two weeks now and I haven't had the slightest problem. The phone didn't have any aesthetic or functional details. 99% battery and it doesn't bring original cables or hearing aids but honestly if that's why it's going to cost half, I don't have any problem. Excellent shopping! I'd do it again."
"I arrive in perfect condition, as new!"
"I arrive in good condition and with more than 90% stack in general good purchase only that does not come with original charger and comes in generic box"
"To be used and okay, it came to me with 90% battery life, a little bit of scratches but it works well"
"Very good truth only small details but it's normal"
"I arrived from Estetica of 10, but the screen if it was very grated I put a glass mica and problem solved but a month began to fail me the Face ID and I had to return it, how strange that the next day they were already selling it again because they had it as a product exhausted, not if it was coincidence or it earned them that it failed and put it again for sale"
"The butria reached 85%, after 2 weeks it went down to 84%. It had two circular marks on the screen that were noticed against light. The holes look dirty. It warmed up a lot and half tarnished the crystal mica. The performance and function was correct But I did not like the heating and so many physical details. Fortunately this option to return. I really expected more."
"The product is like new, works 100%. It comes in a generic packaging with a generic charger and generic charging cable, but the phone is 100% original and comes very well protected."
"It's okay the phone without problems, the only bad thing are the accessories."
"I bought it and the day I checked it the camera and the horn were not good. It came with several scratches too obvious.It came in a box like egg Jajaja should have a better presentation so that the cell phone is not damaged anymore.The only good thing was that Amazon reimbursed me the payment without problem."
"It has faults on the screen and suddenly the phone does not react, which became visible from the third month of use"
"It came completely new. With 100% maximum battery, I feel very satisfied with my purchase, it doesn’t have a single scratch, it works all 100. Only the charger and the cable if they are super chafas, but around the cell phone this new one."
"It comes super careful, no detail and came to me with 96% battery, the bad thing is that it comes with a generic cable and no cube."
"Personally I do not like that all over the frame has details, especially because it mentions that they will not be seen one hand away, but it looks. Plus. It does not distinguish so much in photo but in person yes. I think I would not ask for another."
"At first I doubted whether to buy a refurbished phone or not but finally I was encouraged and the vdd is that I do not regret it, the phone arrived in perfect condition and in time, it only has one or two small scratches on the screen but in the day to day they do not notice, everything works perfect, I have a few days with the device and everything is excellent."
"I thought it was an excellent purchase."
"The phone works without problems.The bad thing is that the screen came with many scratches.In fact it had a protector on it so that one did not notice.Also it has as black plumon indelible in the frame of the phone."
"It fascinated me, totally looks like new, super tiny scratches on the banks that are hardly seen, perfect conditions so far everything perfect, charge very fast and has 99% life battery  I charmed, so far perfect"
"I doubted about buying a reconditioned phone, but this one overwhelms all my expectations."
"The order arrived two days earlier than announced, the phone is completely impeccable one would think it is new. The battery has 93% but it is Perfect!, the delivery method is great with its Amazon Renewed direct box"
"Excellent product, came to me with battery of %98The only complaint would be with the cable and charger that took a long time to charge.It brought mica and not a single detail of blows or wear.I highly recommend it"
"It is a good product, arrived without any aesthetic damage, with battery life to 92% and functionally I have no complaints. Recommended!"
"The battery has a 90% usage which is not bad for the model, the accessories only comes the charger and is not original, but for the price is a good product"
"Very good purchase"
"Excellent product!!!I had my doubts about the label “renewed” but it was worth every penny.Product without aesthetic details and with 96% battery, the only bad point I would put it is the charger since it is not the original but for the price I can not complain"
"So far, without any problems, it has worked 100%. Practically impeccable, a single detail on the screen, but really imperceptible."
"Recommended by the seller, the phone came with 100% battery and even with screen protector.A few details on the frames but nothing considerable.It is part of luck but much influence the reviews of the seller."
"I arrived in perfect condition with 97% battery all perfect"
"It arrived very scratched from the sides but nothing that a good case does not solve, in terms of functionality everything perfect and the pile to 97%."
"The quality of the stack, I'm barely two months old and I've got 90% taken care of when I load it."
"The screen comes very scratched and deep scratches"
"He doesn't bring the tray where the chip is placed and he has some scratches on the screen the generic accessories and the same box in the description said he looked like new that's fake."
"The cell phone comes in excellent condition, almost as new. It didn’t come with any scratches or anything, it includes screen mica and the battery status was 92% and it still lasts a lot. I’m very happy with the purchase."
"The cell phone arrived in good condition, its battery above 90%, so far running the equipment at 100. Without hesitation I would buy it again with this seller."
"I've only been with him for a couple of weeks, but I don't have any complaints right now. The phone's in excellent condition."
"The cell phone got hit, I decided to keep it because it is a heavy expense and I have no way to check that the cell phone had arrived hit and it had not been me. I realized until I took it out of the package. I bought a similar cell phone at Walmart and everything was excellent, I decided to give the seller the opportunity on Amazon, but they totally failed."
"I expected a little more aesthetics on the team, it arrives scratched and with blows it is understandable for the price but to be honest if you are already going to invest in this team put it a little more and buy a new one, I would have done it."
"I just got here, I already installed everything, I'm using it and I give it a 100/100. It came perfect aesthetics too."
"This iphone came with a small scratch a little visible on the bottom left and the battery at 93% overall all well, but it went off."

"I really liked that I received an almost impeccable team in physical conditions."
"The phone is in perfect condition, does not bring any details and I loved the transparency of the publication"
"What I don't like is that I can't buy you any data packets, they're reduced plans and they're more expensive."
"The device I received in excellent external condition just as its operation is excellent has been a purchase that has left me very satisfied regarding profit price thanks"
"In general fine but I had 2 scratches on the screen quite noticeable so I chose to return it, I still WAITING FOR MY RETURN..."
"Good product better than I expected"
"Excellent. I liked, 100% stack, as the aesthetics a 10"
"Good quality, good priceJust a few scratches on screen, the rest impeccable, 100% good performance"
"The cell phone looked perfect until I tried to turn it on. I noticed that the ignition button was half-deep and I had to press it more than normal to respond. This is a very obvious flaw. I was disappointed that this failure was not detected by Amazon as indicated in the description of its Reconditioned products where they claim to check the products earlier. It’s a shame since the rest of the team was in very good condition. I’ll return it immediately as I can’t accept it."
"I had to return it the same day it came to me, I bought it earlier with BuySpry (in another account) and I had never gone wrong, however this equipment was getting very hot using WhatsApp alone and had ghost touches. However I just ordered another team with them."
"They should be more rigorous in their quality standards of renewed products in Mexico since this problem did not happen to me with U.S. products, nothing recommended, is the second that I have to return"
"It comes in excellent condition, the vdd doesn't seem recovered and so far everything works super well"
"Aesthetics of 10, without scratches, the only detail that has 91% battery capacity but I think very good for the price and be renewed, very good way to save and get some quality"
"They arrive in very good condition, only it takes me a while to get there..."
"It arrived the next day. Aesthetically it is almost perfect, holding it at a distance of 10 cm is imperceptible any defect. I have used it about a month as my main phone and has not had any fault, the battery lasts approximately 48 hours."
"Super recommended, zero aesthetic details appreciable, battery in more than 85%, the included accessories are bad, but sure you have at home if you make this purchase. The particular iPhone that was sent to me even has still current coverage of AppleCare+!!!! I do not regret this purchase at all."
"I arrive in perfect condition, and battery life at 89%, of 10!"
"The product arrived in excellent condition and even with tempered glass mica and all the thing, battery to 99 and not a rayon on the body or screen, I am happy with my purchase"
"In perfect condition, aesthetic of 10 had only a small detail on one edge. % battery life with 94, arrived at the time mentioned, and the cell phone came with a protective mica."
"The phone came flawless I have a few days using it and everything has been great shopping!"

"Practically new"
"The phone is in excellent condition, without any damage and works well, I have already used it for several months.The battery is 90% and lasts all day without problem."
"The media could not be loaded. Well it was a flying that expected to win haja, 94% stack, but I think it is considerably mistreated, which was not noticed with tempered glass, yet I will take the decision to give it a chance to the functioning of the team waiting for it to be the optimal."
"Well, it was a blowout that I was hoping to win, 94% stack, but I think it's considerably mistreated, which wasn't noticeable with the tempered glass, yet I'm going to take the decision to give the team a chance to run waiting for it to be the optimal."
"It's not worth it. The cell phone came to me in very good condition and working perfect, at 2 months the Face ID stopped working and to repair it you have to invest another 5,000 pesos. Don't buy it."
"It came as new, it works all including the Face ID, with a 92% condition in the battery which I think is perfect. I have already been with him for 1 month and has not failed anything and the screen looks excellent. It is a very good purchase for the price."

"I love it, the phone looks new. Battery life of 95% wooow!!"
"EXCELLENT PRODUCT LIVED 4 MONTHS WITH HIM AND HAVE NO FALL TOGETHER WITH 91% KILL"
"Don't buy BuySpry, on the edges I had bumps and scrapes, just as I came with a glass mica to cover deep scratches on the display, regarding the price it makes me very unfair because at first sight the equipment had already been used for a long time. in the description it mentions that it is in good condition but it is not so."
"Excellent condition equipment, only a few small bolts of daily use on the bottom, excellent screen and battery with capacity of 93%It arrives in generic box, as well as charger and cable. It does not contain hearing aids.Enchanting with the product."
"The product comes in impeccable conditions, although it is an item of use not noticed, the battery came to 91%, includes a charger and came with the glass mica for protection, is an excellent product"
"I really liked the iPhone, as new without any scratches. 94% battery"
"The screen was very scratchy and that affects the value of the product even more"
"All perfect !!"
"Not a scratch, face id works well, all as new. The only detail is the 95% stack that for that 5% vs. new you save almost 10,000 pesos. Suuper recommended"
"I got missed from the camera."
"In general everything very well, only that comes a generic charger and another box not the original of the equipment"
"The media could not be loaded. I do not recommend buying this type of equipment, you risk not getting it as it was my case. The box came only with the generic charger and a charging cable, plus the box where the phone would supposedly be was broken from the ""security seal"", definitely save yourself the trouble whether it comes to nothing or the equipment gets in bad shape, go to the safe and buy something new."

"He served me about three and a half months and then he started shutting himself out of nowhere, I went to fix it and they told me he had his battery disconnected and then he turned off and he didn't want to turn it on anymore."

"Don’t buy Amazon’s refurbished devices, mine stopped working after 3 months of purchase, took it to an authorized apple center and told me that I had hardware problems (I didn’t have any physical problems) so I had to communicate with Amazon directly, however they comment that the warranty expired and there’s nothing they can do. They should check that the equipment they sell is devices with reliability and not equipment that after 3 months will stop serving. Very disappointing customer attention and product quality."

"I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. The phone aesthetic is 10, the maximum battery capacity indicates 100% and so far its operation is excellent. The phone arrived without the original box and charger but I still give it an excellent rating. I definitely recommend this seller."

"Very good product,"

"Very good price although the accessories are of very low quality"
"I returned it because the screen is not the original, if it was remanufactured it should be with original pieces. You ask them and they say they cannot know what was done to the cell phone, then what do they know? The lady of the tianguis knows more about what she sells than they do."
"All perfect 100% battery"
"It didn’t come in the original box, it didn’t contain original cable or charger, it was compatible. The screen looked pretty good, without scratches, but on the sides if it had enough stems and blows. I was willing to keep it so everything worked well and quite normal compared to a new one, even the battery.

"Sub menus fail I have to cancel and return to the procedure to send attachments via WhatsApp or email"
"Many details of use. I even brought a mica to the front to hide the scratches. On this occasion if it was a team with many details. I already returned it."

The other came with visible marks, on screen and frames, more battery at 83%, the truth expected more, both work well, but I think the 2nd iPhone was more to get into state ""very good"", not in excellent. I don't know what the limit will be to qualify it here or there... It disillusioned me a bit."
"I had little scratches on the screen, but it works well."
"The phone's fine."
"Immediate delivery and all-okay product"
"If it is working correctly"
"Everything's fine, but the battery's a little worn out."

The rest so far very well. Aesthetically I will give 90%, I brought a rayon that only looks well, I brought the protective glass; I had already read all the reviews, and they say that when they put glass in it is that it is scratched the screen, it is minimal only if you check it well almost with magnifying glass, you can see it The battery came in 84% Within everything goes very well, and I hope it goes on like this for a long time."

"Well, actually, the iPhone arrived in very good condition, I recommend it."
"I like a lot of good investment"
"In general the cell phone works very well, I have been with 3 months and until now everything works perfectly, in aesthetics the cell phone had a few small scratches on the screen but nothing that affects and to see them you must see it in detail, in the day to day they do not notice, the condition of the battery reaches 87, which until now after 3 months it remains the same."
"The team arrived in very good condition (although the outer box was badly mistreated) and for me luck out of a couple of taps on the banks, the battery reached 100 and the quality of the camera is excellent as in the picture of the puppy."
"Good evening, sincerely highly recommended, it reached 100, aesthetic 99, only a very small rayon back, the screen at 100, the battery at 100, when they send it to you they send a key so that that key will be given to the parcel store, yes , the delivery man told me that you have to check the product at the moment why to a person did not arrive anything that at the moment he asked me to check to see that the product is there , waited for me to serve them my summary, greetings from Cordoba Veracruz, living Mexico"
"Good to be a reconditioned cell phone, I arrived in good condition and it works well.One detail to consider is the battery, which is at maximum capacity of 82% I came with some small scrapes and to put the sim card beatle even though it comes with key."
"Battery at 79"
"It came to me with 83% battery and it’s working well. Physically the phone is super good, it doesn’t have a single detail and I liked it. The box where they send it to you is generic but the important thing is the content. Finally what I didn’t like was that the charger they send you is generic and I’m not really sure how good it is to charge it with less watts than the original charger indicates, I would have liked it at least had the original cable. But from there on out all cool, if I recommend it."
"In general, it was a good purchase! I recommend itThe right price and I was lucky enough that it arrived with 100% battery. Everything works wonderfully and I had no problem to configure it, it comes unlocked as the description. The charger fulfills, without being splendid.One by one... Just as the battery came 100%, unfortunately the screen and the back are very scratched. The screen protector that had installed was not very good, so I changed it for a mica of hydrogel. The back had no protection, so I put a mica of hydrogel on it. The scratches are quite visible (I apologize for not showing it well for the mica).For the price and user experience, it seems to me a good purchase and already with micas installed the rayons pass practically unnoticed."
"I got the phone within 2 days.It has like 2 imperceptible bolts, with battery at 87% and works perfect.I recommend the purchase"
"I arrived with minor details in the aesthetics, the battery came in 89% and had no problem. The only detail is that the charger they sent me did not work, from then on it was a very good purchase."
"It's pretty good the only bad thing that's got two little scratches of everything else is pretty good."
"I came literal as new has no scratch or punch, with 100% battery capacity, box and charger that are generic, brought a protective plastic and also came with frost on, I recommend"
"It came perfect 4 days after ordering itIt came with 87% of life, the screen brings glass mica already put intact, without any rayon. It was a good purchase. I recommend the seller (eye, they are not new, they are Rea conditioned and brings generic charger but I have no problem."
"The phone arrived the day I was told, arrived very well packaged and its charger without details , the only detail that I notice is in the lower corner that does not affect in its function, cameras, sound, vibration, the battle true ton, all well so far, the condition of battery reached me 83% nothing bad I hope it will last me at least one charge per day, but satisfied because it arrived me in good condition and with the guarantee that promise of 90 days."
"Wonderfully everything, the charger was generic, but from there I liked everything."
"aesthetic 10 of 10, the battery at 95%, the price is what I liked the most ;)"
"The product came with what it promises, a simple packaging, with warranty, charger and cable type Lightning and of course the iPhone, which is without a single scratch, has all the functions and specifications chosen, Face ID, True Tone, unlocked for any company and with a good quality protective mica. Happy with the purchase, I would do it again."
"The cell phone arrived excellent. Without any scratch on the screen, back or bank. It arrived with 100% battery condition and was upgraded to iOS 16 after the first configuration."
"I bought it because I have more than 5 years passed from iOS to Android and wanted to try without spending so much that such I was going back to the block. As was to be expected the pretty good experience with iOS, intuitive, agile and very well cleaned (not like my Xioami and its very bad interface MIUI full of bugs, which was basically what made me turn back to iPhone).On the other hand this reconditioned iPhone arrived with an almost perfect aesthetic, only a scratch on the screen that was not very visible to the naked eye. The big problem was the maximum battery capacity, as a sample in the photos of 77%, and in the specifications of Amazon renewed says it should be a minimum of 80%. Besides that personally I feel that the touch was left to duty, I felt that I had a lag. I ended up making the return for the theme of the stack and touch, zero problems and excellent attention from the salesman TELMOV. I recommend it: Yes, but I still look for a renewed the recent ones, I hope they will serve my review and photos."
"Very good item, good price, only the battery life is at 80%."
"The phone is in perfect condition. I received it with battery capacity to 86%"
"It's the first time I buy a renewed iPhone. An aesthetic of 8.5 could say... it has no scratches on the back or on the banks but it does on almost the whole screen, like 3 that do notice a little and the others see them when you look at them in detail but with a mica of hydrogel no longer noticed, I found the first defect in the charger, it turns out that the cube no longer worked from the first attempt to charge it, and finally the battery that reached me with an 88%, I arrive on Monday 29 November and today 2 December the battery low to 87%... maybe it was already going to come down but I will have it in observation and take care of the battery, if it comes down more in a short time I think I will return it."
"The phone came aesthetically new, because of the exception of the scratched screen and with a mica to balance it, however when I lit it the person for whom it was (it was a gift) realized that in the upper right corner had a very noticeable stain of humidity which should not happen if the cell phone has IP68; I checked it and it had already been opened. It had no residue of glue on the back cover, on edges. We thought someone bought it again, changed the screen for his that was damaged and returned it, entering as renewed. I do not understand how Amazon sells those orders ""revised by its quality technicians"" but well, it returned only for that. In itself the cell phone was a 9 without that detail that was very noticeable."
"It's very good and it didn't scratch me or anything."
"Everything as advertised the cell phone came looking almost new in very good condition"
"The product is practically good, I arrived 2 days ago and it works without problem, I arrive with 85% battery. It should be noted that if it came a bit scraped from the corners and from the back it has marks from a cover that cannot be removed, and from the 2 speakers from the bottom it only works 1, it was to be expected because the product is not new, but it does not affect its functioning, even so it continues to be heard well, as for the rest it works perfect Face ID to 100 and all the cameras of the same way, as for the battery it lasts me approximately 8hrs of normal use. In conclusion I have read other comments and it is a coin to the air to buy this, so much it can be good or bad, question of luck, in my case I like the product and if I think to keep it until the moment it works well, update the review if something goes wrong afterwards, recommend to buy it only if you are not so demanding and do not have the resources to buy it, if you have 1000 times better to buy it again."
"The cell phone came with a generic charger and cable. The aesthetic is 9/10, with minimal usage marks. I took the computer to an Apple Store for a comprehensive diagnosis and it was only alerted in 2 components which specified that they could be solved with the iOS update. Bateria to 86% of service life after about 800 load cycles. For a ""renewed"" or use computer, I think it is acceptable and functional. As I test it, I will update if anything changes."
"When I got my cell phone I was super happy because I got spotless, without scratches, nor blows, the battery came to me with 96% practicing as new, however it did not come complete since I did not bring the tray of the SIM card, while I can not use the cell phone completely since I can not put Sim in what I get the tray:("
"The product looks new, 100% battery and with warranty on the mobile until the following year. Excellent product, would buy again with the seller."
"The only thing I don't like is that the battery goes down fast."
"good item for the at&T line but not compatible for megamobile, excellent care and good attention, I recommend it to not spend too much on expensive systems. the battery lasts a lot"
"The product arrived in good condition, minimal blows but they do not prevent the functionality of the product. I arrive with a battery of 86%."
"Quality and price"
"The only thing I didn't like was that it got with the battery to 86, it's within the expected range but I expected to be lucky. After using it a few months it went down very fast to 75 :("
"It is in excellent condition but it came to me with C-type charger when the one that the iPhones need is inning Lightning"
"Battery at 83%, screen with 3 small scratches, everything else works well so far."
"I didn't like that a bosin came out of the bottom and the others were heard very ugly, but don't return it because I already needed it."
"The battery came with 94% and it works perfectly. I recommend the purchase."
"I got good at aesthetics, only when we learned it arrived with 80% battery of the equipment, for in iphone that percentage of life is very little, more related to the price."
"It arrived on time and of good quality, arrived in generic box, with generic charger."
"A good gift for my son"
"Everything in order, battery, screen, operation, the only detail was that the vocina was dirty. It was taken to maintenance so that it was heard well."
"First find out exactly which seller of all available was the one that had the best reviews in the last months and days, then determine that the best was BuySpry. The phone came to me impeccable, battery to 100%, without aesthetic details, without problems like the unrecognized screen, lock by iCloud or recognition of the Sim, although it was not an original box evidently, still and so the box was of good quality, comes a generic charger and a usb cable to Lightning, besides that already the cell phone comes with a crystal mica (only I had to buy it a case, transparent and ready) I am very satisfied with this cell phone in fact is my first iPhone, I wanted to give it a chance since I acquired an iPad in December and I really liked its system, that same made me acquire some AirPods 3, and integration is at another level, there is really nothing in Android that can be compared to the IOS ecosystem. Fully recommended if you doubt that an iPhone 11 despite stopping your years is still a good team for the processor and the cameras maintains a good price-quality thanks to entering as a renewed product."
"Good price ratio quality"
"Very small details, it came with mica and surprisingly with 100% battery"
"It is in exelent conditions of 10 reasonable price within the market"
"High-end and well-functioning phone"
"According to the model I bought, the price seemed very good, the equipment arrived in perfect condition, with the battery at 100%, it has not failed almost 1 week, everything works well, I could link it without problem with my Apple Watch , brings a generic charger and cable as indicated in the description as well as a box not original, but it comes well packaged, I think it is a matter of luck, I risk myself and receive a product 98% new"
"The charger didn't work,"
"Very good product."
"The device came as new. Excellent presentation. Good extra details such as charger, cable and screen protective mica."
"As it appears in the photos and description 100%"
"In the description they guarantee that the equipment has a battery capacity greater than 80%, since this one that I have bought has 75%, less good that you can return it. At the reception of a rayon on the screen the aesthetics of the cell phone and other characteristics are perfect seemed new with the simple aesthetics to the"
"Excellent condition of the cell phone and battery was in incredible condition, I know it is restored only because so mentions the article. The quality of the product was very good."
"I bought it for my daughter, I'm on time and a year later a super cell phone."
"I got there earlier than expected.,at 100 battery health.,no scratches or marks.. practically as new and functional in everything,faceid,cameras.,speaker..Speakers etc .. very satisfied with the purchaseI was very lucky I considered that I got a nineth team .."
"To be reconditioned this super battery at 89%, arrived me long before the estimated date and the product zero scratches, totally satisfied with the purchase, quality price totally fair."
"The cell phone very well with a few scratches on the screen that were barely visible, what I dislike was the health of the battery as it came in 78%."
"It came to me long before it was specific and very well packed. It has small bolts of use, which is normal on a renovated phone, but it works well, already connect my smartwatch and Soundpeats brand bluetooth headphones and work perfectly. I had a detail with the initial update of the apps, but with a full phone reset was enough and so far it is working great.I update the review in about 3 months."
"Really a new team even if it's reconditioned."
"It came very well, a small scrape in a corner but hardly seen and also came with a glass mica, the stack at 85% very well, camera, facial lock, can be used with any cell company, very good purchase I recommend"
"It arrived on time, very carefully, without scratches, the battery with more than 80%. Only with a small detail on the button deactivate/activate doorbell but otherwise it works at 100."
"I arrive without any details, with 100% battery, a very good phone"
"The media could not be loaded. I liked it very much, so far it has worked very well. I have been with it for two weeks and excellent. As for the battery it reached 88% and in minimal wine design, I give it 9/10 It also came with box and generic charger but all good. Good purchase."
"I liked it very much, so far it has worked very well. I have been with him for two weeks and excellent. As for the battery reached 88% and in design came minimum, I give him 9/10 also came with box and generic charger but all good. Good buy."
"The cell phone came to me with 81% battery, this means that in a short time of use it will be necessary to make an urgent battery change (This to avoid the sudden battery basses using the computer) For example, use the computer one day and 26% battery step to 10% and then 6% and it went out. The computer also overheated repeatedly, the screen came scratched. I think for the price is not worth it."
"buy this product for the price and for the same reason I did not expect more, it has some aesthetic details but are not visible to the naked eye and the battery comes below 80%"
"The truth was that I hesitated a lot to buy a mobile phone Reaccomanded by the many reviews with bad experiences; even as it has been said, when making a purchase of this style it is a risky move. However, I have been absolutely satisfied with the purchase and extremely grateful to the seller. The phone arrived in one day. The aesthetic conditions are really impressive as it shows only minimal aesthetic details that only when you look at it carefully have to be noticed. It really seems totally new, as it came with 88% battery condition. It was perfectly packed and even with plastics to protect the phone; it even comes with tempered glass protection mica on the screen. I can really say that they have been one of the best purchases I have made and I must reiterate I am extremely grateful to the seller for such excellent shopping experience. Now it is only necessary to see if in the next few weeks it presents any flaws so I will update this review as I am using it."
"I'm having trouble with the purchases in love as it is that they announce it completely unscrambled and it's locked in the window of my taster so I can unblock it and it's going to cost me a thousand pounds."
"It arrived on time, super well packed, in perfect condition, I have been with him for about a week. It came with 81% battery, that would definitely be the only bad thing, however the phone works perfectly."
"This product I highly recommend, my phone I bought it 3 months ago and I wanted to write a review after this time, it does not have a fly skating and the system is excellent the pile came to me of 96% which I found very good for the price and I have no complaint hast the moment"
"I arrived without details I reached 10/10 and the battery at 87% the truth for the year that is the cell was made very well the truth 100% recommended"
"The phone arrived in very good condition The stack is at 87%, they changed the screen completely and in the settings section does not recognize it as original product But the phone pulls to perfection, comes without scratches, super careful"
"Everything has charmed me of this iPhone 11 yellow! It arrived on time, good product, had a scratch but small but nothing that affected the operation and practically invisible with the mica, the stack at 85% but it is not new so without complaints and I have already been with cell phone several months and I am still fascinated with the purchase, seller verified, checked and the sure thing is that I will continue to buy with him or her :)"
"The package arrived in time, very well packed, brings its charger and generic cable that work properly, the phone arrived without marks, blows or scratches on the back, edges and lenses of the cameras, the stack condition is 89%, works without problems, Face ID correct, True Tone correct, cameras work well, sound and vibration also work, this unlocked, the buttons in good condition, the only detail is that it has several scratches on the screen, that go beyond the normal wear of a computer and if they are visible to a arm of distance, it is put a mica and practically not seen, except one in the center of the screen, I decided to keep it, thinking that when changing it can arrive another with more details.And besides I was made up the equipment, however it is to take into account that the equipment if they have details of use and are visible, give more the impression of being used to be reconditioned, the products are expected to have signs of use but not with signs of abuse, I consider that Amazon should improve the quality control of its suppliers in these products"
"The product arrived very fast, well packaged, I did not find the key for sim, came with charger and cable (generic but functional) however after loading the equipment and proving it in the day I noticed a defect on the screen and had to return it, the price seemed acceptable to me, I had already bought this type of equipment ""refurbished"" and had no problems, I hope to find another equipment."
"The team came very well protected and the battery is above 95%, of aesthetics is 10."
"It has a 9/10 aesthetic (it has very slight scratches that do not affect the operation of the phone) although the battery arrived with an 86% battery condition I would have liked it to arrive with more."
"It arrived in excellent condition, only a small scrape on the bottom that is not noticeable. It works wonderfully."
"Everything went well fast delivery before time well packed and well product"
"The product arrived and comes as mentioned with a stack percentage of 80, and some aesthetic details, I'll be waiting for some detail, for now all good"
"Like many I had my doubts whether to buy the equipment or not. My first impressions of the aesthetics of the phone is a 7/10, it has 2 details on the screen, it does not affect the performance, but as in the purchases that I saw them cover them with a glass mica. Besides this has details on the edges, which are acceptable since it is a renewed computer. In question the percentage of battery reached me with 83%. In operation it fulfills very well, Apps, download, signal, video, sound etc. Another good point is that the computer is released. I will be updating based on my experience since although 83% is regular, I will continue to give it a normal use, I hope not to have to return it, but everything can happen."
"For the price is fine, although I would have liked a little more percentage of battery life"
"In general it fulfills what it says, although a lens came starry"
"Being refurbished teams you can be lucky or not. In my case a camera does not work and I have been trying to contact the team for more than a week to make the warranty valid. I bought from Amazon thinking that it would be easier the process (if required) but it is not. Keep in mind."
"The phone comes very well from aesthetics, the stack comes to 85 percent, which I expected to be used but came damaged from the horn, does not work, neither listen or listen to me when talking!"
"I arrive in very good condition and it works perfectly, the only bad thing is that the pile arrived with a 73% load capacity. When I finish the warranty of the phone, I will change it. It is still a good purchase, but not excellent."
"The phone brings a tempered glass, which hides the screen that is totally scratched, arrived with 85 percent battery life, out of that all excellent"
"It arrived on time and in good condition, it only has a small scrape on the bottom. Battery health at 90% and works well in all respects. The charger dice did not work, but the cable did, although it was not really a problem for me."
"Buying a cell phone of this type is always a lottery, you don’t know if you will get a good one or something that isn’t worth it. In my case my cell phone arrived in perfect condition and after 3 weeks of use I have no complaint in any sense. The only thing is that it reached me with 85% battery life but it is above the minimum that must reach you (80). Anyway the duration of the stack yields well. Good luck with your purchases."
"I was very afraid to buy a reconditioned phone, I had checked the iPhones for some time and read all the reviews and I saw all the photos, fearful and everything I decided to buy and I didn’t know what a good decision, it came in a generic box, I turned it on and the first thing I checked was the stack I couldn’t believe when I saw it bring it to 100, the scratched zero screen, everything working at 100. The only thing that scared me was that at first I didn’t download anything from the store app but I restarted it and started pulling super good. It’s really like I bought it as new, everything works super good, camera, flash, bluetooth, microphone, everything, not a single scratch under the mica. It should be taken into account that the same charger is generic but it works very well and everything works perfect for about 5 thousand pesos less (I bought it at 8200) SUPER BUYA"
"It is the product that promises, it has 88% battery life, loq eu seems acceptable to me for the price that was less than 10,000. It does not have scratches nor looks very used, it would give a 9.5 to the aesthetics of the casing and to the screen a 10, certainly. I do not put 5 stars because my line is Mexican with BAIT (part of Altán Redes) and it was not compatible, so I had to switch to another one with less Gigas of data a month. Anyway, it was not much difference to be able to use an iPhone 11. Similarly they billed without problems."
"Thanks to the company Amazon for supporting the suppliers of refurbished equipment. For me it is a guarantee that Amazon supports them. The team came as new."
"After battling with two purchases, the first never arrived (I was refunded to gift card without problem), the second was not functional because when opening it to recondition it and paste it again glued where the SIM enters and it could not be placed (it returned and it was pumped to card) now to occupy that balance I acquired it and it works well, the battery is fine, I arrive in time but, it has enough details, the flash led is broken, has a hit in a corner and presents multiple scratches, unlike other reconditioned items this is the worst in aesthetics but at least I arrive and if it works, I decided to no longer claim because it was a gift and with the cover it is not noticed and at the end what it needed were the functions."
"The cell phone arrived in good condition, has several very light screen markings, the battery at 85%, the charger is generic but works perfect all the equipment."
"All very well the product and the price charm us"
"The phone impeccable, as new, so far excellent, I have with him a month."
"It's all right, bring two little scratches, but it's all good."
"I bought it in May, today in November I skipped notification that my battery needs maintenance. It arrived with 90% and now has 75%. If I noticed it took longer to charge but I thought it was my charger. Save a thousand more pesos and buy a new one with guarantee! the change of battery comes almost double"
"Everything is perfect, only the speaker doesn't work, I get a bad experience about that type of purchase, probably won't repeat it :( Trust too much on Amazon :("
"The battery condition was lower than I expected. It reached me at 83%"
"came in good condition and even came with a mica. the only flaw I have noticed you after a week almost two of use is that I feel the microphone is very “sensitive” the audios or calls I get to make, it seems that I am speaking very loudly or at a moderate tone when I am even whispering. out of that, all very well"
"The equipment was received very well packaged and protected, it is practically new only minimal details in the frame of the cameras, (see photo attached). I will update them in terms of functionality a few more weeks, as I barely received it yesterday and today activated it."
"All very well with the product, my only complaint is with the shipment they promised me a date and I arrived three days later, but everything else to 100"
"I've been doing a little bit more of the month with the iPhone and my opinion after is the use is that it arrived in good condition, aesthetically 9.5, it has some light scratches on the screen and on the back of the cover, but still it's nothing serious or that it's noticed too much. In matter of the battery came with 91% condition so it's not bad, in the time I've been with the whole it has worked and I haven't had any problem , Face ID, calls and messages, cameras, battery, it doesn't have generic screen so check, GPS, BT , all right, all I would comment is that it's NOT TOTALLY DISLOQUEED FROM COMPANY as it says, I used my phone company Bait and when I inserted the SIM didn't read it, until I tried Telcel and Movistar worked, I had to change company to make use of the Cellular that for me it wasn't a big problem, but it says why at least the time I was not for any company."
"If it wasn't for the battery that comes to 80%, it would be perfect."
"The phone arrived without any scratch on the screen or on the rear glass, came with 95% battery. The only thing we didn't like was that the cables and adapter are generic, they are not original."
"Battery at 85%, so far has not presented any faults and works at 100, only the camera does not have such a good definition but that I think is the model itself."
"The product has scratches on the screen that are seen 3 arms away (not 1 as described), the cleaning in the horn to listen, it seems that it is dirty and I have had some problems with the WiFi of the equipment (suddenly it loses the signal and no longer connects). On the back it is impeccable, as in the contours. The capacity of the battery, is at 84% (already low and soon it will require the change). The charger and the generic cable, work well. I will continue to test the theme of WiFi and if it fails, I will have to return it."
"RECOGNIZING BUYSPRY as it answered me super fast my doubts before buying, the equipment as it describes it. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUYSPRY!!! Soon I will buy you other iPhone"
"I already have a couple of months with the phone and it’s literally 100. It came with 100% battery life, packed as if it were new and with generic charger (the latter was broken down to the month which is understandable). Aesthetically it’s 9.8/10 for a small detail in the corner that is honestly imperceptible. If you’re still undecided if you buy a reconditioning, this is the comment you expected."
"It is delivered with what the description says, however it has more aesthetic details than is mentioned in the publication. It is fully functional."
"The good: arrived in less than 24 hours. The excellent: the overall physical state of the equipment, looks new. The Not So Good (bad): Battery health at 85% and charger and cable of dubious quality, I doubt they are MFI."
"I get there fast, with a hit on the top, until now it hasn't failed."
"The team arrived at me in time and manner as corresponding. The detail is that I got with failure in the battery. I hope the supplier will give me the guarantee of the equipment"
"For in the camera appear some Manchitas and fails to connect to the network after being several hours in the wifi of the others Everything very well"
"The price seems good, but it is not, you can find phones in better condition in sales groups, mix up or on facebook, the cost is high, they have little warranty time, in my case the screen came very scratched, some very deep. The battery comes very well, with 93% maximum capacity. It is not at all bad, it is lucky as the teams leave from Amazon wineries (ask) may touch you a great one or not, I don't think it is worth the risk."
"I got the iphone 11 out of 64 gb only that the earphone and a horn were damaged. I had to apply for return. Otherwise, it worked Perfect."
"At first I had many doubts about buying this phone or not. I saw some bad reviews towards this one and they put me in doubt. However, I bought it and the next day they had already delivered it to me. Among the first thing I wanted to see was the battery since many mentioned that it came from 80 to 90 of capacity and the phone that came to me brings it 100%. As for the aesthetics I give it a 8/10, since it has some details in the top and bottom but nothing that bothers me (at least to me) and in the back you see just a few scratches, nothing to worry about. I am satisfied with the purchase. I will be testing it for several months and if I detected something rare I will publish it. Pd. The face ID pulls well, the same camera and in the few hours that I am in use has not been stuck to me. Update: I have two weeks of use and the phone has behaved to perfection. The battery lasts a day and a half with moderate use (only I use social networks and occasionally when I see some video). Also as to the charge I think it is fine. I put it when it is between 15% and 20% and normally I will not follow in a very much and I will."
"The phone arrived well taken care, unlocked, the battery 86% 128gb, face id, cameras, without scratches, almost new. I had to return it because the majority of screens of iPhones 11 come out defective, have that yellowish color that does not remove the true tone or the night shift, not even changing the shade of colors, I am not the only one I see that happens also with the newest, iPhone 12 pro, max and mini also, being totally new!. I research and are many users who detect this problem and return them to the Apple itself, in short they have diminished their quality control the iPhones, being still new, their screens come out defective, not all some screens if they come out with real colors, I have another iPhone that I have older and looks much better their screen than the 11 being original, check reviews and videos and there are many tests that this screen defect is of manufacture, even the screens of the iPhones 7,6,5 look better. There are X and XS that have compared real screens than the most new ones but it is practical iPad and in you see good luck."
"The article had good aesthetics, but when trying to update it we had problems, we could not activate facetime or imessage, but the main problem is that the battery came deteriorated since its condition was 75% so the same equipment marked that it was damaged, for this reason I decided to return the product"
"Estetically this beautiful came with 81% stack but oh surprise when calling you don't listen :( and when playing music it sounds horrible like the horns were thundered"
"The screen has small stem the stack has 86% The call horn is heard very well The speaker if you raise it a lot like it wants to distort but I don't know distort, whatever the guarantee is, it hurts a gift and it charms it"
"The phone came in a state 9/10 with battery to 82%, excellent buy, until now very good buy, we will see in time update them."
"If I like, phone quality fair price"
"I decided to return it and order a new one, came very scratched the screen, apparently it is lucky that you touch one in good condition."
"The team came to me quickly and in a very well-kept appearance, zero scratches. The capacity of the stack if I arrive less than 85% but all right."
"The phone came in with bluetooth problem (it doesn't connect), I wanted to return it but I couldn't because I didn't bill it (I ALWAYS FACTUREN), the screen was damaged, the camera followed (I never dropped it) A shame that they sell that kind of quality"
"It's no use, face id. You should mention it."
"I liked the equipment, it is in very good condition only has a very slight hit on a corner and is somewhat scratched the screen but passes unnoticed. I put a 4 because it reached me with 87% condition on battery which I would have liked to be better worse equal is an acceptable performance. If I recommend the purchase"
"Aesthetic 10/10, battery had 86% (it is within the acceptable) I have a week with it and without problems, I recommend it (it comes with Mica on the screen)"
"Everything was fine but I had a big, deep rayon on the screen that didn't come in the description."
"Just what I expected, aesthetically the rating is 9 as it brought a slight dent in the charger jack and light scratches on the back of the glass, out of it excellent. Now with the theme of battery life, the minimum that Amazon assures for its products is 80%, in my case I arrive with 81% so it enters that range, I would prefer longer battery life and is the reason why I put 4 stars. It is my first purchase of renewed equipment and if I remember it, moreover, if it is not what you expected you can return the team."
"I've been using it for almost a month and so far it works perfectly!"
"Aesthetically very well, but when you take a photo and use it in zoom, a black stain appears on the screen and photos."
"I like quality price"
"The phone when I received it was the emotion of my life, aesthetic was almost 100 (small blows from above) but as soon as I started to use it came disappointment, I did restore all my information and I passed it from my other iPhone to this one and the phone started to warm horrible and as I continued to use the phone it kept heating up, I put it to charge and it took 3 hours when my other cell was charging in total in 1 being dead, and when I started to use it under super fast the pile and likewise if I used it continuously it would warm up :( I was afraid to buy reconditioned by topics like this, I thought it would be the exception but I see that I am not :c very disappointed, I will try to use it one week but if it continues like this I will change it because it is a phone that I will not be able to use in the day"
"The team arrived with a battery capacity of 99% which I was quite surprised, but it came very grated from the screen (this does not affect the operation) but I think that if you have to consider it when making the purchase, otherwise it had no details and so far it is working very well, the purple color is beautiful and even though it is grated I am very happy with my purchase, if I recommend it."
"You can't demand much for the price, but at least I don't get it with flaws or so much aesthetic damage."
"It arrived in very good condition, without scratches or anything, that if the charger is not original one must be bought. It brought 85% battery"
"I arrived in very good condition and fast, I have been with him for a month and no faults"
"I received the product in excellent condition, in a generic box. Everything works perfectly. It has a small scrape in the housing, but it is almost imperceptible. Battery life is at 85%."
"It's a shame they sell a product with 79% battery level."
"I like that it never fails, everything works very well"
"If you're going to buy a refurbished product don't expect a perfect equipment. The seller offers a semi-new product. I loved my purchase, it's really what I expected, good value for money."
"Hello!! There was no key for the SIM. The screen comes scratched but everything else seems to work well."
"The truth I am very satisfied aesthetic 9.9 just a few microscopic scrapes around the lens of a literal camera neither can be noticed nor affected in anything the battery reached 92% I have been 1 month with the equipment and I feel satisfied with the purchase. Recommended. Obviously the charger and accessories are generic but it is worth investing separately to an original charger to not damage the equipment"
"I bought it in the hot comes out so it came out very cheap, but it came in with 88% stack that quickly low to 87 since it was lower than above, I would have liked to have the luck of one of +95 stack"
"I've come very well, it looks new and everything works at 100."
"Practically new, without any scratch, came to me with 100% battery, cheer up!!"
"It arrived in perfect condition, good aesthetics, 15 days of use everything excellent"
"It all came in good shape and it works perfect."
"It arrived in a generic box, but well protected. Checking it thoroughly has no detail, it looks like new. The only thing, it came to me with 83% battery life, but it works excellent; there are times that I disconnect it in the early morning, I use it since morning and when I return home in the evening, it still has 60%, also depends on its use, since watching multimedia content lasts about 12 hours It was purchased at Westend Enterprises Inc. the service was excellent, they solved all my doubts and even billed it!"
"I arrive without any aesthetic detail, battery at 80%, one of the two speakers is not heard but the audio is excellent"
"Just the detail on the screen, it has a mark on the glass, ok operation"
"The team arrived in time, it came with its generic charger as it indicates, at first glance it looks like new, it has no blows on the edges or anything, light scratch on the screen but only if you pay a lot of attention, the battery is at 84%, the camera well and the horn also, for the moment everything seems good, considerable price and at least super well, the team I like very much and I do not hesitate to continue putting it to the test. If I recommend it."
"Good team is my first iPhone I arrived in very good condition I have been using it 2 months without any problem The pile I got with 88 I have no problem I late all day full"
"The team is at 90% physically but what I do not like is that the battery came to 75% very degraded, the earpiece to listen is heard low, the others it looks good, hopefully not present any fault later. greetings."
"I got very fast the battery reached 85% also grated lego from the back but it is not visible to the naked eye as they left it indicated and came with some marks on the sides but for its price is fine"
"It works very well I already have a time with it and without any problem"
"Biene very good packaged obviously does not include original accessories all generic and as far as aesthetics of the device only arrive with some damage to the part of the camera are slight but if they are noticeable"
"The product came to me well and in perfect condition, the stack is at 80% of its useful life, I have been almost half a year and I have not had problems, nor stack, nor with iOS updates."
"The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, looks new, I got 85% battery, all good so far"
"Good experience in general. It arrived earlier than estimated and the phone looks very good, with scratches almost imperceptible but with very good functioning. That yes, charger and generic box and battery at 86% performance, as indicated in the description. However it is an excellent option to enjoy an iPhone at a much lower price, contributing to decrease the technological waste by giving these products a second chance."
"It came impeccable, without a scratch and everything perfect, the detail is that when I entered configuration I came up with a non-original screen warning, which means that they changed it, for now it works as if it were original, the other aspect with which I did not feel completely happy was that the battery came to 82%, it is within what was agreed yet other users reached 90-100. This review is with two weeks of use."
"I already tried it and apparently everything is in operation, only with the detail that reached 85% of battery capacity, but ps occupied a phone."
"I arrive in perfect condition, aesthetic of 10 only with a small rayon in a corner which I noticed days later, the condition of battery is at 88%, very satisfied"
"I had my doubts when buying a ""reconditioned"" device for some comments, but in this case the cell phone came to me in excellent condition. If you have small details like that the battery is at 99% and in my case I had some very small lines in the glass that you barely see (that with a cover those mothers do not see). But in everything else the device feels like new and the price I am completely satisfied."
"I'VE GOT EVERYTHING WELL EXCEPT OF THE PANT, HE SEES VERY RAYED, AND HE'S GOT A MICE PUT TO TAKE SO MUCH RAYON ALL THE OTHERS WELL."
"Hello, the cell phone came with aesthetics of 10, but, the speakers were heard as blown apart that it came with performance of 73% because the specifications said that they came above 80%."
"The Serbian is excellent."
"Although it is in very good condition, the supplier did not corroborate that the cell phone operation was in perfect condition. The volume of the headset is very low (I think this was a manufacturing defect in the first iPhone 11). But it should have been mentioned in the sales announcement. Otherwise the Product is well and the delivery was fast and safe. Faced with my complaint the seller agreed to return it product but I decided to stay with the Cellular despite this defect."
"The iPhone came in very good condition, with the accessories mentioned but expected a better state of the battery (it came with 80%) came without scratches and well wrapped :)"
"I get extremely scratched from the screen, even it would seem a little cramped"
"Good iPhone, I arrived in my case a few days ahead of schedule, the equipment comes with battery to 84%, a small rayon on the bezel and some deep scratches on the screen (disguise with the mica), that's what I found not so good, in the good things, wow, it's an iPhone, everything else extremely functional and normal without any problem, if I recommend to buy for the price at which I got it, I suggest to stay pending with the price variations and look for the lowest, would give an 8.5 to the transaction in general"
"It came to me with 80% battery; the aesthetic is very good although it has details. It is well phone for the price paid"
"The battery life was very low."
"I didn't like it coming with 84% battery."
"The product is good, despite the reviews if you receive a phone with up to 95% battery. However the phone was damaged in the process, so you have to be on the slope of the state."
"I liked the product, because I renewed my iphone."
"I like and fulfill, I won't return it Good product"
"Being a refurbished phone arrived in very good condition, battery with more than 90%, charger and generic cable. You can only see a small hit on one of the edges, if you see it carefully. In general it is in perfect condition."
"the condition of the battery is at 76% however aesthetically it is in good condition as well as it is working correctly"
"Very low battery condition percentage"
"As new I recommend it 100%"
"Good product. Aesthetic 9/10, arrived with 2 scratches on the side, but the rest of the equipment is impeccable. Battery condition 87%. Everything works fine. Yes I would buy it again. I suggest that they buy products from the United States, give them better care than in Mexico. Better even if they can/have to look for “Premium Conditioned”, it comes out more expensive but it is practically a new phone."
"I arrived in a very good condition and with battery at 85%"
"The iPhone did not have a single scratch on the back or front, it came with a percentage of 83% in battery, it only had a small visible detail around the charger input but nothing of importance, what I realized days later was that one of its speakers did not work, but still has excellent volume and audio quality"
"Everything corresponds to the description"
"It works well with 86 drums but if I came with some scratches both on the screen and in the back, it came intact from the corners and the horns are heard well the scratches are dissimulated with real crystal micas with mica they do not notice anything when his mobile Rea conditioned come with micas remove them to verify that it is in good condition since they really do not notice anything with them"
"The speakers didn't listen well, they listened awfully, and the battery came to me with 84% (something good)"
"The phone reached me without any scratches on the screen or on the back, battery life at 89%. So far it has not presented faults"
"Cell came super well with the stack at over 90% I've been with it and it's still super good, highly recommended seller"
"I've been with him for a month and he hasn't let me down."
"The product itself looks very little used, it came to me with 99% of the battery status, the 256gb that I asked for, so far it has worked normally, the only detail that I noticed was that when I saw another iPhone 11 of a friend (which was acquired new), I felt it with more quality on the screen, very probably the one that I was given had a generic screen, it does not look bad, but I have to admit that the feeling of the screen quality of the other iPhone pleased me much more..."
"The display I was coming with was very generic, terrible quality, from there on out the cell phone has no fault."
"Price is good according to equipment"
"Not because it's not what they're offering."
"It is not recommended if you are looking for a phone in good condition although if it is to replace one already used this well, it arrived fast but does not work the charger and apparently had a lock that did not allow to download applications"
"I had my doubts about buying a refurbished product, but take the risk and be quite satisfied! I got with the stack at 95% and no scratches on the screen. If I had some small scrapes at the bottom where it was loaded but they did not look at the naked eye. The charger has the Certificate and works quite well, although I chose to buy its original charger. In conclusion, I recommend them quite for the price you pay, and with Amazon you have the warranty of 90 days before any failure or not being satisfied! I have been using it approximately and until now all right, I would return to buy it without problems or at least take into account this option when I want to change my cell phone! It is worth cheering for the warranty they give,"
"The impeccable phone as well described, generic but new accessories and work well."
"Buy this equipment for the second time and came with less than 80% load. The store was Telmov. I am already in the process of returning"
"Good device the only detail is a small rayon on the screen but with the mica it is not even noticed, the battery was at 81% health and in less than a week low to 80% of there outside the device works correctly, I hope the battery will stay at that percentage of life for a good while in case of some detail I will update my review."
"I liked the excellent condition he was in, the percentage of batteries and the well-protected package."
"The battery capacity is 100% and everything works perfectly"
"The only bad thing is that it has a malfunction at the top of the screen and does not let use that part of the screen. From there on out I really like the color, the camera, the size and it is very functional."
"It only has a few scratches something considerable the screen but nothing that affects the operation, from there everything works to 100 I recommend it very much"
"Aesthetically it has its obvious details not new but here the moment works well I hope it lasts a long time like this"
"It arrived with the screen very scratched and battery to 81% I do not know how having a supposed quality control Amazon allow this"
"It came with an 85% battery life, excellent in aesthetics, as new only a couple of scratches in the part where the cable is connected but screen and everything else perfect, comes with generic complete charger but of good quality, arrived in time and form."
"All perfect, I've been with him for a month and no failure, literal as new. I'll update the post if it starts to fail later, because I saw some reviews that said it started to fail them in 4 months, to see what happens."
"I just acquired this equipment because I already needed to change my cell after 6 years. The battery as such mentioned is more than 80% the back came with some taps and scratches probably was used for a while without protection and was hit between keys or coins.In the end it works well and I hope I will last another couple of years, in case some other detail comes out I will update this window, I consider that it was a good purchase for the price and capacity of the 128gb memory."
"The truth very well equipment and in very good condition only that it has generic charger and cable otherwise everything well"
"Very good product, the stack at 80%, aesthetic 90% is what the description says and it is fulfilled, very happy with the purchase, I doubted very much but when everything came change the truth better than I expected I would buy again equipment of this type."
"It arrived in excellent condition and with a 100% battery"
"A little more scratched than I expected on the body of the phone, the screen intact. Overall in good condition."
"I arrived in excellent condition, has a slight scratch on the bottom but nothing serious or showy; I have a month with it and everything works very well, the only detail that I got with 80% stack."
"The publication says that the stack brings a minimum of 80% and the one they sent me came with a 75% stack health.It didn't come the SIM tool.The phone works apparently well but doesn't bring band 28 that serves several telephone operators in Mexico, that tells me that this model in the United States because the model in that country doesn't have that band, if you want to use it with some company that uses Altan networks (DIRI, PILLOFON, BAIT, NEWW ETC) is not a good option since it didn't work to connect to that network.I don't know if it works well in Telcel and those most popular companies.It has some aesthetic details that don't cause me any problem."
"I was afraid at first to read various types of comments, the team arrived in a cardboard box with the cell phone and a charger. I got with 89% battery and it works very well, I also arrived already with a glass mica on the screen, and that came already with 1 rayon, but nothing affection to the team.I liked the equipment, what most worried was the battery and I can say that it is in a great state and if it lasts the day without problem, sometimes until more of the day.They can encourage to buy the equipment, in the worst cases only make a return"
"Enchanted with the phone, original battery in excellent condition and at least I did not find any rayon checking it well. To look for something bad would be that the shipment (being national) took a long time even when I have made internationals arriving faster. Likewise the charger does not seem of very good quality. For everything else very good purchase."
"Aesthetically it looks very good, it only has almost imperceptible scratches on the back of the phone. However, the condition of the battery remained at my duty, arrived at 84% and I expected at least 85% or up to 90%."
"I received the phone in excellent condition, without any scraping or carving, except from the screen that had a slight scratches but nothing that affected the operation and even putting the tempered glass on it are covered, had a battery condition of 87% I expected 90% but even to 87% the battery lasts me almost all day with a continuous use.I arrive in generic box of Amazon refurbished and the equal generic charger (that does not use to not damage my equipment) I preferred to buy an original one. In general the conditions of the equipment were excellent:) I have 3 months using it and nothing has failed it."
"I read the experiences and reviews and that stopped me a bit, but I decided to acquire it and the experience was better than I expected, of aesthetics I give it 9.9 out of 10, for a micro dent imperceptible to the touch and the sight, the screen is in perfect condition, as well as the reverse. The battery came to me of 81% which is reasonable and for the price is not at all bad. I would certainly acquire a product again."
"The screen came well grated and the cable very ordinary first day I used it and broke."
"At first I was very scared as I saw many bad reviews but it reached me super well only took 2 days to deliver it and the aesthetic I give 9.6 since there were 3 scratches but no scratches, the only worrying thing is that , the battery appears to me that the piece is unknown but for 1000 more pesos I do not worry since to be a phone of 6,400 in hot comes out for 1000 more pesos I do not worry but the vdd I am very satisfied :))))"
"I lack the tool to eject the , otherwise everything is perfect to see if they can send it to me."
"It was sent super fast, aesthetically as new, even coming with mica on the main screen, the capacity is indicated (256gb) and the battery is 100%"
"I know that being a refurbished product does not guarantee a 100% new product, but I had already purchased one as it came to me perfect, but this time I got a defective product, with several strokes on the carcass and the screen looked up, I had to return it and I got 100% money back"
"I have already bought iPhone several times on Amazon with different sellers and have always come to me in excellent condition, no error or hit. This computer if it came with a small detail in the corner as a small blow but nothing that affects, in fact nor is seen unless they are reviewing very in detail. As for the back and the screen no problems comes as if it were new. The battery if it came a little worn out like 85% but it is still functional."
"It just comes with a warning that the screen isn't original."
"I had my doubts when I bought it, I had never bought a Rea cell phone conditioned and the truth is that I think I'll be getting them like this, I arrive with 90 stacks and in the best conditions, I've already been with him for several months and I haven't had a single problem"
"When the phone received the condition of the battery was 79%. The ring that surrounds the cameras is not the color that corresponds to the model originally and this looks bad from afar (photo attached). It also arrived with dirt in the port of charge, on the speakers and on the microphone."
"The product arrived practically new except for scratches at the back of the device, however, it complies with the requirements for the condition in which it was purchased."
"The product worked very well, the problem is that they send it to you with an integrated mica, in my case within two days it started to stain so I went to replace it and at the time of removing it we realized that it came glued with a gel glue that was completely attached to the screen and it was very difficult to remove causing damage to the screen, I am in process of return"
"I am very satisfied with this purchase! The driving and the function of the phone is perfect for me! Everything came with my expectations.Thank you!"
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, the battery comes to 87% is not father since it does not last long and the charger it brought does not serve . In matter of aesthetics 10 of 10"
"The pile, it doesn't last long."
"Aesthetic came very well 95%, but in the life of the battery I get less than 80% with just 3 weeks of use already has 78% of life, generic regular quality charger is heated a lot, does not include clip for sim card, I am not very sure if I recommend it, contemplates that it will have to change very probably the battery."
"I asked for it in black and it came to me with damaged pixels on the screen and with the screen slightly taken off from a corner, I had to return it again to order one now white and I got excellent as new ! It is the advantage of buying on Amazon!!"
"The team came up with the message that the screen is not original, the problem is that it did not work well, the colors were not correct, the maximum brightness was not so high and the touch did not respond properly, I returned it, now let us see how the return works."

"First time I bought a renovated equipment. I didn’t know what to expect. In Apple it turns out that the RENEWED PREMIUM equipment is better and have a longer warranty than the No Premium. This phone I bought came in a white box with green AMAZON and inside a generic cable and charger. When removing the plastic protection from the phone, my surprise was to find a PRACTICALLY NEW equipment. No punch or brand of other type. The only thing I found (and because I was looking for something) a tiny scratch on the screen next to the frame. Surface strip of about two millimeters... The battery is 91% and when I turned it on immediately the operating system to IOS 16.1.2 TODO, everything works very well. I don’t notice the difference between a new equipment and this one. Definitely, it’s an excellent investment and decision to go for this equipment."
"The equipment is in a condition that almost looks new, only because it has a bit of dirt on the headset but super well cared for"
"excellent product, in excellent condition, as new, highly recommended"

"The team came to me with an aesthetic 10 out of 10 practically as new, in matter of the battery I got 100% using it about 20 days and its operation is the right one, the equipment comes released I am using it in AT&T, the only detail is in the charger that is very generic but functional without any doubt I would buy again"
"The team arrived 10/10 seemed completely new, the month of use stopped getting signal, took it to check and was fractured from the card, charged me 200 dls for welding,"
"I arrived super well. Without any detail, with the battery at 100%; everything amazing, it was very good decision.More than 1 month without problems!Recommended!"
"The media could not be loaded. Very good experience with the purchase came two days earlier than I said, it came with 91% battery (it seems that the equipment never opened) as new practically, if I recommend buying at least my experience was excellent"

"I bought this iPhone with the fear that it would not meet my expectations, fortunately, this iPhone is found ""How new"" I inspected it for a considerable time and has not a single scratch, the battery found 100%"
"It came with less than 90% battery and with the certificate that says that if it does, besides that the horn below came broken and all the buttons and speakers full of earth that means that they don't even clean it, they didn't want to return me even the money of the repair of the horn and the accessories that it brings as the charger are of the lowest possible quality; only the cable is mfi the cube was more chafa than nothing."
"It's all very well."
"the cell phone arrived with a sand stripe on the screen, little perceptible, but to me it is a damage, when I turn it on and choose the language, there it stays and does not advance, terrible experience, now I hope not to give so many turns with my refund since I requested the return"
"It was in a very good condition, the battery was moderate, everything is fine, Face ID, screen and sim. Recommended."
"All good but one of the sound outputs is no longer heard and so I saw the majority touched the condition of the battery greater than 95% and that I buy the version renovated in excellent condition... it is advisable to buy the version in middle and not the excellent because I see no difference ... I can return it until November there I see that such goes x 1 month but for the moment everything well ..."
"Excellent product, it arrived with exactly all its descriptions of sale. Correct investment. Recommended!!!"
"The phone looks great outside, the battery to change, being a mobile preowned you expect the result to be better than just one reconditioning. It is not worth it"

"I thought it was bigger."
"That I arrived on time and very good tel."
"I have the phone already 3 months and so far everything is perfect. I use it in Ecuador and it serves well with my operator. Delivered in generic box, cable and generic cube of good quality. Stetic level 9/10 since the screen if it shows symbols of use and minor scratches.Finally to be a phone of 2020 is quite expensive."

"It's the second phone I buy and it's got several details that seem to be pretty much used."
"I think it's really bad battery, this is a battery state with over two years of one of a cell phone, so pay I think it should be better! I buy a cell phone in excellent condition, not good, for one of good would be good but for excellent, the truth I feel disappointed"
"I didn't expect the battery to be so low as it was premium."
"Not in perfect condition much investment"

"They are not refurbished cell phones, they are used as they said in another comment. I bought mine in “excellent conditions” but it has scratches and blows at several points of the cell phone. The worst thing is that it came dirty in the headset, speakers and with grease stains on the screen. It is q to say that they did not even bother to clean it, that is why it is not refurbished. It is not worth its price. Invest a little more and better buy a new one with battery at 100%. It is what I should have done."
"It has no scratches and works perfectly. I recommend the purchase"
"The screen was mistreated and the battery life is not worth it."
"on the screen indicates that the answer is not organital, the camera terrible, LAUGHTER I live in Guatemala and I find it very expensive to send it back, but it was very bad purchase"

"good product thanks"
"I was like new, I loved it, it works perfectly"

"The phone arrived with very good aesthetics and without scratches and in the requested color. Battery to 90%. It has only been in use for a few days, but there have been no problems. Cable and charger work well, but by quality I guess they won't last long."
"Renovated premium is the option."
"He hesitated to buy it because it was reaccommodated but so far very well. The battery condition came in 80% something that I did not like very much but the same said in the product information."

"In cell I arrived with excellent aesthetics and the battery at 100%, besides that the delivery was on time"
"Fulfill what I need"
"They've got a few little scratches in the back, but everything else is fine."
"The product came in good condition, the battery came a little low with 84% of life, so I put 4 stars"

"I like it, it has 91% battery and is in perfect condition"

"The phone came in new, a little bump but nothing serious"
"I love buying on Amazon if they get to have any problems just ask to get the product back and send it another, the truth is that it is an excellent product and still has AppleCare"
"I saw that many came with scratches on the screen but it was not my case, I only had a few small hits on the corner of the iPhone and on the edge of the camera but they are almost IMPERCEPTIBLE, the battery had 89%, everything totally fine, very happy with my purchase."
"The phone came to me with a 100% battery, obviously they replaced it but on the phone it does not mark any warning that this is chafa, so I guess it must be the original. Analyzing the phone consciously using Utools does not send any warning. 100% satisfied with the purchase"
"I doubt when I bought it for some reviews I read but I was surprised by the aesthetics that I had, everything works at 100, cameras, speakers, touch, everything Perfect, only for the section of the battery that I reached 88% but still very well."
"I bought this iPhone at a very good price, it has a very good aesthetic, only minimal scratches on the screen, same that I noticed once I changed it the mica I brought. It brought a percentage of stack of 91% The charger and cable with which it comes, although they are generic, loads very fast. For the moment it goes great, I hope I survived. It is beautiful!"
"The price seemed great to me. The equipment comes in very good condition, it has only a very small scratch on the screen but almost not noticed, everything else super well. The battery is at 87%. It works perfect. Super recommended these equipment ratio price and state of it."
"The equipment arrived very well and indicates that the battery has a 100% capacity. Delivery time was good and arrived with a pre-installed mica, cable and charger."
"I don't like that the volume is too low even when you are to the speaker you must see the cell stick to the ear to hear it maybe 40% the volume purchased from another device"
"In my case the phone came in generic box and with generic charger (which is already gain because the phone does not bring it from factory).The condition of my battery is excellent (100%).It has a slight scratch on the top but with a cover is capped."
"I arrive in perfect condition despite being Reaccondido, first team that I buy and without problem."
"Excellent product, aesthetic and battery"
"The phone came with 88% battery would have preferred above 90% but it's fine, it only has 2 details of which only 1 is really visible and with a cover you don't see any, it came something dirty but nothing from the other world, with second hand cables but decent quality, The only setback is that I see 2 scratches on the screen, outside of that excellent."
"Until now I have no problem with the product, I feel that it is new and looks promising, until this moment I give 10/10 to the seller and to the publics as it reached me what I expected"
"I grabbed it like 2 thousand pesos less than it regularly costs. It arrived on time, a couple of scrapes that can be covered with a cover without any problem and 100% battery, a cool one. BuySpry excellent seller."
"Very good product, it is the first time I buy a Renew Product and is in impeccable condition"
"Equipment without aesthetic details, only the battery performance is 88%. I would have liked the product review to mention the battery detail."
"It's perfect."
"The battery comes to 96 which for quality price is done very well, and comes with some scratches on the screen but compensates that it brings a mica, everything else works perfect"
"The team arrived in good condition with a couple of hits on the corners and scratches on the edges of the cameras (the cameras are in good condition and without scratches on the crystals). The battery with 87% quality, the screen without scratches and all functions operate normally: Horns, microphone, WiFi, Bluetooth, Face Id, etc."
"Very good physical conditions, without significant damage, very light bolts of use. Excellent operation and battery condition at 90%."
"The aesthetic of 10, brought a tiny scratch almost imperceptible around one of the cameras, the battery with 90%, the charger the truth if it looks quite generic and in the same way comes to you in a generic box, I had to return it because the battery was very heated when using certain apps like seeing the stories of IG or charging it (I loaded it with an original fast charge), also the horn was misheard, as if it was “revented” or changed it and it was not the original one, I have another iPhone 12 at home and it does not happen that, so I decided to return it. The advantage of buying reneweds in Amazon is that you have 1 month to prove them and if you are not pleased to return them, but eye, the policies say that in teams Apple the return can take up to 1 month, more than it takes the bank to put the money in your account because they have to review them very well. Take this into account if you are uncertain between a reconditioner or a new one. It is the first time I buy a reconditioned and my experience was not of the good equipment and finally it is a matter of luck."
"The cell phone works well, with a generic charger and running smoothly. I only had two scratches in the corner frame and would hit 88%, but the truth by price I can’t complain."
"I was very surprised that the battery will arrive at 99%, the phone does not present many physical details practically a 9 out of 10, in how much to its operation is very good I have been with him for a week and I have not had any problem, I will update later for more details..."
"All for description Battery (87%) Estetica (9/10) Cameras, Bluetooth, Wifi, Red (10/10)"
"Not at 100 aesthetic details but price goes by"
"Excellent conditions, I arrive with 100% of the battery. My best purchase"
"It's a good team in my experience. It's the first time I've bought something reconditioned and so far I haven't had any flaws. I hope I'm still the same."
"The only thing I didn't like and that's with amazon that indexes 90-day warranty of renewed product and a month no longer gives you the option to return it"
"Honestly I returned it, because the aesthetic details were visible, they had strong use blows were two, but if they were too worrying because I thought life would have given him then? Everything was original and everything else was fine for the price, otherwise you care about those things I recommend the product."
"I bought an “acceptable” state iphone, but in very good physical condition (the purchase was with clevercel). Battery with 87% of life, no modified piece, only a few scrapes in the corners (hidden with a cover), and the best 2k less than those that say “excellent state”. I do recommend clevercel."
"I arrive in very good condition, it has a few small almost invisible details. The battery with 94% condition. I am happy for now and I find it a very good option to help the planet and not buy completely new products!! I will use it for a few more days to see how it works but so far I am delighted!"
"I got it at a promotional cost of $13,100 MXN. For that price it is a very good computer that does not ask anything from model 13 and even 14, as the only differences are in the chip, the video and a couple more things like the 6 months of Apple Music. Saving between $5,000 and $8,000 for having almost the same is a big advantage, with that easy you buy Airpods Pro. Outside of that, the quality (in my case) was very high, as the team arrived in excellent condition (as new, without scratches, only with charger and cable) and so far fully functional. I would recommend buying a USB-C cable from Lightning apart to take advantage of the fast charge and a good cover for it to look."
"I don't know if it was lucky, but it turned out good despite being reconditioned."
"I have a month with the cell phone, so far it has worked very well, I get well careful with some small scratches that are not noticed, the pile is 89%, they have delivered it with charger, cable, I am very satisfied with the purchase"
"I did a pre-purchase study so the iPhone arrived as all the Reneweds were supposed to arrive, the box in perfect condition and with what was promised. The phone SI has signs so I will give you in aesthetics a 9/10 has 3 ""stitches"" on the frames and a very small scratch on the edge of the camera. The screen has very few scratches, nothing to prevent the use of the screen as well as that the protector makes it look impolute. The battery arrived at 90% and the included charger is functional to no more power, I even wanted to do the first load with a fast Samsung charger and not quizo, solution: use the included generic. The software is fine, the compatibility with the phone (Telcel) to the first, 4G and 5G functional, and all functional connections. In a few words I did a general test that took a day and a half and nothing fault. The battery has no problems, the screen does not work perfectly. I think opening the mind to think that it is a semi-new mobile you realize that it is an excellent purchase and that you saved a very good money."
"It doesn't come with a charger."
"It is very good offer and the phone is perfect has a very small details but nothing important or that affects, if I recommend it for the price that is much better than a new one"
"It exceeded all my expectations, I was very satisfied with my purchase. It came the next day. The iPhone came well packed, with mica on the screen and charger. Only with a few small details on the camera that really do not notice anything. Battery capacity of 93%"
"I have previously purchased electronic equipment ""refurbished"", ""open-box"", and an Iphone X ""re-accomanded"" 3 years ago that has finally failed and I wanted to replace it with model 12, because for me they represent a great return of value for my money; however I think that they are maliciously perverting the use of the word because the unit I received is simply and plainly used. In the included image you appreciate the damage that the carcass presents, which would be the first thing I hope it will be re-conditioned, but still, when I turn on the computer the system indicates that the battery life is 86%, same that it must be ""re-conditioned""; then I do not understand what they say they guarantee in the re-conditioning, they should simply say unit with two years of use and ready, if anyone buys it knows what to expect. The stars awarded are for the fast attention to shipping, although I can suppose the urgency to get rid of dead inventory. In apple the completely new is only four thousand pesos more, which is what I will do this time: go to the safe with the new one."
"I really liked the iphone 12 I bought as it had 92% battery and a 9.8 aesthetic, I recommend the BuySpry seller."
"Although it is true that it has good aesthetics within what fits (because both the loudspeaker above and the microphone and speaker are dirty), it reached me with 88% the life of the battery , behaves well, but with other suppliers it is rare to arrive below 90%, from there on out everything excellent."
"With the device all right so far, only that the cable to charge was bad... I should have been usb a lighting and came to me with a usb a usb type ""c""."
"The description of the product was of excellent condition, damages not visible to more than 30 cm and apart, a team supposedly ""renewed"". It came totally beaten, the screen scratched and even raised, as it took off and wanted to ""deceive me"" putting a mica. Terrible experience, it is not worth at all, you are buying a product worse than used, because my current cell phone is 5 years old with me and does not have the amount of blows that it is supposedly renewed. I had already bought by amazon renewed and it was impeccable, but this time super bad experience"
"In general, the equipment is in very good condition.The condition of the battery is 100%, aesthetically it has no detail either on the back or on the sides and everything works perfectly.The only thing that is not in such good condition is the screen, which has some visible scratches and that are deeper than I expected according to the description of the product, but because the rest is in perfect condition it does not bother me.As for the accessories, they are not original; the cable seems good to me but the charger if it seems of poor quality so I did not use it.In addition, the equipment came with a tempered glass installed, which is appreciated.Definitely it seems a very good purchase, with the only detail that the condition of the screen was worse than expected."
"I was a little nervous to know how I was going to arrive but to my surprise everything came in order, and with battery condition 100%, I have not failed at anything the iPhone, I highly recommend it"
"It arrived soon, it reached me with the stack to 100 works well, only it arrived with some scratches on the screen which do not affect its functioning and are only noticed with the screen off"
"Equipment in very good condition"
"Highly recommended, I understood the renewed Amazon United States and was an excellent purchase, this totally new."
"The state was almost perfect, a small hit on a corner and a minor rayon, branded battery condition at 100%, the system does not mark battery replacement and marks just 12 months of use, the problem is that the battery although it lasts, does not reach the level of a battery to 98% of one use with which I could compare, so it made me suspect that the software was altered.Almost everything works well but some apps are locked or as in the case of Tik Tok, it gets stuck a song from the previous video.I returned it because I did not trust those software random failures.In my case it was the premium version ,Sold and sent by Amazon USA"
"I bought the article but it came blocked by operator :(. I returned the phone and bought it again thinking that it was only bad luck the first time, the second time everything excellent, the iphone is in very good condition and now if it is unlocked."
"The phone is sent in perfect condition, working everything, however my team arrived with a deep rayon on the screen (it is understood because the computer is not new)"
"To be a remanufactured equipment, it is in good condition.The screen, without scratches and the operation of hardware and software is fine.Just a few minimal details of aesthetics at the bottom.It arrived well packed.The only problem is that I need invoice and to date the seller has not sent it after several requests."
"Honestly if I have bought enough refurbished products and the great majority have come out very good, but this one took the crown. The iphone came to me with 98% battery, tempered glass mica and Apple Care with validity of 7 months on the day of purchase. I don’t know if all come in those conditions but at least mine if I brought it. Best of all, by buying it in the days of prime day, it cost me 40% less of its original price!"
"Excellent as new and even with mica"
"In the announcement he mentioned that there were two options: good and excellent. Select “excellent”, but the team came with scratches"
"The product arrived on time and great aesthetics, just a small detail in the aluminum part of the size of the tip of a needle. From there on out as new the stack at 100% no rayon visible on the screen. It comes with very good quality protector I made the mistake of putting one and the quality of the touch under very much so I realized that I had double mica end up removing the other one. Work of the exceptional cameras it should be emphasized that I had the S20FE only strange little the 3x Zoom but it is really used few times. I am very happy with this purchase."
"Battery life at 99%, aesthetic of 9.5/10, excellent value for money. It does not come with the original charger or cube, but it is generic and functional. I would buy it again completely."
"The team came to me with 100% battery condition and I thought they had changed it but when reviewing the serial it is the same factory, only a few scratches on the screen and the back cover that at first sight do not see you have to see it against light, from there on out the equipment looks new and I am very satisfied with the purchase."
"The media could not be loaded. It arrived with 90 percent battery, arrived without any scratch, in fact it looks like a team totally out of store, even came with a Mica included and the generic charger is fast charge, I recommend it very much, I go for a month with it and everything is perfect"
"It came with 90 percent battery, arrived without any scratches, in fact it looks like a team totally out of store, even came with a Mica included and the generic charger is fast charge, I recommend it very much, I am going for a month with it and everything is perfect"
"The team arrived with very few imperfections, some of them on the banks and edges of the camera, what if I didn't like it at all was that even with the ""cleaning"" of experts Amazon could erase the marks of use of the former owner's cover. 87% battery blows and scratches, acceptable since we talked about a used equipment, that if the screen impeccable no damage. only that that it has marks of use of the somewhat loose cleaning cover by parts of the workers.. for a saving of 4500 pesos. well, there are still places like mobilex and smart depot that you find it cheaper."
"Very good cell phone, I recommend"
"The product tells me that the screen is not original and that it was replaced by a screen that gives no guarantee that the cell phone works properly."
"The phone came to me in 1 day, I got with the generic box just like the charger, the device physically has only 2 strokes one on the bottom and one near the camera, but it doesn't affect anything to the camera just a little scratch on the edge that covers the camera, physically it's a 9.5 functionally pulls well the life of the battery is 87% there are people who touch them luck and comes out above 90 but well let's hope it doesn't affect its functionality"
"The product arrived in excellent condition, 0 scratches, 100% battery life and even had a screen protector already installed, it was perfect. The only detail, comes with a very short cable and a power adapter of few watts, it is necessary to buy the accessories if you want to get a better experience but compared to a new and sealed one that also does not come the charger if it is a good saving, I recommend it if you seek not to invest so much in a phone of this range."
"It is the second iPhone 12 that I buy and the first came to me with 89% battery and in aesthetics a 9 and the latter I arrived with 100% battery and aesthetic 10 could practically say that it was new."
"I arrive with 90% battery life, it has some scratches and aesthetic details but they are not perceived by the naked eye and do not affect performance. It comes perfectly clean and with a mica of tempered glass."
"He runs out of the super fast stack Sometimes he stuck the screen at the beginning The audio sounds horrible if I want to put on speaker or music But the physical aesthetic super gives the catazo"
"Product is not reconstructed as echo design is used charger are not original box not only came the Amazon box came only the phone, check the pile only brought 80% nothing to do with the photos I published brought scratches on the bottom and the display is not smelled as I bought it because it was rebuilt Not used, a little desitado"
"I was encouraged to buy it because I needed to change my previous phone. Reading the comments was that I was convinced, seeing almost as new, slight details of the part of the camera that was dispainted but it is less than 1mm, are only two dots. So in two other areas that being honest just and noticed, with cover you won’t even know that it’s not new. Everything works perfect, 91% battery, very satisfied with the purchase. It comes in a geneticist box with cable “made for iPhone” and a generic cube, besides covered in a movie to avoid scratches on the phone, I don’t regret until now."
"Considering that it is a USADO computer, it is very well battery to 90. Speaking of iPhone 12 network has one side without metal but it is normal for editing"
"It cost me very cheap for the conditions in which it came, practically as new and with 100% battery condition. Everything works excellent, it was a great purchase"

"Well I had bad luck, aesthetic 8/10 comes with several scratches and the battery is 88, I'll return it"
"From the best purchase, I had the opportunity to buy it when I was still more BARATO and I do not regret it, the equipment arrived intact, new totally, without any scratch, until the battery 100% could not believe it, I recommend the equipment and the seller.

"I was nervous because in the reconditioned cell phone purchases you can get everything and there were no reviews of Mexico, but my cell phone arrived intact!!! As new!! I am really happy with my new cell phone, it is beautiful and has everything I expected"
"Maybe I had bad luck, the cell phone came and worked well, but then at hours of heat, and the screen didn't respond at all well, then after three days, I stopped working the screen, luckily I could return it."
"I arrived in time, I got a few scratches but very superficial, of battery I reached 89% with mica, for the price was an excellent purchase, the only but that I would put it is that it comes with generic charger and cable, but from there everything is perfect"

Then the seller puts you a mica of protection to simulate that the phone is in good condition! A real trick! I can't believe Amazon lends itself to this type of scam! This phone doesn't worth that $500 that I was charged!!!!!Wish and Amazon put these fraudulent sellers in place!"

Casually only one month after the warranty period. 16,000 pesos to the trash, the seller simply stopped responding and wash his hands with his 90 day warranty.

"Hello good night I would like to talk to someone who takes care of the quality of the iPhone is that it is grated and I expected it to be in better condition I expect your answer thank you"
"Striped screen, scratched lenses and sell it as ""renewed"" when it is clearly a product that has already been used and altered. 30 minutes were enough to realize that it was not worth it, on top they put a glass mica to ""hide"" the scratches and pretend that they are in mica when not, they are on the cell phone."

Its condition was good, however it could never be configured, it couldn't be updated and it didn't let me transfer the data, which made me think if it was STOPPED. I had already purchased a renewed iPhone 8 and had no problem, but this was a total disappointment.I returned the phone and to avoid problems better I won't buy it again."
"The cell phone came in aesthetically well, but it restarts for no reason at all and it seems just as they return it they put it on sale without really rebuffing it"

"Please I demand an explanation. The phone came with the power button completely glued or when making calls it was heard very low (I did everything I found in forums and specialized sites to try to raise the volume of my speaker and nothing). Finally I took it to an Apple store and they tell me that by being ""reconditioned"" apparently when they installed the screen it was stuck in the ignition button and on the speaker's grid to listen. The arrangement is worth more than the phone. PLEASE I EXIGN AN EXPLANATION BECAUSE I SELL A TELEPHONE AS IT IS A RIGHT STAFF!. I am attentive"

"Cons: The iPhone came with generic box and generic accessories (which is described in the publication).A battery with life of 81% (as described in the publication, but the battery if it feels old) Details of use on the sides, is iPhone is worn out and even disentangled in some areas especially of the buttons per use; I did not expect an impeccable design but in the lens of the camera it is appreciated as if it had fallen and the part of the paint is already mistreated and with slicing of the blow (on the edge of the lens).The worst thing: When placing my SIM did not grab the network either of AT&T or Telcel , it always stayed in ""net not available"" for this reason was why I chose to return it. Besides at the time of inserting my SIM in the details section, it did not show my phone number but another completely different, which made me think that this provider either used a digital SIM (eSIM) or still anchored to that number, this was another flag net to return it. In the box comes a perfect note of steps to return it, delete configurations and your product to me to think that this provider has many details of it is very impet."
"In aesthetics it is impeccable, they do not have a scratch on the frame and the screen in general is fine. On battery I arrive with 81% but still endures the battery all day. It came included a glass mica already installed"

"I was so excited to receive the iPhone and when I opened it the truth disappointed me a little why it did not come in its original box was only white and for the amount paid one waits for it to come with all the accessories, they also sent a charger that is point in his favor! The cell phone came without scratches the screen very well I charmed, the bad in the part of the cameras came a bit dirty I had as dust cleaned it and remained perfect!. I thought to return it but the truth charm me and the cell works very well. I think buying the line carries its risks that things get bad, maybe it is better to buy in the apple store. I gave it 3 stars because I got a little dirty and without the original box out of that the cell was perfect!. To those who sell the product please clean them before sending them! We pay a lot and hope to receive everything well. Thank you!"

"Life of the bacterium at 100"
"It looks like a new phone and the best thing is that it comes factory free"
"The price is ridiculously expensive for a renewed device, they do not guarantee that the IP68 classification will be present on the device and may no longer be fully waterproof... plus for about 100 dollars or so, you can get Apple’s new iPhone 14 Pro Max directly or a cell phone service store. THEY DO NOT KEEP BUYING FROM THIS/TO BUSER, nor an iPhone 13 Pro Max costs so much!!!"

It should be noted that I bought the cell phone in the condition of excellent re-conditioning. The cell phone did not come with any detail, no scratch. PERFECT ENTER, with 100% battery.

It was certainly an EXCELLENT purchase, recommended the seller at 100% of the moment, any situation later if anything arises I will keep them updated."
"I read good and bad comments, I know that it is always a risk to buy Reconditioned products but I decided to risk it and it was certainly the best, cell this new has limited warranty until August 2023, 100% battery, connects to the network without problems, I have been using it for a week and everything excellent.
