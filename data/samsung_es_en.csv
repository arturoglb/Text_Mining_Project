"Reviews"
"Good product I liked very much"
"Good phone, though it's not version 5g, and the frames are bigger than I expected."
"Excellent terminal, very good ratio, quality price. Recommended"
"My son was very happy. Super recommended"
"I really liked the phone, but I bought it supposedly unlocked for all companies and it wasn't like that, I can't use it with Verizon and sprint and they never said anything about it that was what disappointed me."
"spectacular performance and amazing photos!!"
"Very useful"
"It arrived at the stipulated time, in good condition! It works very well and at good price, excellent"
"Excellent equipment. But the screen is already scratched and the original hearing aids poorly heated only worked a single horn. It is cumbersome the process of claim."
"I have used the phone several months in which I have verified first hand its impeccable performance.. In Ecuador I have no problem with the different telephone operators.."
"Returned the same day as the device arrived with the rear broken"
"I got the phone but I didn't get the headphones or the USB connector and the article description says they're included."
"An easy purchase, lots of power, construction quality and slot to expand memory is a plus that no longer comes. The last great note."
"The equipment comes renovated directly by samsung. It even looks new. With all its plastics and protectors. The processor is snapdragon. This almost at the height of the new ultra s22 and the truth is that it does not ask anything. And you even save almost 8,000 pesos. It works well with the telcel network. I definitely recommend it. It only brings data cable but. I do not recommend buying the ultra fast charger since you wear your battery. The fast charge even notice that it makes it faster than on my S10+."
"He arrived in perfect condition, without any detail"
"The equipment in excellent condition the only detail is that it says it includes auditory and charger and only came the USB out of there in perfect condition everything and is snap Dragon 5g 128 GB 12 ram"
"Q I don't cast out complete only cast the device and the Chablé to load but not the plug where to connect the charger carnation"
"Very satisfied."
"It's very interesting how without realizing the battery is downloaded I spend hours with the cell phone and distract me easily hard up to 5 hours using it reading or watching videos and because almost neither do I charge the cell, I usually wake up at 3 pm and just at 7 pm or 9 pm is that I am reconnecting the cell only because it has a charge of 36% or lower"
"If what you are looking for is a camera is very good! Now if what you are looking for is a phone it is better to buy it in a recognized store, over here it is impossible to find something that works well!"
"I can't get the cell phone charger, who I can talk to."
"Good team has good camera"
"That's the reason for the refund."
"I come from a samsung j7 (2016) and have this cell phone is so beautiful, it's a big change I like so much, I love that it comes unlocked from factory, I am from Honduras I have Red Tigo and it worked 100% since the first time I put the chip on it, I don't touch to go activating the cell phone and spending too much, the facial recognition I haven't tried it, the print reader I feel it costs you always I have to put my finger minimum twice because I don't recognize it, I think it downloads a little fast, it's 100% I get to play a little bit and I already have it in 97 and a game that is not taan difficult (Beach buggy) , sometimes I feel like it gets hot from the top side of the camera because I think it's because I step stuck in the cell all day and the environmental temperature here doesn't help, when I put it to charge fast charge in about 1 hour and 10 or 30 mints., sometimes I love its way of night is very sharp, the front camera I don't leave me very happy if you in good light conditions you will not look the photo, the cellular is rare, the truth, the mobile is, I recommend it's it's it's it's amazing it's it's it's amazing, the picture, the picture, it's it's it."
"New phone, short battery life, directly unplug it from its charge and 98% battery"
"It's nice and if you can activate it in any phone company"
"The only complaint I have so far is that the battery doesn’t last at all. It lasts 6 hours and I’ve always had Samsung and they always last a long time."
"Very good team."
"The only thing I could say against is the battery, you have to know how to administer it in the day to day."
"Easy to touch and durable battery."
"For now I like it, I'm still testing it."
"Being an industry standar, they should indicate beforehand that it does not come with a space to increase memory through SD memory (neither micro, nor mini, nothing). Also you can not connect your headphones on the computer. Its graphic performance is excellent and its processor is very good, but the battery does not last as long as it is promoted. It is important to know that if you are of those who take many photographs, or download your series or music on the phone, you are obliged to buy space in the cloud"
"I arrive on set dates and physically is in perfect condition"
"I sent it for my son to Cuba, and today I was able to send him the charger, with a friend going there."
"I took him to a workshop because he didn't recognize the line and they told me it was a copy, then they put my line somewhere else and it worked, but I'd like to know someone told me it's a copy. I'm left with the doubt that I'll pay for it as an original."
"Very good product."
"The battery, cameras, are great has all the functions of a flagship such as your older siblings the s20, the fluency of the screen to 128 hertz is great, however with the latest update I have noticed some lag at the time of opening the camera application, I hope to improve with future updates, and if or if it is necessary to use tempered glass because with the short time I have been using and emphasizing that I have taken care of it enough, however I already have several scratches and even in the glass of the part of the camera so yes or if tempered glass for screen and camera module!"
"I like it at all, the phone is good, it doesn't get too hot when using, it has Snapdragon processor, the camera is good, the temperature manageable. my device didn't come to me with the fault of the fake touches on the tactile so I appreciate it. They got confused by putting 8 GB of RAM when the coming one is 6 GB RAM"
"The whole beautiful phone I highly recommend"
"I bought 2 phone and the truth works great good hard camera the battery is fast is perfect"
"the cell phone box arrived open, it may have been checked in customs, at least that's what I want to think; all the accessories were there, so far everything goes great with the team. Let's hope that I don't present any problems past the 90 days that gives me Amazon. Rapidly in the shipment, although internally UPS I take a little time to deliver it to me. Thank you"
"If happy with the products chosen and received."
"Take very good pictures"
"Excellent offer and excellent equipment. 100% recommended"
"This very nice cell phone I put 4 stars because in vibrating mode is not very strong"
"Better cell phone!"
"Good cell phone so far. Everything as expected."
"So far I have not had faultst, I just have a month to buy it and I have loved everything .. Only that this version no longer has entry for the headphones or to connect it to the car and listen to music and everything is via Bluetooth"
"This is a very good phone facial recognition is very good as well as the fingerprint reader and the battery lasts me for a day or day imedio depending on my use"
"He won't let me in my samsung account and I can't open apps"
"I was nervous to be the first time I bought a cell in this way. Luckily it went well, I am happy with my cell phone, I have more than a week using it, so far everything excellent."
"The cell phone works great. The only thing that worried me at first was a heat in the battery while I used it the first few days. Everything else is perfect. Intact without scratches. Excellent"
"I was just looking for a good phone and at a reasonable price. So far all right Thank you!"
"Very good experience. The equipment in excellent finishes Very good fluidity and speed in applications, good camera. Too bad the charger is not 25W, but it is not essential."
"the phone is good as normal user the battery lasts me all day"
"Buy the phone and send it to Colombia by the CondorBox locker, everything was excellent, the bands are released and I work with CLARO COLOMBIA."
"It arrived well, within the set time, the box is open, sure is normal that. Procedure....and the product...is according to what you wanted....are recommended...."
"Excellent product, compared to my S8 I feel a great renovation"
"I bought this phone to be able to play Call of Duty Mobile. I was tempted to buy another terminal, designed specifically for that purpose. But in the end I decided for Samsung by its style that it is quite more refined and because, on paper, its features were similar. A good chip and a good screen with high cup of soda. Unfortunately the phone has had some faults. At first it was software. Problems with Google Play, with discord and now with the reading of sim card. I must restart the phone so that the calling, messaging and Internet services work. It’s a shame. Besides the facial recognition and fingerprint reading software on screen is really bad. Finally, the connectivity with accessories from brands other than Samsung is quite bad. I have a Xiaomi wristband and the connection between the phone and the band and unstable. I must be opening the mifit application for you to download information constantly."
"Very good device"
"Exheat quality"
"I do not like that there arrived incomplete Handset + Cling is missing"
"works perfect very good purchase"
"All right."
"Very good phone."
"Excellent product"
"The battery lasts only about 8 hours. I had it only one day, and the next day I sent it back. The problem is that the refund takes up to a month to arrive"
"Problems with the load connector"
"The phone battery quickly wore out even when it wasn't using apps. It was probably defective, but to be a ""new"" phone it's not acceptable."
"It only worked 30 days. Diagnosis Samgsung Authorized Center - Damaged Logic Card. ERROR OF AFRICA. Now I must pay to return it and they can solve a problem that is not mine."
"I get the cell phone, but it takes him to high school and they tell me he's not unscrambled, what can I do????????????? Tell me what he bought?"
"They reduced the price a couple of days later to the purchase I made. I should get a bonus at least."
"One week after using the phone, the battery does not charge. I will proceed to return :("
"An ideal size and new without scratches or damage"
"They say it's unlocked from factory and it's not true."
"Not working with metro pcs"
"When it arrived very good, within 15 days of its use it went out and it didn't work anymore I already returned it but I'm very disappointed"
"It doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
"It's no use. It's fast and slow."
"I do not like the thickness of the mobile phone, to be latest and high-end, very thick. (Same thickness of the mobile phones in the last 4 years) I did not come headphones, and in the description indicates that they would come hands-free. Something slow in certain apps. Fingerprint reader very well. Easy recognition very well. Battery life similar to that of Galaxy Note 8 (The one I have used for almost 4 years) I will not buy Samsung again, I will try Apple."
"I don't recommend you don't spend your money on this crap."
"I love it I get very well as new no scratch sign or nothing The only thing I missed was the connector only the cable came to me"
"I liked it, the bad thing was that I saw him later at a cheaper $80 store..."
"It's pretty good, I arrived in perfect condition, so far it works great, it's pretty definite and it comes well packed"
"My wife loved this because her previous phone was damaged, she used it a lot so she was looking for a phone that had good battery and lots of space. This one turned out to be perfect for her."
"It's good the phone what owes me are the photos sometimes don't go well from there all fluid although it lacks a certain application as an example to be able to record the conversation"
"Good fact, beautiful details, its function under water is very useful.Very fast I have not frozen even once in 3 weeks of recommended use."
"The phone is good but before the month the charging system was damaged and instead of changing the whole phone... they changed only the charging system... I think that if something is not working well. They should change it for a new one."
"I'm very happy with my new samsung S20 FE 5G but there's something I didn't find in the box where I came and it's very important to me: THE GUARANTEE."
"The battery life with the just reaches 1 day"
"I have been using it for more than two weeks and I have no problem at all. It came from an S7 Edge and the jump is incredible, the battery lasts up to 10 hours of screen with my normal use, the screen fluidity in the 120 Hz is noticeable and makes it generally feel much faster the entire interface and the use of applications.For me it is no problem that the back part is made of plastic as it seems to me that it still feels very good at hand and does not lose the look of premium cell phone, plus it is more resistant than the glass to falls.It has unlambric charge, reversible charge and a 15W fast load charger, which could be included in the box already for the price, but it is not too dramatic.The cameras are very well in definition and quality and in general is a large phone for daily use. Recommended."
"Almost 2 months of using it works perfect, meeting all the standards of a cell phone in this range. The only but that would give it would be the weight that makes it a little uncomfortable, but the battery will last me between an entire day of continuous use to 2 days of little use.Pd: I bought you a 500G SD and it works perfect."
"*Review EditedAfter several days of use I can bring you a better reviewStatic Apart:I love the design of the mobile phone, it feels comfortable and looks niceThe screen Super AMOLED with 120Hz is the best you have seen, it is the best you have seen, it looks every color and the fluency is exceptionalThe material feels plastic but I buy a case, although I would not have bothered you all the same way since it is comfortable but for sure I have the case, I recommend you to put a mica because by accident a coin gave you a slight scratch to the screenBattery:The subject matter of battery, many users comment that it is finished quickly when the battery can last all the day even with the active 120hz you only need to update the software, the mobile makes the rest of learning your usage patterns and so to use the battery better so you don't have to worry, you can make your own configurations to give you several nuances to use of the battery, 4500mah is enough for your day."
"I have practically a week with the team and I do not regret anything, I come from a galaxy s8+ and the jump is very good, I wanted a s20+ but after so many analysis videos that I saw I decided for this s20 faith since it does not ask anything for the plus, only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be little in contact with that part. I am going in between parts: it has: wireless charge, reversible charge, mexico, mexico, , it is only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be in contact with that part. I am going in the following parts:It has: wireless load, reversible charge, mexico 865, waterproof, water resistant and dust, 6 of ram, 128 of storage, rate of soft 120, screen Amoled, battery 4500 mha, battery 4500 mha, Charger 4500 mha, Charger 4500 mha, but 15w I recommend you to you to buy one of 25w when you buy one of 25w when you you ask when you ask your order to have your order to have a 25w when you if you you ask you if you need to have to have a super fast charge for you super fast charge super fast charge, since you you charge super fast charge, since you can you can super fast charge, since that you can you can you can you can you can charge, it is no fast charge, that you can no fast charge, it is, it is no fast charge, it is what you is what you is, it is what you is no fast charge, it is the time you is the time you is the phone, it is no fast, the time, the time, the time, the time, the time, the entry, the entry no fast, the entry no fast, the entry no fast because that is what is what is what is what is what is the time you is the entry is the entry is the entry any time you is the entry is the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry no time any time you is the entry is the entry is the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry, the entry is the entry is the entry the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry is the entry"
"First of all you should check which is the seller because for this phone there are like 5 or more suppliers, in the picture the color blue appears but to me I get a pink color, the truth does not bother me but if it is a point to consider.The functionality is good, the camera is also quite good, I think that in general it meets the expectations except for the battery, the battery lasts little in reality, looking on the internet apparently this is normal, not only in this Samsung S20 Fe but in other models of the same Samsung, it gives you approx 6 to 7 hours of active screen with the HZs in 60, for 1 day it reaches well but I think that we all expect more being this a model 2020"
"I get the order relatively fast in less than a week, all well so far I hope not to find any fault and return it, until right now it goes well if it is new that seems (come in your box) , finally all well, the only problem is the battery does not last home anything , in first place it takes almost 2 hours to charge to 100% as soon as you turn the battery on it starts to collapse and that I discourage very much, I had many expectations of this cell phone, the truth the battery if it is an aspect of great relevance to me"
"The bad thing is that it's not so fast in response. Very nice camera capture imagesIf I recommend it"
"Just buy it and the phone arrived in good condition and according to the characteristics mentioned in the publication, try with two different sims which were Telcel and AT&T and worked without problems the only problem is that the charger came from the European version but with an adapter there is no problem and respects its fast load."
"The media could not be loaded. The phone came super fast and I bought it for an excellent price $13.500 plus or less. The screen is very good and it does not ask anything to the other models s20. I have an answer to the screen the only thing that has happened to me is that a couple of times after unlocking it does not recognize my gestures or when I touch the screen in some parts, I do not know why. Out of that I work wonderfully the answer so much that COD mobile game. The sound is very good because it has a pair of louds with stereo sound that makes you have a great experience when consuming multimedia content. The security methods work well, nothing from the other world but well. Out of that I still prefer the physical fingerprint reader that has integrated but it takes a couple of seconds to respond. The facial unlocking is good but it could be better. The cameras are very good and you can record to 60 fps in 4k. The security methods work well, nothing from the other world but well well. I still do not have stabilization in this setting but for a static take it goes great. The front camera is very good and recognizes and recognizes the face recognizes to know the face to know if you takes a couple to know if you need to know if you need to know if you have to know if you have to expand you have to expand you have to expand the take full use the take you to expand the take you need to expand the take you to expand the take the take you take you take you take you take you take the take the take the take the take take take take take it in case you take take take take take take take take take it in case you make the take it you take take take take take take take take take it you take you if you if you make the case you make the case you make the case you I am you make the case you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make the case you make you make you make you make you make you make you make the case you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make you make the case you make the case you make you make you make you make you make you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make the picture you make"

"Yes, this equipment has the Snapdragon 865 processor and 5G, I asked Amazon Mexico directly and comes with a 15W charger inside the box. I asked for the lavender color and although a sector complained that the lid is plastic not even noticed, to the touch it feels of a very good and semi premium material that looks excellent and the lavender color looks beautiful. Now speaking of performance, it is very powerful. It runs heavy games with a fluidity that amazes, I have not had any problem of overheating and the few times that it increased its temperature, it dropped very fast. The battery, depending on the use you give it and the fluidity that you have activated on the screen (120 hz or 60hz), can vary between 7 and up to 10 hours of screen, in my case it is enough to arrive at the end of the day (I always have on the 120 Hz and even the Bluetooth and the battery does not drain fast). The rear camera is very good for photo and video, although the front camera for selfies could be better, but I do not complain much as it does an acceptable job."
"It's got the Snapdragon processor, it's 5g, it came in with cable and charger."
"Without negative details, I am satisfied with the purchase because if you have the snapdragon processor, I had no problem with the network provider"
"The battery is pathetic. The phone does arrive new and with the battery status at 100, it's just that the battery handling of the phone itself is ridiculously bad. If autonomy is not a problem for you, buy it. If you can't be charging it every 5 hours, find another option."
"It is a good option ahun in 2022. As this model has the Snapdragon 865 processor therefore supports 5G. One of the things that most analyzed was the quality of the cameras and although they are of 12MPx the quality is very superior than those of 48MPx, analyze this in depth and I can say that it is worth it. It has unlambric load and is submersible to the water for 30 min max to a prof of 1.5mts. Tamien brings the option of unlocking by dijital footprint which works well dry, while the unlocking by facial recognition is very fast. The audio seems very good to me but not because it says q is stereo if it only counts with 1 hole of the horn... The only drawback is that it brings Gorilla Glass 3 so that I recommend you q you put a screen protector to minimize the one that breaks in a fall. I buy it in April 2022 by 10,100 pesos Mx."
"An excellent phone. I arrive the one I asked for, before the scheduled delivery date. Galaxy S20 FE It is the 5G version although in my region there is no 5G, with snapdragon, and it works perfectly with the Telcel chip in Mexico. It comes in its normal sealed box, its USB cable and charger, and brings its pinchito, but it does not bring cover. I already have a week using it and without problem, what you notice is that the battery consumption is more than the previous one that had the Galaxy A71, and what strange is that it does not bring input for hearing aid 3.5, now I will have to buy an adapter to record the videos with flap microphone. Its cost was 11999 Mexican pesos and had the option to pay with card months without interest."
"I came up with 15% battery, in what was set up I stayed at 3%, I charge it at 100%, after 1 hour of just using instagram I stay at 65% only using instagram! I can't imagine using games or apps"
"My last cell phone was a Xiaomi, with the same 6GB and 128GB storage features, only that the Snapdragon of this samsung is 865, and the truth is I don’t feel the substantial change in performance, it feels just as fast. I can say that I don’t feel that this Samsung is of better quality than a Xiaomi with the same features. Another thing is the camera, the selfies of my other cell had 20MP of the front camera and this is 32MP, I made the comparison of the shots and I liked it more as they went out in my Xiaomi. What I don’t discuss with this cell is the back camera, it’s good, but the phone gets very hot when using the camera. To finish, I feel that the battery doesn’t last long nor because I activated the energy saving mode and I didn’t use cell to play it, I don’t have any game in my cell. And for the price, the truth was bought me another xiaomi with better performance, but I wanted to try the samsung for its cameras and the truth is not worth the camera. I didn’t use it’s to play, I didn’t have any game to play, I didn’t have any game game in my cellu’t have any game. I didn’t have a cheap but in my cellu’s voice I said in me."
"I am frustrated not being able to activate the double sim. I have other mobiles with double sim. And I had never ""broken"" my head trying to solve this problem. Still not able to solve it. Otherwise totally satisfied. I hope someone can help me with some secret or trick to solve this problem."
"I got super fast, even though it was brought from the United States, all well sealed, if I got it with the Snapdragon 865 processor which is the 5GSuper version recommended"
"5 days ago I got my Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. I was impressed as I arrived earlier than expected. I arrived the team in good condition and totally sealed, with its charger and its cable. I decided to buy this product released since as I understand it comes with the version of Snapdragon. Coming from a Huawei cell phone (and not having access to Google applications) I chose to buy a Samsung in such a way that I had already had Galaxy S3 several years ago. I am fascinated with its screens amoled (samsan characteristic) its quality of image and video, without forgetting its fluidity since it has 120hz (adjustable to 60hz). I find myself satisfied with the purchase, however, the only ""but"" I put it on is... I have read other comments that speak of a ""good performance"" and sincerely by working schedule I have given you a basic use, visits to spontaneous social networks during the day. Being already 5 pm I have less than 55% of battery last taking into account that I almost didn't use it on working time. My experience with Samsung's always his battery is bad and I have done and I have to know how much of it."
"I have been using it for about two weeks and I love it! I am not from playing many video games so the Exynos processor is not a problem for me. It arrived in good condition and works excellent. 100% recommended"
"The cell phone would not really disappoint, fulfills all your expectations is very powerful and efficient, it feels the power of its processor snapdragon 865 and the efficiency of the battery is formidable it lasts all 1 working day of 8 hours without any problem you arrive to your home easily with the 30 to 35% of battery with a frequent use of the device during the day. it allows you to jump from application to application quickly and navigate them without which the device is encouraged at any time, it warms up very little except for the games there tends to increase considerably its temperature but it is not in an exaggerated way. The cameras are excellent and count with a resolution and interpretation of colors very balanced and the night mode is a wonder the photos in very dark rooms takes them out as clear as if it was day. But as I said the mobile phone does not disappoint what is already the state in which they send it, since you have checked the cell phone box you do not realize that you do not protect from movements or strokes to the device box that comes in and totally loose."
"Samsung is a guarantee for cell phones."
"Unfortunately the phone comes blocked by AT&T, it is not unlocked from factory, even when I tried to unlock it on the AT&T portal, I get a message that has plan and has not been paid.The seller attended me and although I sent him images and data did not solve the problem, he was attentive and kind, he offered to return it for refund. I did not return it because although it does not update android nor UI for blocking, everything else works well, it is very good equipment."
"I come from an S8 and I was looking to upgrade, opt for this model because it comes with snapdragon processor and 5g compatibility, since in Mexico in official stores only distribute version 4g, in addition to the possibility of memory expansion by means of micro SD has excellent performance, it is very fast and with excellent touch response, the quality of the cameras does not ask anything from the latest models, the battery gives me all day despite spending good time between different applications, excellent purchase."
"It is very good phone, if the correct version arrived (version 5G with snapdragon processor) but clearly it was used because the number of IMEI SV was not in 00 or 01, it was in 20. (This means that it is not new). Also, it came in a box without the original seals. Also, the battery only lasts 6 hours, if you do not mind carrying a power bank with you everywhere, it is a good purchase."
"I opted for this 5G model to replace an S8+, the size is the same and works well, but I chose the S20 and not the S21 because I had seen that this was the latest version with memory expansion using micro SD card, and it turns out that it no longer has expansion, only the SIM card can be added."
"Cell phone's the best in the market."
"The product arrives closed, completely new and in my case, just as I asked. It took very little time for the shipment although for the price, I hoped that the finishing of the cell phone would feel better, but it is more a matter of tastes."
"I've been a convinced user of SAMSUNG for many years, and I've never had one with such a bad phone reception."
"I brought in a Galaxy S8 and I feel like I got better with this Galaxy when it comes to the pictures I said were like a professional camera. I don't think of anything."
"Very good."
"This version has a functional camera that fulfills.The battery doesn't give problems in the day to day.The screen has excellent image resolution and doesn't lock.The signal of the bluetooth is not lost, I use it with a smartwatch and bluetooth audiophones at the same time and I don't suffer disconnections at any time.I haven't had problems with the fingerprint sensor on the screen.It has fast unlambric charge and I ah pulled out of trouble more than once.It's a bit robust when you put a cover on it, it's the only stick that I find it."
"Quality and price"
"I liked what snapdragon processor brings, the materials and above all the price, what I did not like was what in the publication said 8 gb in Ram and brings 6 Gb. Otherwise it was fine even though I came with transparent plastic seals and not Samsumg and that was strange to me, although it was sold and sent by Amazon from the United States."
"My first Samsung cell phone and all great, the charge is not so fast but enough for me, the games how COD and PUBG Mobile runs them to me in ultra HD, gives me 6 hours of continuous play in 120Hz, the camera is very good, as I heard it is the same as the Samsung galaxy s20 Ultra, it does not heat as much as I had heard even being Snapdragon."
"It has the compatible slot for dual sim but does not allow to have dual"
"It would be excellent if it were compatible with Telcel 5G network"
"the design is somewhat dull, but it is what you can expect for a phone of ""high range"" for this price, that if the power and some features are high range but some sections were affected to make the price lower.note: I buy it import by Amazon us and I am happy with the handling of the customs by dhl and Amazon, although OJO before buying review the requirements of its customs"
"I bought it when it was on sale with Samsung USA, I'm really pleased, because the color was the one I wanted and it feels so good. Also this version was the 5G version which makes me even happier, I know that in Mexico we still don't have a 5G network but at least being prepared for when it happens is ideal.I'm very sorry that Samsung Mexico doesn't sell it in 5G version.The question of many is whether it works with the networks of Mexico and the answer is yes, it comes unlocked from factory and to me works very well, I have a Telcel chip."
"It has really been the best phone I have bought, even better than iphones, personally spend many years with iphones, but switch to android phones since Apple increases its prices.This Galaxy S20 FE, has several advantages, I have been two weeks with the phone and it works perfectly, allows me to access it from my PC answering messages and calls without connection problem between PC and phone, takes very good photos, the night mode above all works well.The desktop mode of the phone is perfect for those who work on the daily PC, facilitating us to use resources that we have on our phone from the PC.In short it is worth the phone."
"The equipment is amazing! Very good quality and offers great performance, it is fluid and fast in addition to that its camera is identical to that of an S20+ only that with less zoom (which you do not use so much). It is the best way to acquire this equipment why in Mexico only sell version 4G and with exynos :( but this equipment is the best version (5G and snapdragon) and has a big price difference (I save more than 4,000 pesos unlike buying it in Mexico) The equipment comes sealed and super careful, certainly the best way to buy it."
"It says navy blue but it is lilac. If it is 5G. The slot for SIM and removable memory is the same"
"I loved this cell phone, it has almost everything that a normal S20 would have, although they lowered a few things to keep a price somewhat cheaper, but that does not mean that it is less, since it maintains an excellent performance in its software (with the qualcomm processor) and in terms of photos/videos, have come out very good shots to me I recommend very much"
"I like it, the speed with which the phone arrived before the scheduled date, however I think the sound when having a call and putting the speaker is very low, previously had a S10e, and had better sound, the phone is fast, I think that if the phone is designed for samsung's FAN, it should have included audiophones, even if the price increases a little bit, it becomes very basic to me, I think I would definitely have chosen the S20 Plus, it's much better, and the difference is not much, I think it lacks a little bit in the aesthetics and accessories, it is very very basic, only phone charger."
"A few months ago I bought the S20 plus with exynos and I must say that that cell phone is rubbish. The battery lasted 8 hours in normal use! And 4 hours of screen on. Then I returned it and now I bought this cell phone the S20 FE 5G with snapdragon and it is very different, the battery lasts like 20 hours of normal use and 7.5 hours of screen on (that yes, it lasts that with the 120hrz screen off) but I am satisfied with my purchase. Play PUBG and COD for two hours and it does not heat almost. Then if I recommend it, I have been like 2 months with the"
"The phone has good features of a high-end and does not ask much for the normal S20, the camera is very good, the battery if it lasts long the only thing that weakens a little is the screen, which although it is very good the top of the range is superior, I do not regret the purchase because the ratio quality price is very worth"
"It's good, so far so good. Snapdragon's version is brutal, the battery lasts me the whole day even at 120Hz. The only bad thing is that twice the display touch, it doesn't recognize my finger in certain areas of the screen, I think it's a software problem, we'll have to wait for the samsung ones to fix it."
"The media could not be loaded. I have no problem with the product but it arrived just as it looks in the open photo, that's what I saw when I opened it and took a picture of it. This is terrible taste, I don't know if DHL or customs or what but I don't put all the stars by handling the shipment, the cell phone is super"
"I have no problem with the product but it arrived just as it looks in the open photo, that's what I saw when I opened it and I took a picture of it. This is terrible taste, I don't know if DHL or customs or what but I don't put all the stars by handling the shipment, the cell phone is super"
"I arrive in time and form without any topic on it, it works very well, so far no problem has been presented, I have only been with a few days so I can not give a more extensive comment"
"I like everything so far..but I hate that I feel it heavy and sure that's why I'll change it soon SNif"
"I am delighted with the quality of the cell phone and its functioning, in addition to being super economical compared to flagship, it does not ask anything from the latter for an average user. I went from a Galaxy S8 and the improvement in performance, battery and camera is remarkable, before I came home with minimum battery or sometimes it was turned off, now I arrive with 50-40%. The but that put many reviewers is the plastic back cover but with a good cover neither notes it and the color is very nice. Excellent cell so far."
"I paid a good price for the cell phone, but I didn’t find a good case and I don’t mind not being able to leave it in any soperficie as I’m afraid the cameras will melt. I also thought that the processor would be better and sometimes it happened to me that the screen freezes with certain aps."
"A year ago I bought it, and I'm very satisfied with the cell phone!"
"It is a smartphon that exceeds expectations and excellent quality price ratio."
"I was very pleased with the size, I didn’t think it was bigger than my S10. In question I was pleased to work with what you promise, I was able to pass very quickly all my information from my S10 to my new S20 FE. In bad accessories, they already look like Iphon, only comes the charger no longer brings anything else. In time I arrived much earlier than expected, that’s a great detail."
"If it comes with the processor, color, which specifies the publication, met my expectations, it arrived earlier than expected. Qualified and recommended seller."
"Unfortunately the device that came to me is not 5G, it's just the basic version, I give it 4 stars for that, but really the device is very good"
"Although in the name of the product it claims to be the American version, this comes with an Exynos processor. It is not the Snapdragon 888. Very careful."
"I bought it with Cyber Monday’s offer, arrived two days earlier than expected. If you’re thinking about buying this equipment you should definitely purchase it on Amazon, apart from being cheaper, it’s the American version with Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that compared to the Exynos of the international version offers more battery and better performance"
"I arrived sealed and if it works with chip from Mexico, in fact, in the box it says that it is unlocked by Samsung. I barely have 1 day with it and it has worked well, the shipment did not take long to arrive, it arrived in 3 days. Very safe, although it should also be bought a cover because it does not come included in the box, but out of that everything well."
"Excellent equipment quality, the only drawback is that when imported it was opened in customs upon arrival in Mexico. But I fully understand that it was not the seller’s problem. Even though I arrived open with all the loose contents outside the samsung box everything arrived in good condition."
"Cellular in perfect condition, only packaging not very good, but all good. Something late to receive the product, perhaps by the distances from place to place."
"The cell phone came in closed box completely new, I ah run without any problem and it is original with snapdragon and 5g, although in Mexico we do not yet have line 5g is already ready to receive it, I ah run with telcel and AT&T no problem"
"I didn't like getting a charger where in Mexico. You don't use those contacts."
"It didn't come sealed but I guess because customs opened the package, the phone if it's the right one and it works perfectly so far."
"I needed it with snapdragon as it says in the pens and it comes with exynos"
"I arrived in good condition and weather but according to this it was the s20 fe 5g with snapdragon processor and I came with version ecxynos 4g . Put well your ads allo that sell I could not return it anymore because it was a gift . And no way to remove it from the person who has it"
"It took me a long time to get there, it took me time to get out of customs and I arrived without hearing aids, from there to outside excellent equipment totally new, sealed"
"No problems with the package, it came fully sealed and goes to perfection. Recommended for the price of the snapdragon version, it is more expensive in telcel with everything and they sell the exynos version ..."
"The phone I have had since January and I must say that it has not disappointed me a bit! The camera is very good and there are no faults with the cellular collectivity. 100% I recommend the phone."
"It's one of the phones with the best ""cality-price"" ratio, however I had to return it, mainly because of its ghost touch problems on the screen, not everyone has this detail and in some it is more evident than in others, however in my case it was annoying that using 2 or more fingers on the phone (like writing or playing) suddenly makes unwanted touches on the screen."
"The equipment is very nice, the truth is you don't feel the plastic finish, the performance is very good and the photos you take are very good, the camera has flexibility which makes you have to learn various modes of capture."
"The phone arrived from USA earlier than expected. Although it did not arrive in the best packing conditions, the equipment was completely sealed. So far it has extraordinary performance, especially with snapdragon. The battery, great! has long duration and is charged quickly. 100% recommended."
"It's an excellent phone, if you've used samsung brand phones before."
"it doesn't reach the normal s20, but for the price it's fine"
"The one I asked for really came, although there are still no 5G in Mexico I bought it for the performance of Snapdragon 865 and the phone in general. I only used it one day but it feels excellent and came well protected despite having come out from the USA, recommended."
"Incredible phone quality ratio prices, I decided to leave Apple to try Android and the truth the S20FE 5g left me more than satisfied"
"Excellent, beautiful and very fast, met my expectations, no problem with the sign in Mexico, unlocked and everything perfect, unfortunately it does not bring a cover like the version sold in Mexico, it arrived in 5 days from the USA very well packed."
"Its charge is too slow, I tried with 6 realme charger but also very slow load more than 2 hours connected using the phone and it does not charge nor 80"
"The cell phone works very well but it came with a defect in the ignition button that came loose and over time it ended falling and I no longer have ignition button"
"At first I had doubt to buy it for Mx but I do not regret it, It is an excellent equipment and more for the price you pay for it. I do not regret the purchase and it works at 100%."
"I tried it with att and it worked without any problem, everything is configurable to Spanish. So far everything works well. The 5g is a nice extra since we still do not have networks 5g"
"All excellent but came without audiophones"
"Excellent phone. I love it. Design, hardware and software are great. Of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Maybe the only criticism would be a little bit of cameras. But for the price they’re fine"
"The delivery was super fast, in 3 days I was in my house. I could get it at a super price thanks to the offers of black Friday. Highly recommended, fast and with a high quality camera!"
"16 months of cell phone use and one day the sim card detector stopped working, I went to a center of attention and they told me that maybe someone blocked it for a report of theft, bad and bad with my cell phone that worked well but it broke down as if it had an expiration date."
"very good product, meets the expectations, of very good quality. the delivery ahead of schedule, without any blow or damage to the box, everything in order."
"The phone comes in perfect condition, the box where they send it comes a little big but it has bubble protection apart I got 2 days ahead of schedule Excellent purchase"
"The phone works wonderfully, its design is very elegant and the quality of the photographs are excellent. I am very happy with this device."
"I got super fast to Mexico, in addition to having a good price. The cell phone is excellent, what I loved most was the camera. I give it a rating of 10."
"In my case I still don’t have a year with this Samsung S20 FE 5G phone and the switch on and off has already gone off for no reason. I’ve really taken care of it a lot of falls and abuse, even the original Samsung cover I bought for more protection, which indicates that the malfunction comes from factory. Even more careful when buying the version of USA because for the warranty neither Samsung Mexico (manufacturer) nor Amazon Mexico (seller) want to take responsibility. I was very disappointed by both companies, I’m not going to buy Samsung electronics again and less in Amazon Mexico."
"The publication mentions that it is the 5 G that with Snapdragon as well as the reviews that mention that they have arrived, but unfortunately of me is the version and European with Movistar because of what Exinos owns, the team has come to me well only the annoyance is that they are not sincere or they hang to sell versions that are not, of the team works with the details of the Exinos processor that heats up when you use it, from there on out everything is fine apparently with the cell phone, and the purchase then a great nuisance for giving something that you did not ask, luck with their purchases and hope that they do not waste their time making the return of the product"
"It works perfectly with Telcel in Mexico, good high-end phone with good capabilities at an acceptable price. It arrived in less than a week."
"I got the product right, well taken care of.. only that I came open the cell phone box but if it included everything, this is cable charger bucket and the cell phone, not like that hearing aids or case."
"It arrived before the date which is appreciated, the device works well, it is 5G, Snapdragon processor, without flaws with telcel. I hope I have no flaws, I will update after trying it a time, until now excellent."
"I loved this cell phone. It takes very nice pictures, it doesn’t get hot at all and for what I need it’s super. I’m very satisfied."
"It's a great cell phone, great processor, that's all I was looking for."
"I got in time and shape, heron right now. I didn't have any problems with the team."
"Excellent production, only didn't bring much protection to the box, but it arrived without problem. I entered Telcel chip."
"Excellent phone. I came from a Galaxy S9 and felt the difference. Great battery, super powerful performance, great camera and very good screen."
"Super good product. It works with att in Mexico and goes very well. The camera is not of the best but it is quite decent and acceptable"
"Excellent phone, the box came open but I think it was because it's export and customs sees it."
"Very disappointed, in one of the questions that they ask the seller they ask him if he is dual sim and he says yes. I needed a dual sim team and I encouraged myself to buy it. When he arrives, it turns out that if he has the two tickets to place the sim, however it is only functional one of them. When I started to investigate, it turns out that in the USA dual sim teams are forbidden and so no team coming from there will be dual sim. I need the phone for the job and I don’t have time to return it. But I’m definitely not happy with the product and I feel scammed."
"A complete cellular being of high mid-end the truth goes more to high than medium. The photos are very good and the battery holds me all day."
"I really liked the cell phone the pictures go super well, it was a great purchase, and I got super fast"
"I didn't have any problems and I arrived 2 days before the date to Cancun, everything excellent... I arrived sealed and complete...thank you"
"Excellent team, very fast and powerful, having 5G is a plus waiting for it to arrive in Mexico soon"
"Good phone in performance and price is one of the best, the 5G version is better than the one sold in Mexico by its snapdragon processor"
"Excellent team, came faster than expected, is the Snapdragon version at an incredible price, thanks Amazon USA"
"The product arrived in good condition even days before what the app told me. It works well I recommend it"
"No billing I have days requesting the and I have no answer Also the proximity sensor is failing when I am with a call is turned on and off even though I have it in my ear or with the barely speakers!!"
"I like great product, but I had to pay 2800 in taxes"
"He arrived early, very good cell phone, I have a week with him and I'm delighted."
"The phone's getting really hot."
"Excellent team, so far works 100% without any complaints"
"Excellent quality, perfect cost and benefit. Highly recommended"
"The cell phone came in a badly battered box, without security stamps obviously not new, it's not the 5G go scam, inside everything were bent the protections and others, plus they sell it as if it were the 5G to 14,000 do not buy it"
"Camera, battery, quality calls really good"
"Very good team, I arrived earlier than expected"
"I get auper fast and that's what I ordered completely recommended"
"The cell phone came in very good condition."
"Good product"
"Very good system, good camera"
"The phone was purchased with the seller cell mobile group, does not correspond to the description, the phone I received only supports 4G and the processor was exynos."
"The product arrived incomplete, the audiophones were missing."
"EXCELLENT PRICE AND GREAT COMPREHENSIVE TELEPHONE"
"The best phone quality price"
"Very good option"
"It is not even 5G does not bring the processor they indicate. It says it brings the Snapdragon and actually brings the Exynos 990. I feel mocked by the seller. I want to be given what it says to buy!!!"
"The phone does not load with normal cablbe chargers, only unlambrically and I cannot contact anyone for warranty purposes."
"Cell phone came in open and hit."
"the lens of the camera was broken in a very simple way"
"Only the box and accessories came, the cell phone box came open and the equipment didn't come."
"I like to recommend things that work because that way you help people with my 100% recommended experience"
"The screen freezes"
"Mr. AmazonOn August 2nd of this year I bought a Samsung Galaxy S21+ smartphone in LA, USA, which presents faults in the QR code reader. I have made the diagnosis with Samsung Technical Support here in Lima Peru, where I reside. Samsung's opinion is that I request the warranty from you, or else that I take it to Samsung Technical Service to assess the problem and see if it is fixed.I will thank you for your comments, considering that it is a new team and everything should work.It should be specified that the team has not suffered any damage."
"I have about 2 months of use and that mobile beauty, before buying it I had planned to buy an iPhone 12 pro, but the iPhone for its features and price was very expensive, however when I bought the s21 plus was at 799, a better price compared"
"I bought S21+. The 256gb black and 128gb silver. Both work excellent. I changed from Huawei P20 pro, and you notice quite the difference in speed.The camera is perfect and the battery lasts quite long.The price at the time of purchase was $799 each. Honestly worth the investment.And it comes unlocked.It works in perfect Panama.If you have an old cell phone of more than 3 or 4 years, you will notice the difference in speed."
"For the price it is better to buy the normal s21 as there is not much difference more than the size of the screen"
"I was doubtful about buying the equipment because of the customs issue, but I must say that I received it without problems and it worked with the network of Mexico in my Movistar case, the vdd was a drastic change from having a galaxy s9 to this new one, which I liked the duration of the battery, very happy and I got much cheaper than buying it directly the samsung store"
"It doesn't just carry the rest of the cable right."
"It works smoothly in Venezuela"
"Hello it was a gift, when I got there I wrapped it and I didn't get the phone charger."
"It's nice, but the load is bad and besides it gets very hot."
"Everything perfect, everything worked very well I bought unlocked to use in Ecuador and everything is perfect so far."
"So far all well is snapdragon and it is very good in battery consumption"
"The battery lasts all day, the camera goodisima, should specify that this model does not bring double sim"
"It seems to me with Samsung phones are good and the photos are beautiful."
"This phone is very complete."
"I really liked the battery lasts a long time."
"Very good."
"I love it, the best is samsung."
"I bought the 256 GB American version, and I brought it to my country, Ecuador, the phone 8 days in use, was automatically restarted and what was lit was frozen the screen (it stayed on) and it got hot and I could not turn it off or manipulate it, when I could restart the phone did not re-ignition, total disappointment with the computer, had many expectations. The phone never fell or mojo."
"Open box And says it's not open"
"It really cost me to get my fingerprint. I'm sorry about this inconsistent phone and the super bad signal."
"Excellent product, however like everything else, has its pro and contra. Very good audio, acceptable screen although to download it to Full HD if it is something absurd, perfect speed, as was to be expected from a Samsung cell phone, a great cell phone and more if it is worth 800usd (how to buy it) Do not include charger or hearing aids if it is something that affects, even if you already have one and the camera, I feel that it may have improved a little more."
"I can activate it in Mexico"
"It's excellent."
"I bought it for a gift and he loved it!!"
"Small"
"The camera is good but it is not super woo!The only good thing is the night mode :)"
"I had doubts if I bought it by Amazon USA, but I decided to do it for the price and for the type of processor (Snapdragon) and I was satisfied. Great phone.I had a small unexpected at the time of receiving it from parcel (UPS).When I came I saw that I was carrying the violated Amazon stamps I was not going to receive it, but the parcel company told me that in the customs office they opened it, so it was marked with red letters and they put a tape with green letters from the customs that told UPS MEXICO to replace that of Amazon that they had broken (also in the notifications of delivery of the package appeared that I had entered revision at the customs office), so, I received it and indeed only opened the box that Amazon put, the box where came the phone was intact with its warranty stamps.So, it has remained quiet and checked that the phone was intact, new and sealed.The phone to me seems to be something big, I didn't get used, but it was worth it."
"At first I had my doubts about wanting to buy an imported product because of the possibility (I have seen several cases like this) of theft or lost cell phone, although Amazon always supports all purchases.Trust in chance, I went from uncertainty to action and I do not regret it. It came in less than a month, even when it said it would take longer. Indeed, it is the version of 256 GB of storage and Snapdragon processor. The version sold from the USA. does not come with the power bank as the title says, but you will not need it, really not. Passing then to the cell phone, I do not have much to say. I come from a S10 plus and nothing strange, not even the micro SD card or the jack of headphones. The design, presence and speed of this mobile will make you overlook those details.You have to have eagle eye to notice the resolution of screen lower than your ancestors (I tried it at the side of the S10 plus).The ultra-fast charge is noticed and, for how little that I have used it until now, it seems to give battle with its more than 4 thousand milliampers of cellular.The camera will give away."
"The package arrived well sealed and the cell phone came super safe on your bubble paper, it is appreciated that that security is considered when making the shipments.Of the others no talk, it is a high-end phone, nothing is discussed, an excellent team, also emphasize that the box came sealed, no violated seal or anything like that.Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended!"
"The article arrived fast but the box does not contain the original Samsung stamps just like the phone was with fingerprints and without the label of the serial number and imei, that makes me doubt very much if it is a new or used phone and even if it is reconditioned, for me it is something very annoying since I just had in mishap with a s20 plus that returned because I entered it water as it was reconditioned and bought this to replace the other and I am afraid that the same thing will happen with this device I need to contact Amazon and the seller to clarify if it is new and if I will not return it I will not risk again that I will miss a phone in less than a month"
"I had my doubts to buy this cell phone for Amazon, I doubted that it was really the American version, since I was looking for this version with Snapdragon processor and besides that it had a very good price to be true. But the truth everything went excellent, the cell phone arrived as specifications and I could validate it without problems. Excellent cell phone, what I like most is the 120hz refresh rate."
"Everything in perfect condition, 100% functionality, I loved the 21+, the only detail is that they do not deliver the Power Bank 10,000 mah, only the S21+ cell phone arrives, they delivered it earlier than scheduled"
"Sucking on the phone, I had my doubts if it would be worth it as it came from a Galaxy S9, which is brutality and still rifando, but if you have the opportunity to buy it, go ahead, you will be delighted, detail as to sound as I hear it sounded powerful, yet it sounds just like the S9, from there on out, a phone brutalityP.D. Written from my Galaxy S21 Plus"
"Very good arrived in 1 week, I already completed another week of use and has perfectly surrendered the battery holding even more than a day. The screen is big but surely you can hold it and write it with one hand. It comes sealed and works perfect with the Telcel network here in Mexico. (Eye brings cable but no power adapter)"
"I arrived in perfect condition, original 100%, the power bank did not come but Amazon knew how to fix that inconvenience.This equipment was Snapdragon, unlocked.I have been in use for about 15 days and so far everything perfect with the cell phone and at an excellent price comparing it with the equipment offered in Mexico.More later I will be updating this post."
"I've been on my cell phone for a month now and it's pretty fast, in fact it brings the snapdragon. The camera is amazing though if I have to say that the zoom of 30x fails, but the cell phone is cool."
"Very good phone, delivers everything you would expect from a Samsung badge, detected me the VoLTE and the 4.5G network just when placing the Telcel SIM card, the 120Hz screen is excellent, although I notice that energy consumption increases by enabling that option."
"I liked the big camera, the screen size and the price"
"Excellent team worked well, arrived in good condition, faster than the estimated delivery date said, I am in Mexico and was compatible with telcel"
"Excellent cell phone, your snapdragon processor is quite put on, the cell phone battery practically lasts all day"
"For the price I was at, I had doubts as to whether I was reliable but now that I have the product I don't regret it at all."
"It works perfect in Mexico, a great price and I put Chip Telcel and it works great."
"Excellent product, arrived early, sealed, the only thing that is needed to the cell phone is that it can fly :v"
"It came in excellent condition. It works totally well. With the Crystal sheath of spigen it looks super good."
"It's great!! I love everything you do and the ease of nanejo"
"I bought the cell phone on February 2021 and for July it didn't turn on the screen, I repaired it on Samsung and now in October again it doesn't turn on the screen, if you're from MX they won't make you valid the warranty on Samsung MX and the cost of repair is 7 thousand pesos and the opinion of the damage is that some updates aren't compatible with the screen... if you're from MX or another country other than USA don't buy it, save yourself money and hassle."
"Excellent service and excellent phone."
"Quality product"
"The cell phone only worked 3 months apart from this time I present failure turned off the screen and so far I realize that it is not the first time that happens since there are more comments about it.Wrong by Amazon they should have a better filter with their sellers as it has more than 2 weeks that the device was returned and I have no answer from anyone nor refund any."
"Amazing product"
"I asked for support from SAMSUNG and via remote they connected to the phone and told me that it is not double sim..."
"The 10/10 device, but I didn't get the powerbank, and Amazon didn't fix anything. They turned a blind eye."
"I was satisfied with my phone but no longer receives calls, I think having paid so much failure very soon that does not allow me to retrust"
"It is ral and as I expected it charm me do not hesitate to buy it"
"Excellent, the equipment arrived before the expected time, according to the specifications, with its packaging with original stamps. I would buy back my equipment with this seller and recommend it widely."
"The cell phone came to me earlier than planned in perfect condition, in closed box with Samsung stamps, for my needs this perfect, excellent service, I highly recommend to Karlitashop, as I also send my invoice in time and form."
"Very bad zoom, very ugly photos!!!, a disappointment, for the price!!!"
"The reliability is used and with improvements that are advertised on camera and screen. Increased refresh rate is felt. The battery would be the weak point, because although it is not bad, it does feel short for a phone at the top of the range."
"Without a doubt it is an excellent equipment, perhaps the autonomy of its battery is not the best, but its camera, processor and especially the screen has nothing to envy to other terminals."
"Very nice, premium materials, excellent night photography, suitable size, is fast, the battery doesn't last so long for the price..."
"Fast shipping, product as described! I am international buyer, I am very pleased"
"The phone has a very nice model 10, the weight, the quality dw the materials. But they are not enough to compare price and quality. The screen compared to cellular oytos is seen with a little less brightness in the light, I bought it since I thought it was the best option for photographs and videos and I still believe that yes, but there are equally important aspects when choosing and staying with a cell phone, especially if it costs you on average $1200 usd. All the comparison made with my old huawei 30. Its extremely deficient battery, lasted at a very 5 hours with screen on and that changed the configuration to save energy. The phone is heated with just keeping a video call, that also makes the battery consume faster, I get with a defect dd makes a small stain on the screen that was not something alarming to continue using it why while it was on was almost imperceptible, the audio is not the best and worst, one day I take an airplane and for some reason when I get off the same bocina had broken, I definitely opt good ppwee back to my old."
"All right."
"Excellent product worth every penny invested"
"Horrible battery"
"I expected better performance but it's okay"
"A good buy and a 10 out of 10"
"The battery lasts long enough if you don't use it, but the regular use I give the cell phone consumes the battery a lot, but from everything else I loved the cell phone"
"It was the best. Excellent service."
"All good in time and form"
"I love it, it feels great. Everything works great. Super recommended."
"It's no use. It doesn't last the battery."
"I recommend this cell phone."
"Very agile delivery and the price was very good"
"The best in cameras and performance in the market."
"As a mobile device I cannot wish for more, its latest generation specifications, its good battery durability (this one has to give it a week or so to suit your way of using it as it is smart), its excellent building materials and even its cameras left me nothing to want."
"The team already knew him and it's a wonder however the seller first says that he has international warranty and in samsung do not validate the warranty, he would have to have an invoice from USA so that he could make valid my warranty and it would be a problem to do all that, unfortunately the seller lies in that part and I had to return the product."
"Excellent, all well packed and arrived earlier than estimated"
"Excellent phone super recommended!!"
"It's very good phone to take pictures, videos and above all watch movies and be able to draw with the spin, but for what I really buy it it is to play games like Mobile Legends and Lol its performance I didn't like"
"I am very satisfied with the equipment, comes sealed the box and everything new as announced by the publication 1000% I recommend them, I arrive ahead of time and all well"
"I arrive sealed and new. Everything in order and to this day is a plane. There were no issues in the purchase or delivery already with code, that if I opened it in front of the delivery man and like that he does not like but understands that they have had bad handlings some. I could also bill without issues the purchase."
"Excellent cell phone, the best Android of 2022. Worth it and is reliable this seller, the team came to me new"
"The most important thing! I arrive in perfect condition, new and sealed factory, very good phone, the only detail would be the performance of the battery, in my case I arrived with Qualcom processor"
"So far all well, met my expectations and the delivery was very fast."
"All in order."
"It came sealed, the right color, the spectacular screen. The device is unlocked and accepts the 5G network without problem. The version is correct with that of USA, my only surprise (not bad) is that this cell phone is dual SIM."
"Excellent purchase, take it in promotion, for 25 is a good purchase, heats up a little every certain time, the battery does not last long, use continuous maybe 4 hrs with full battery, still it is good purchase"
"The package arrived well, asked for password, the phone is in excellent condition, sealed, new. The S22 does not bring charger, only the cable type C. So far the phone works perfect, and arrived in the time estimated by the App."
"Touch quality, great battery performance, excellent cameras. A very good purchase"
"Purchase 100% recommended, arrive sealed equipment and in perfect condition. A good purchase"
"Be careful to be scammed, if you are going to make this purchase before giving the code to receive the package, take evidence from the delivery man and unit. Since in my case it was up to me to receive the package without the equipment inside, it came only box of the cell phone with USB cable and manuals. If possible, open the package so that you have all the necessary evidence in case I passed the same thing. I am now in water and waiting for my purchase refund to be made."
"Cell phone doesn't seem to be new, it comes scratched from the sides, and doesn't bring Samsung's original stamps."
"They sent me the wrong color; even the box is marked as Phantom Black. I don't know if the phone is reconditioned; the stamps that came in the box I think are not Samsung's originals. The phone appears for sale as ""new"". Otherwise the phone has worked well."
"1. The color that the publication says is black and I got a gray color 2. The cell phone is from Canada not from US. I returned it because it was not what I asked for based on the publication."
"They say q is dual sim and it's not true"
"Perfect device"
"Excellent purchase"
"Quick"
"Excellent."
"Excellent cell phone"
"Excellent."
"I like it."
"Large cell phone"
"Excellent."
"Beautiful."
"Excellent cell phone!! I loved it!!"
