This almost at the height of the new ultra s22 and the truth is that it does not ask anything. And you even save almost 8,000 pesos. It works well with the telcel network. I definitely recommend it.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone to be able to play Call of Duty Mobile. I was tempted to buy another terminal, designed specifically for that purpose. But in the end I decided for Samsung by its style that it is quite more refined and because, on paper, its features were similar. A good chip and a good screen with high cup of soda. Unfortunately the phone has had some faults. At first it was software. Problems with Google Play, with discord and now with the reading of sim card. I must restart the phone so that the calling, messaging and Internet services work. It’s a shame. Besides the facial recognition and fingerprint reading software on screen is really bad. Finally, the connectivity with accessories from brands other than Samsung is quite bad. I have a Xiaomi wristband and the connection between the phone and the band and unstable. I must be opening the mifit application for you to download information constantly.","en"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using it for more than two weeks and I have no problem at all. It came from an S7 Edge and the jump is incredible, the battery lasts up to 10 hours of screen with my normal use, the screen fluidity in the 120 Hz is noticeable and makes it generally feel much faster the entire interface and the use of applications.For me it is no problem that the back part is made of plastic as it seems to me that it still feels very good at hand and does not lose the look of premium cell phone, plus it is more resistant than the glass to falls.It has unlambric charge, reversible charge and a 15W fast load charger, which could be included in the box already for the price, but it is not too dramatic.The cameras are very well in definition and quality and in general is a large phone for daily use. Recommended.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Almost 2 months of using it works perfect, meeting all the standards of a cell phone in this range.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","*Review EditedAfter several days of use I can bring you a better reviewStatic Apart:I love the design of the mobile phone, it feels comfortable and looks niceThe screen Super AMOLED with 120Hz is the best you have seen, it is the best you have seen, it looks every color and the fluency is exceptionalThe material feels plastic but I buy a case, although I would not have bothered you all the same way since it is comfortable but for sure I have the case, I recommend you to put a mica because by accident a coin gave you a slight scratch to the screenBattery:The subject matter of battery, many users comment that it is finished quickly when the battery can last all the day even with the active 120hz you only need to update the software, the mobile makes the rest of learning your usage patterns and so to use the battery better so you don't have to worry, you can make your own configurations to give you several nuances to use of the battery, 4500mah is enough for your day.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have practically a week with the team and I do not regret anything, I come from a galaxy s8+ and the jump is very good, I wanted a s20+ but after so many analysis videos that I saw I decided for this s20 faith since it does not ask anything for the plus, only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be little in contact with that part. I am going in between parts: it has: wireless charge, reversible charge, mexico, mexico, , it is only the subject that the back part is made of plastic but let us be honest the majority will occupy it with cover so you will be in contact with that part.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First of all you should check which is the seller because for this phone there are like 5 or more suppliers, in the picture the color blue appears but to me I get a pink color, the truth does not bother me but if it is a point to consider.The functionality is good, the camera is also quite good, I think that in general it meets the expectations except for the battery, the battery lasts little in reality, looking on the internet apparently this is normal, not only in this Samsung S20 Fe but in other models of the same Samsung, it gives you approx 6 to 7 hours of active screen with the HZs in 60, for 1 day it reaches well but I think that we all expect more being this a model 2020","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I get the order relatively fast in less than a week, all well so far I hope not to find any fault and return it, until right now it goes well if it is new that seems (come in your box) , finally all well, the only problem is the battery does not last home anything , in first place it takes almost 2 hours to charge to 100% as soon as you turn the battery on it starts to collapse and that I discourage very much, I had many expectations of this cell phone, the truth the battery if it is an aspect of great relevance to me","en"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Yes, this equipment has the Snapdragon 865 processor and 5G, I asked Amazon Mexico directly and comes with a 15W charger inside the box. I asked for the lavender color and although a sector complained that the lid is plastic not even noticed, to the touch it feels of a very good and semi premium material that looks excellent and the lavender color looks beautiful. Now speaking of performance, it is very powerful. It runs heavy games with a fluidity that amazes, I have not had any problem of overheating and the few times that it increased its temperature, it dropped very fast. The battery, depending on the use you give it and the fluidity that you have activated on the screen (120 hz or 60hz), can vary between 7 and up to 10 hours of screen, in my case it is enough to arrive at the end of the day (I always have on the 120 Hz and even the Bluetooth and the battery does not drain fast). The rear camera is very good for photo and video, although the front camera for selfies could be better, but I do not complain much as it does an acceptable job.","en"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery is pathetic. The phone does arrive new and with the battery status at 100, it's just that the battery handling of the phone itself is ridiculously bad. If autonomy is not a problem for you, buy it. If you can't be charging it every 5 hours, find another option.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a good option ahun in 2022. As this model has the Snapdragon 865 processor therefore supports 5G. One of the things that most analyzed was the quality of the cameras and although they are of 12MPx the quality is very superior than those of 48MPx, analyze this in depth and I can say that it is worth it. It has unlambric load and is submersible to the water for 30 min max to a prof of 1.5mts. Tamien brings the option of unlocking by dijital footprint which works well dry, while the unlocking by facial recognition is very fast. The audio seems very good to me but not because it says q is stereo if it only counts with 1 hole of the horn... The only drawback is that it brings Gorilla Glass 3 so that I recommend you q you put a screen protector to minimize the one that breaks in a fall. I buy it in April 2022 by 10,100 pesos Mx.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","An excellent phone. I arrive the one I asked for, before the scheduled delivery date. Galaxy S20 FE It is the 5G version although in my region there is no 5G, with snapdragon, and it works perfectly with the Telcel chip in Mexico. It comes in its normal sealed box, its USB cable and charger, and brings its pinchito, but it does not bring cover. I already have a week using it and without problem, what you notice is that the battery consumption is more than the previous one that had the Galaxy A71, and what strange is that it does not bring input for hearing aid 3.5, now I will have to buy an adapter to record the videos with flap microphone. Its cost was 11999 Mexican pesos and had the option to pay with card months without interest.","en"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My last cell phone was a Xiaomi, with the same 6GB and 128GB storage features, only that the Snapdragon of this samsung is 865, and the truth is I don’t feel the substantial change in performance, it feels just as fast. I can say that I don’t feel that this Samsung is of better quality than a Xiaomi with the same features. Another thing is the camera, the selfies of my other cell had 20MP of the front camera and this is 32MP, I made the comparison of the shots and I liked it more as they went out in my Xiaomi. What I don’t discuss with this cell is the back camera, it’s good, but the phone gets very hot when using the camera. To finish, I feel that the battery doesn’t last long nor because I activated the energy saving mode and I didn’t use cell to play it, I don’t have any game in my cell. And for the price, the truth was bought me another xiaomi with better performance, but I wanted to try the samsung for its cameras and the truth is not worth the camera.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","5 days ago I got my Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. I was impressed as I arrived earlier than expected. I arrived the team in good condition and totally sealed, with its charger and its cable. I decided to buy this product released since as I understand it comes with the version of Snapdragon. Coming from a Huawei cell phone (and not having access to Google applications) I chose to buy a Samsung in such a way that I had already had Galaxy S3 several years ago. I am fascinated with its screens amoled (samsan characteristic) its quality of image and video, without forgetting its fluidity since it has 120hz (adjustable to 60hz). I find myself satisfied with the purchase, however, the only ""but"" I put it on is... I have read other comments that speak of a ""good performance"" and sincerely by working schedule I have given you a basic use, visits to spontaneous social networks during the day. Being already 5 pm I have less than 55% of battery last taking into account that I almost didn't use it on working time. My experience with Samsung's always his battery is bad and I have done and I have to know how much of it.","en"

The cameras are excellent and count with a resolution and interpretation of colors very balanced and the night mode is a wonder the photos in very dark rooms takes them out as clear as if it was day.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had doubts if I bought it by Amazon USA, but I decided to do it for the price and for the type of processor (Snapdragon) and I was satisfied. Great phone.I had a small unexpected at the time of receiving it from parcel (UPS).When I came I saw that I was carrying the violated Amazon stamps I was not going to receive it, but the parcel company told me that in the customs office they opened it, so it was marked with red letters and they put a tape with green letters from the customs that told UPS MEXICO to replace that of Amazon that they had broken (also in the notifications of delivery of the package appeared that I had entered revision at the customs office), so, I received it and indeed only opened the box that Amazon put, the box where came the phone was intact with its warranty stamps.So, it has remained quiet and checked that the phone was intact, new and sealed.The phone to me seems to be something big, I didn't get used, but it was worth it.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","At first I had my doubts about wanting to buy an imported product because of the possibility (I have seen several cases like this) of theft or lost cell phone, although Amazon always supports all purchases.Trust in chance, I went from uncertainty to action and I do not regret it. It came in less than a month, even when it said it would take longer. Indeed, it is the version of 256 GB of storage and Snapdragon processor. The version sold from the USA. does not come with the power bank as the title says, but you will not need it, really not. Passing then to the cell phone, I do not have much to say. I come from a S10 plus and nothing strange, not even the micro SD card or the jack of headphones. The design, presence and speed of this mobile will make you overlook those details.You have to have eagle eye to notice the resolution of screen lower than your ancestors (I tried it at the side of the S10 plus).The ultra-fast charge is noticed and, for how little that I have used it until now, it seems to give battle with its more than 4 thousand milliampers of cellular.The camera will give away.","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The package arrived well sealed and the cell phone came super safe on your bubble paper, it is appreciated that that security is considered when making the shipments.Of the others no talk, it is a high-end phone, nothing is discussed, an excellent team, also emphasize that the box came sealed, no violated seal or anything like that.Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended!","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The article arrived fast but the box does not contain the original Samsung stamps just like the phone was with fingerprints and without the label of the serial number and imei, that makes me doubt very much if it is a new or used phone and even if it is reconditioned, for me it is something very annoying since I just had in mishap with a s20 plus that returned because I entered it water as it was reconditioned and bought this to replace the other and I am afraid that the same thing will happen with this device I need to contact Amazon and the seller to clarify if it is new and if I will not return it I will not risk again that I will miss a phone in less than a month","en"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had my doubts to buy this cell phone for Amazon, I doubted that it was really the American version, since I was looking for this version with Snapdragon processor and besides that it had a very good price to be true.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone has a very nice model 10, the weight, the quality dw the materials. But they are not enough to compare price and quality. The screen compared to cellular oytos is seen with a little less brightness in the light, I bought it since I thought it was the best option for photographs and videos and I still believe that yes, but there are equally important aspects when choosing and staying with a cell phone, especially if it costs you on average $1200 usd. All the comparison made with my old huawei 30. Its extremely deficient battery, lasted at a very 5 hours with screen on and that changed the configuration to save energy. The phone is heated with just keeping a video call, that also makes the battery consume faster, I get with a defect dd makes a small stain on the screen that was not something alarming to continue using it why while it was on was almost imperceptible, the audio is not the best and worst, one day I take an airplane and for some reason when I get off the same bocina had broken, I definitely opt good ppwee back to my old.","en"
