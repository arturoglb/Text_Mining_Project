"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received the iPhone in an acceptable condition, there was a few scratches and for some reason the screen touch felt heavy that's why I returned."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came well packaged but was missing a brick for the charger! The phone was in great condition though! Good value for the price!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was partly deceived"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Besides the one I got having only 82% battery capacity, this is a really good phone for a nice price."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Okay Reviewers I ordered this IPhone 11 Pro Max off of my sons prime account.. This is one bad ass phone! And I got a great deal from this amazing company! Shipping was on point! And this phone OMG perfect! Like it came from Apple! If I didn’t know it was refurbished? I would have thought it was never touched! That’s how perfect it is! I felt like a child at Christmas! Stoked! So, definitely would and will buy from this company again! Thank you for your loyalty to your customers! Super excited! Placed it in a case as soon as I looked at it .
Okay about the iPhone 11 Pro Max .. outside of it’s beauty . Wish I could take a picture of it , but i can’t . I’m on it..
the 11 is holding its value for great reasons .. it really is a bad ass phone !! And the 12’s are nice but the 11’s sit right next to those 12’s ! But cheaper in price but the quality is all the same!
The pictures are amazing!!! ( FYI My son has the 12 My sister 12 pro and brother in law has 12 pro Max ) so pictures are not so noticeably different.. cause this 11 pro Max takes great photos also and the battery life is awesome ! 24 hrs no charge and still had life left! I have charged it with the cord charging ( it came with a good charging cord not junk) and I also have charged it with the magnetic cordless charging.. about the same.
I have not done the face recognition as of yet.. I use a passcode.. I do miss the finger / thumb recognition button but from what I see with my son ? Face recognition is prob just as fast or faster?
The speakers on this is loud! Love it!
Now yes this is a bigger device it is a 6.5 in screen but it’s not bulky at all ! The phone is slender not heavy but a case did help tremendously holding it cause it’s so thin.. haha i dont know how to explain that one but I Dont know to drop it haha so a case helps to grip it .. if that makes sense ? Lol
But with the cheaper price tag ? I was able to get the highest GB and still save a few hundred’ dollars!
I did my research cause I was looking at this phone for a while and then was gearing for the 12 pro Max for it has 3 or 4 better features. But After comparing and deep research? What was being said is true! The 11’s are amazing phones! And unless your a Photographer? You won’t see a inkling of a difference with the camera or video.. the processor in the 11’s are also fast and made right! Apple surly did a great job with the 11’s !!! So again for what you get and with that price tag ? You can’t go wrong with the Iphome 11 pro Max! I’m freaking happy I got one heck of a deal ! I love the look ,the quality, how fast it responds, the pictures, the battery life, the features, and the company that I bought it from! Hope this helps with someone’s research and decision making!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got a really good looking phone I’ve got the gold 256 GB and it’s really a upgrade from my old Samsung battery health did come at 85%. I guess that’s decent right other than that it’s a really great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really enjoyed battery life,facial recognition is something new for me enjoying my iPhone very much"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was I nervous to buy a $500 iphone on Amazon? Yes! I am glad I did, the phone arrived in excellent condition, with a screen protector already on. I'm very happy its not cracked or majorly scratched, I recommend buying this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was having a real problem (to me) with the ""Zoom"" feature. I must have been unknowingly touching the screen with three fingers, thus enlarging the font too much for the screen size. After de-selecting that ""Zoom"" feature, I became happy again with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this product! Best refurbished phone I’ve ever purchased works and looks great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","very happy with my purchase... it is perfect !!! thank you!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and it’s been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. I’ve gotten the run around told several different story’s! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still haven’t seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! It’s a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! It’s very aggravating and a headache it’s not $20 or something it’s almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully you’re experience is better!

I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didn’t know it was “renewed” I’d swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and it’s now 4:23pm the next day and it’s still yet to go dead I’ve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but that’s not a big deal I guess. I’ve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! That’s a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud. If ever needed I will definitely come back to this seller with no hesitation at all! I’m just very pleased with everything over all!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente servicio y teléfonos en lo personal tuve un pequeño inconveniente pero inmediatamente me dieron solución 100% recomendado entre mi familia y amigos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good but worth the price !
No issues !
Just need a good charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was in new condition and clean operation when received. Upgraded from 7 Plus. A good jump in speed and quality."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Deben mejorar el nivel de batería y el estado de la pantalla"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy correcto y profesional"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Externally the iPhone I flawless, but the battery is not good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very happy with this purchase. Paid for 256 memory. Received phone with 512 memory. I feel I got a fantastic deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great shape, the only reason for the 4 star is there is nothing on the phone or the packaging with the IMEI number. Made it more difficult to get the device activated because you had to get it hooked up to itunes prior to activating the services with my carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great customer service!!! First phone the volume was low and they returned with no problems. Second phone is perfect!! Will definitely do business again!! Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Its like brand new,"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with everything a new phone comes with, I had absolutely NO PROBLEM placing my SIM card in it and downloading my other iPhone profile and works perfectly !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s too old and little scratches everywhere. It doesn’t look like what I saw on the site."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone worked well overall, until a made a phone call. The main speaker on the top front of the phone that sits on your ear during a call must’ve been busted because it was barely audible. There were about 3 deep scratches on the screen as well, all of those was unexpected as I purchased the “excellent” condition. The battery health was 87%, which was acceptable for a used phone. It was great besides the speaker and scratches which I ultimately returned it because of. Return process was smooth and I got my money back within 3-4 days of shipping my return."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dislike the glitches"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I recommend this product. I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I want to recommend that you choose Sikksound to purchase from! I just ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Max silver Friday, received it the following Monday. When I received the package I was kind of nervous because the packaging was so small, but they had everything packed nice and tidy! I had no problems with my SIM card, it worked immediately, I had a little issue with my Apple ID but I figured it out, nothing to do with the seller. The phone didn’t have a single scratch, it literally looks brand new, LITERALLY! Face ID, touch screen, camera, speaker, everything works! Batter life is at 97%, which is more then I expected! If I ever need to purchase a phone again, I will be purchasing from them! Thank you! 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have this 4 stars because although the phone was on very good condition. When unboxing it comes with a very sticky protective sheet on top of the screen. Upon removing the sheet unlike apple
Leaves a sticky film covering the entire screen. Water or little soap alone was not able to remove this film.
My husband had to use an adhesive remover a few time to completely remove the film."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent condition! Price is great!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in great condition. No cratches. It even had on a screen protector. Phone is currently being used in Jamaica with no issues connecting to the local network."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looks great and even came with its own screen protector like new. I did check my battery life on it and it’s 82"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I try to swipe it barely can swipe I try to purchase on Amazon to confirm my purchase I have to swipe, it won’t allow me to swipe and the letters don’t work properly on key board"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love everything about this phone. Bought it as a gift and they love it. Great condition and great price. Deffinately recommend this phone and this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone only lasted 6 months."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone working pretty good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone itself is very high quality. The graphics are amazing, the apps load quickly, the camera is very nice. The phone is pretty heavy though. I haven’t noticed that with newer iPhone models so if the weight of the phone might be an issue for you, I wouldn’t recommend this one. The product isn’t damaged at all and it came with a SIM card remover tool and a charger and charger box. The shipping for me was difficult though. They kept on pushing forward the delivery date up until I had called and went off on them, then it has gotten to my house on time."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","They liked the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice size"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When it eventually arrived I was pleasantly surprised how good it looked. I have had a couple of instances where the touchscreen hasn’t registered on the first/second touch but other than that it has worked well so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It seems like a brand new phone to me because I can’t tell the difference."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm so happy! At first I was skeptical, because I read some negative reviews! I ended up buying the iphone 11 pro max silver 64gb unlocked and I received what i ordered!! I had an iphone 7 plus, and I bought this with my own money. I'm so happy. I love the camera, good screen with NO scratches, and it's so pretty! Will be recommending to my friends and family! although the phone has 84% battery health, but i honestly don't care. mine old phone was in the 70's lol. :)))))))))))))"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","VERY HAPPY FIND OF THIS PHONE!!
was skeptical about buying an used phone because I always buy the refurbished ones directly from apple but now it was not the case because inflation and prices going up.

Had do give my newest ip 13 and go back to this one due to bad battery and that I didnt like the feel of the ip13 and this really gave my hopes back.

Avant Solutions was my seller and it had all original parts, not icloud locked and, the battery health was at 92% !!!! The listing for these phones guarantees at least more than 80% but this was much better.

As any used phone, it should have knicks and dents and mine only had a small scratch on an edge (presumably because previous owner drop it without a case on) and it came with a tempered glass on!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good price and works perfect! The only reason I had purchased an Android over a month ago was I didn’t want to pay for a bigger iPhone 11. So after a month of working on that droid, I found this iPhone 11 Pro Max at a reasonable price. Always will buy renewed iPhones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Dropped out of my pocket when I sat in a chair (2’ off the ground) and the middle of my screen cracked."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn't expect it to get stuck every few days during important calls or using apps. The screen freezes and occasionally closed out of an app while in use without saving changes or progress. Hardware was in great condition, but using this phone made it difficult to complete tasks, access docs/drives to share, access photos and at the very least mute or increase volume during calls."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought mine from chubbiestech and they did good. The phone had no scratches fully functional and battery health was 87% and it’s pretty good. Other than that it was perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was ok but the screen is faulty. Phone fell with screen protector AND a phone case on. Somehow only the phone screen broke while the screen protector was intact"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the 11 pro max ( obvi lol ) , silver , 256 gb . i was a tiny bit nervous due to some of the negative reviews but i jus got this phone and initially it’s fine to me . it came unlocked , no previous icloud was linked to it . all buttons work fine , camera is fine , face id is fine , volume / speakers are fine . battery capacity is at 87% which is fine cus i currently have an xr , 64 gb , 73% capacity .. so a bit of an upgrade for me . it’s so new to me ( like an hour old ) so i haven’t set it up yet but like i said it came unlocked and the imei number ( or whatever lol ) says “ no sim restrictions “ so i believe it’s unlocked and i don’t believe i’ll have any problems setting it up. like i said i literally jus got the phone but so far i’m really happy & relieved & inlove .. and it came w a bit of mild scratching only on the sides of the phone but i’ll have a case on it anyways , no screen scratches or scratches on the back or on neither cameras . hopefully it lasts a couple years or so and it also has a 90 day return / replacement warranty ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything was just as expected! The product even came with a screen protector and was just as described. Great job!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal use. I like everything for now"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone came in 3 days, perfect condition very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","My only MAJOR complaint is that the speaker is a little damaged. Music sounds staticky and so do phone calls from both ends. But the face recognition, battery life and camera all looks brand new. So you get what you pay for with this one. All in all I definitely don’t regret buying a renewed phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is good but a red dot came on my camera."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a hit and Miss. You can either get a good condition Version or a totally scratched up phone that was previously owend by a cat."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo mejor es el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like in the title this is an amazing phone that works perfectly except for the speaker i mentioned. To clarify the speakers work but the bottom speaker seems to have some water damage because it makes slight static noises and is muffled a bit. Couldn’t find a fix for this but it’s a minor problem compared to everything else. So far, i would recommend paying for the renewed premium option and i’ll update this review if anything major happens."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","You would think spending this much for a used product it would at least be functional, but not the case for this guy. Phone has 82% battery and dropped 50% life sitting in my pocket for 2.5 hours meaning I have 5 hours of max life when not using. Have my appointment to get the battery replaced as I would rather pay $69 for a new one than go through the hassle of a return and repurchase. Based on other reviews it looks like you are rolling the dice in batteries period. Would recommend adding $69 out of pocket for anyone using these refurbished phones. Outside of battery, everything else seems top notch so far. Bought my wife a refurbished from another vendor that came with a new battery and will be going with them next time for my own.Update - seller stated that in the end I purchased a refurbished (so essentially buyer beware in their own words!) and could send it in for a replacement, but cannot guarantee it will be better as it is another refurbish. Still spending the $69 to simply fix the issue with a new battery and would encourage any one purchasing from them to add that to your true total cost. Next time will buy directly from apple with a legit guarantee as my cost to go with this seller is only $100 cheaper in total spent, but now with a clearly lower quality refurbish and customer support team. Not worth the time and hassle and lesson learned."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So for my birthday I was gifted the iPhone 11 which was really nice at first but 3 days in it started to crack. And the longer the day went on the more the cracks started to spread.So had to return that phone which made me very skeptical of getting the iPhone 11 Pro Max instead.I had literally no problems with setting it up or transferring everything, which was such a relief.Have had this phone for a few months and so far no cracks, no scrapes, camera works beautiful, and I can actually hear people when I’m on the phone! The iPhone 11 had TERRIBLE audio and I always had to turn on speaker for calls yet could barely hear.I don’t normally do reviews but this surprised me with how well it’s going. 🙌🏻🥹🥹"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is amazing I’m so happy I ordered from them my phone came so fast and it looked brand new no scratches or anything!! Camera is so clear as well!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very satisfied with the purchase got it today phone was spanking new !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery health was 100% when i got it. This kicks my 2020 SE’s ass for sure"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone in very good condition. Minor scratch on screen but nothing to worry about."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","i gave 4 stars cuz sometimes the phone glitches out and i can’t touch the screen but other than that everything is good. my battery health was at 85 when i got it (may 24) and it’s still at 85."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","My IPhone 11 Pro Max arrived much earlier than the delivery date, the phone looks like new just a tiny scratch in the screen but you don’t eve notice, it come with a different charger but works fine and charge fast, the battery life was 82%, no that bad for a refurbished phone. so far the phone works very well let's see what happens later. But I will definitely buy again from the seller Refoned!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","If you’re like me, you don’t want to get wrapped up in a contract for a brand new phone, but you still want to feel like you’re not far behind the newest iPhone. Well, this is it. I upgraded from the Xr and it’s a night and day difference. The iPhone 11 Pro Max should be the go to for anyone looking to stay in the ballpark of $500 for a phone. I feel as though this phone will still still be relevant for a while."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone has issues with the earpiece unless I use hands free or EarPods I have to use the speaker I like the memory space"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","To be honest I can't really rate the product due to the fact that I haven't had the phone for a month. So far so good ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pristine condition with 100% battery health, thanks Amazon for another great iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I RARELY leave any reviews but I'm DISAPPOINTED because I paid the extra money for the ""excellent condition"" to avoid things like this. (sorry for the pictures. hard to capture the dents on such a shiny surface, tried to include flash and no flash pics and this might be a little long)Straight out the box, there is not only a scratch on one of the back cameras that shows up through pictures, (I checked) and another one on the surrounding glass of all three cameras on the back but also the front-facing camera has little DENTS/DIVETS. The ENTIRE device has these little dents all throughout the phone. Many of them are scattered over the screen, a cluster of them on the back (that I forgot to take a picture of), HOWEVER, the sides are the worst. It is pretty noticeable, even from a foot or 12 inches away as the description described. I'm not even sure what could cause that because on the sides it mostly looks internal. It is a different color entirely from the color of the phone.ALSO, as you can see from the pictures it is also like DIRTY? There is some weird white substance in the grooves/seems on all four sides of the ENTIRE phone. The white substance was neither in the amazon box, the box the phone came in, nor in the sleeve that the phone was placed in so that means it was packaged with whatever the white stuff is and sent.To top it off, the battery capacity is only 84% PERCENT. This is not in ""excellent condition.""Pretty disappointed because other customers seemed to have a pretty good experience. Going to have to return which annoys me because I rarely do returns as well and try to avoid it. :("
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our iPhone 11 Pro Max we received was virtually flawless. The screen had no scratches, but the battery did require more charging. Nonetheless, the transferring of data/files was easy, as we took both phones to an AT&T store. All was done in less than 30 minutes. The part that took the longest was adding the Apple Watch to the new phone. The whole process took another 40 minutes. Overall, the entire experience was very positive. This is our 3rd phone purchase from the Renewed at Amazon, and have not had a bad experience thus far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone shipped exactly like the description. Works perfectly and just what I wanted."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","After looking at my options this phone and Amazon’s warranty seemed like my best option. It is like new and a breeze to set up. My only complaint was it came with a vinyl screen protector that was poorly installed. It was peeling off when I got it do just removed it. Replaced my failing 8+ and is a nice upgrade!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS AMAZED HOW NEW THIS PHONE LOOKED NOT ONE SCRATCH I WILL SAY THERE IS 1 tiny tiny chip of paint missing by the camera lens but it’s super tiny it’s more lik a dot not noticeable at all other than that not one mark I transferred my service over with no problem everything works no glitches or problems AT ALL AND AT FIRST I BOUGHT THIS SAME IPHONE FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER ON HERE FOR ALMOST $200 MORE AND WAS SENT A SUPER SMALL IPHONE SO I SENT IT BCK AND FOUND THIS ONE SO IM GLAD I HAD THAT HAPPEN CUZ THIS ONE WORKS AMAZING AND I PAID $200 LESS AND IVE SEARCHED ON HERE THIS IS THE CHEAPEST IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ON AMAZON SO IF UR LOOKING FOR THIS IPHONE UNLOCKED THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY AND 1 MORE THING I HAVE METRO BY T-MOBILE AND IT HOOKED UP WITH NO PROBLEMS"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was totally amazed by this phone. it came with 98% battery health and the phone was spotless. Besides the box and the refurbish notes that come with it, you would think this phone was brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","From the point I placed my order, the seller was straight forward with the order. I originally ordered a silver 11 pro max and that color was out of stock so the seller worked with me getting me a space grey model instead! Within hours, the order had been shipped out and I got it 2 days later. Extremely well packaged, the phone was on and ready to go with a full battery. Inserted my SIM card (for Verizon) and there were no issues, started right up on my network, no issues with the ESN (clean, not blacklisted). I’ve had it for roughly a week and a half and it works great! No issues, looks brand new, came with a third party charger and cable (not apple certified cube) and a sim port pin. I’d highly recommend this seller and would gladly order again!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","only thing I didn't like was the length it took to get here. but love the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was nervous to buy after seeing so many bad reviews , but the phone is great! Its in Excellent condition. I had a hard time finding any scuffs or marks i dont think i have any. Everything is as promised i just wish my battery health was higher than 82% otherwise it wouldve been a 5 star rating"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is great just it’s legit and is the exact thing that you pay for I was spectacle at first but once it arrived I was excited that I got what I expected I do suggest reading the description first because a lot of people made me get mixed emotions about buying this phone online. But overall it all worked out in the end and I’m happy so I definitely recommend buying."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","🧐🧐🧐"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered the phone in the morning and it showed up at my house at 6pm! I was so surprised and happy.

I was kind of concerned with the reviews but the phone was such a good deal that I went for it anyway. It does have some very small scratches in the top right corner of the display like maybe some keys rubbed on it at some point in a bag - but when the screen is on you can’t see them at all. It doesn’t change the fact that this was a wonderful deal and the rest of the phone looks completely new. My battery is at 97% and has lasted for hours and hours. No issues there.

I guess my suggestion is that if you’re going to be nit picky about scratches or dents, don’t buy a used phone. I’m extremely happy for what I paid."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was the renewed and not the renewed premium so I figured there may be superficial damage but I did not realize there would be a decent handful of micro scratches directly to the screen. I opened the box and was immediately disappointed. It looked like something I could have bought from a random guy in a mall food court rather than a refurbished phone. The scratches were not huge or deep but where very visible when the light hit them even at an arms length to everyone that looked at it. Requested the return a few minutes after opening the box and shipped it back the very next morning. I did get a quick refund with no real hassle but would have rather had a phone with a decent screen. I then ordered the renewed premium. The last two photos are what I ended up receiving where someone had put on a tape type protector that left a disgusting layer of thick sticky residue completely covering the touch screen. After about a solid two hours of cleaning and I finally had a clean phone but for being renewed premium that’s a bit ridiculous. No scratches obvious on the screen of the second phone and generally happy with the performance but the arrival appearance probably would have made me ship it back again if I was not stubborn to the core. It’s like Amazon wanted me to return both and go to Apple and to buy a brand new phone (which was the next step if I couldn’t get the screen clean on the second one)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se entregó en muy buenas condiciones, con muy leves señales de uso. Lo único en contra es que al parecer la pantalla que le cambiaron no es original, ya que en las configuraciones del dispositivo me lanza una alerta diciéndome que la pantalla no es original o no está bien instalada, por lo demás el dispositivo fue entregado como se anuncia."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came earlier than expected, I was excited to get it, didn't want to go out of town without a phone, so when it arrived early, I was happy...until I took the phone to my carrier to put a new sim card in it, that's when the sim card was rejected because the phone was not unlock or fully unlocked.

Also, the iPhone did not look like the iPhone 11 Pro Max I bought, it looks smaller and not the size of the actual phone in the picture, the was nothing in the unmarked box the phone was in to even indicate that it was actually an iPhone 11 Pro Max they sent me.

Am very disappointed, cause now I still don't have a phone...but I also have to go out of town without a phone, I tried to request a quick replacement since am travelling in one day, but they refuse and stated that I have to return the phone, then they will give me a refund but not another phone...SMFH!! So, I got the phone today and return it today. Now am waiting for my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic quality phone out of the box. Thanks seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I knew I was getting a renewed phone and couldn't expect a perfect phone but when it got here I noticed various scratches on the glass front screen and was wondering whether to return it or not. Fortunately nothing else was wrong with the phone, the camera lens was clean, the phone wasn't locked, the battery health was at around 95%. I decided to look for a glass screen protector and that solved the scratched screen as the new protector makes the scratches underneath not too noticeable. There have been no other problems since then and I am pleased with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funciona perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn’t come in the apple box and no apple sticker but the phone came crispy and it only has one thing wrong with it but it’s cool"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono estaba desbloqueado, batería 90%. Muy bueno."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s a pretty good phone. Great quality when it comes to aesthetics. Battery is great too. However I have been facing a couple of problems recently. One problem is that it tends to get hot when browsing the web. The other problem is network connectivity. The Wi-Fi and the cellular data randomly cuts out for a random period of time. Hopeful the last one was just some fluke because I haven’t experienced it again after the first few times."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything has worked well so far on this I-Phone (after downloading my info from I-cloud) ... except ...! A warning that the phone itself is displaying (I have attached an image) saying that it's unable to determine if the display is a genuine Apple part... ! I am afraid this will give me problems later on ...!Is anybody else having this problem?? Can anybody from this company give me customer support?"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered a renewed premium iPhone. Which I inspected in excellent condition as described but, the iPhone had many scratches around the edges.
Phone is being returned"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I loveddddd this product!
The price was great and I only found a few scratches on the bottom of the phone. They’re barely noticeable and can be covered by any case. Even with this, the phone was in almost brand new condition with 80% battery charge and a super clear screen! Super happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is good, has great battery life and It arrived very fast. The only thing is that it has a few signs of wear. It’s not a big deal though."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my review of the 512GB iPhone 11 Pro Max from Buyspry. I got this phone exactly 3 days ago.Your mileage may vary since these are refurbished phones however I did do some digging on this company and the seller had a great eBay reputation and no dings on BBB so I decided for this price and the Amazon backed 90 day money back, I had nothing to lose. I personally didn’t care if this phone came with a few scratches and nicks to the body, it would be going in a case anyway. The phone however arrived in a nice little box and procreated very well. The presentation was very decent. The phone was in immaculate condition and I couldn’t really find anything wrong aesthetically. The shipping did take a week but I’ll chalk that up to amazons storehouse and the recent icy weather. During my 3 days of use I have noticed no abnormalities and everything functions great. If there is a downside it’s the battery life. It’s at 90%. Obviously I would want it to be at 100% but at this price I’ll gladly take it. If you look at amazons refurbishing details it also lets you know that the battery’s are only guranteed to be over 80% life, so that is something to note, however battery’s aren’t too expensive and since this is an upgrade over my iPhone X even at 10% less battery life it still lasts several hours more easily. Overall I’m extremely pleased with my purchase and am so glad I got this for this price. Hope someone finds this info useful"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cracks on front, speaker doesn’t work right constantly hangs up and no one can hear you on it. I was surprised to see it didn’t work as expected I was hoping it would"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect shape. The best experience buying refurbished phones, especially iPhones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve had this phone for over 6 months. There’s never been a problem with the phone. The only thing is that the iCloud storage is not sufficient and you will most likely have to pay for GB every month. It recognizes my face even in the dark. The battery lasts longer than a day if I’m not on it streaming. It charges really quickly. My phone hasn’t overheated at all. Although when it’s charging I don’t get on my phone. If connecting aux cord, you need adapter cause box doesn't come with one. Camera quality is good especially if you’re switching from android."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Woudl buy again. Love making payments."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’d recommend buying an Amazon Renewed phone and will buy one again in the future. It’s like a new phone! It’s much faster than my iPhone 8 Plus. I just won’t spend $1,099 on the newest phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max) from Apple and this is a great option to upgrade to a “new” phone! Plus, I bought the two year insurance on it in case something happens."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my iPhone 11 p r o max I was worried about buying a reconditioned iPhone like new well it is like new I bought it sold and shipped from Amazon very happy with it ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery wasn’t replaced in service mode excellent cosmetic,but old battery"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good aspect, signs of usage and 87% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was somewhat nervous about buying a used iPhone, but could not justify the price of a new one. The 11 is the last major upgrade -- new chip, pro max, etc. Improvements to the later models are only incremental. So it was the perfect choice for me. I bought mine from Amazon because -- Amazon. And I opted for the renewed premium model. Mine came without a scratch anywhere and 90% on the battery. I am a happy camper."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my (like) new iPhone. I did a lot of research looking for the best deal and this was a pretty good. I’ve had this phone for a few months now and haven’t had any problems. The battery life is great! I recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone thinking it is a dual sim card as I had read to have a special sim card tray to hold two sim cards but what I got is BOT a dual dim mobile!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in excellent condition. Would not recognize that it is renewed. No scratches. Nothing. Worth the dollars."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular funciona regularmente bien, el sensor de proximidad no estaba funcionando bien pero no era mayor problema…. La batería estaba consumida pero definitivamente creo es la mejor batería que hecho iPhone dura todoooo el día, no recomiendo celulares usados por ese precio deberían costar menos ya que siempre viene con problemas los cuales result caro solucionarlos al menos en Ecuador"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far this one is a very good phone. Everything looks good. It updated with no problem, battery health is ok 80% not to bad wont be long and I'll need a new battery. That is one o the down falls in buying a ""renewed"" phone. All and all not a bad deal, the seller is other problem!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone arrived quickly and it is as described. It looks to be in excellent condition other than the battery life. 🙂"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was really excited about receiving this phone as it’s my first upgrade in 6 years. Everything from the condition of the phone to installation was great, until I checked the battery’s health and found out that it wasn’t a genuine Apple battery installed. On top of that, the phone became extremely hot as I was charging it. I’m giving this 2 stars because at least the phone arrived in pristine condition, which makes this even more disappointing. Minus 3 stars because of the aftermarket battery that was installed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone came earlier than I expected and with excellent working condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo el telefono esta exelente desbloqueado y trabaja bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Coming from an 11, my daughter wanted an upgrade and I convinced her to go for this 11 pro max and opt. for the higher storage (256gb). It was worth paying for the expedited shipping, the phone arrived in immaculate condition the battery health was EXCELLENT. Overall between the upgrade and almost new condition of the phone my daughter couldn’t be happier. She wanted the 13 pro max but at 1.5k at the time, this was a happy medium half the price and 256gb, lovely large screen. Overall EXCELLENT."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this as a gift for my best friend. Her old phone was having major issues, and I was growing frustrated trying to converse with her. She lives in Hawaii, and I live in Oregon, so it is essential that we have a reliable means of communicating. Being an Android user, I had to do a bit of research. This was far and away the better reviewed of the Apple products. When she got the phone (and, according to her, the shock of her life), she was thrilled. The phone has been amazing for her on so many levels. Not only are our conversations FAR less problematic, but she has found the phone's features indispensable for her work during this Covid-19 situation. As a speech pathologist working for the school system, she is having to do much of her client work online. She said the new phone has saved her tons of time and effort lugging a laptop around. Also, she is enthralled with the functionality related to standard private usage. I keep realizing that our phones today are basically more functional computer systems than the first computer I bought back in the mid-eighties. So, all-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase. Plus, my friend owes me for life. So, there's that, too. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update with 2nd purchase: 9/6/22These refurbished are more likely miss than hit. The second time around, the battery capacity is even lower, at 83%. The battery lost 1-2% while I was browsing the settings. It's an indicator that this battery is done as it's already in its 500th power cycle. Since these 11s are 3 year old now, I think it will be very hard to get one with more than 90% battery capacity. Unless you go for the premium refurbished. However, if someone goes that route, why not buy straight from Apple? Regular Refurbished (not Premium) here need to be at least $250 lower than Apple in order to be justified buying here. Again, I think the regular 80% battery capacity guaranteed is junk to begin with.1st Purchase:80% guaranteed really mean nothing because when the battery reached 80% capacity, it already toasted. Mine came with 87%. I bough it to replace the 7 Plus I bought brand new almost 6 years ago. The 7 Plus still has 85%. This 11 Pro Max is only 2 year old and only has 87%. Not really an improvement in term of battery life. Plus, at some point last year, it was damaged and the screen(s) got replaced. Yes, it is still within the terms set by Amazon for renewed products. However, if you got something like I did, you would have to spent a bit more to get the battery replaced and hoping that nothing else is wrong with the phone down the line. A couple years ago and before the premium renewed line, Amazon renewed was more of a sure thing. Now, it is a luck of draw. You may get something that was gently used or heavily used like mine. $600 for a heavily used phone, not worth it. May be better to spent a little more and get it straight from Apple (12 Pro Max for $200 more, came with brand new battery and shell, plus 1 year warranty same as brand new)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone must’ve experienced water damage. Not loud. Can’t hear on the phone. Trying to get in contact with the seller to fix the issue… [88% battery life] Still waiting on my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bateria al 94% de vida útil, sin uno solo rasguño, parece nuevo, lo único que no me dejó por completo feliz es el cargador con el que viene, no es original ellos son claros en eso, pero es de muy mala calidad por el precio que se paga y por ser Premium deberían incluir un cargador de mejor calidad. Pero el teléfono específicamente está perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone ear speaker is super quiet. Everything else works fine. Have tried everything to remedy and still not loud enough to have a conversation. Not happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone says that the parts used to fix what I assume was a bad battery and a broken display screen are not genuine apple parts. It was a bit annoying for the first week or so because the notification wouldn’t clear and it seemed like every time I unlocked it it would take me to settings. Now it’s okay I just can’t see the battery health. I haven’t looked into how much it is going to be to fix this issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular llegó en buen estado físico, pero creo con algunos defectos mínimos como el altavoz"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was definitely a good purchase I 10/10 recommended was kind of Effie about it because it’s from Amazon but the battery life is awesome came charged and in very good condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It would’ve been a five star review but I got sent a broken charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect for the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not complaining because I appreciate the phone being available at a decent price. However, I’m a little annoyed that the battery health is at 85%. I should have done a little more research before I made my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition pf the phone is great no deep scratches on the screen only small ones from light use battery came at 95% capacity 4 stars mainly because the charger and block that came with it are on the cheaper end but overall no complaints"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I live in Texas and this phone was in NY when we purchased it. It arrived to us the day after we purchased it. I was amazed at how fast this phone made it to my house! Thank you! The phone itself is in great condition but there’s ton’s of scratches on the front glass, so I’ll be replacing the front glass but other than that, I’m very pleased with this purchase! I was so nervous to by refurnished, but we will definitely go this route again. My phone stays charged at 100 percent, and everything was as the Seller said it would be. Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bout this phone from last year July and since then I’ve had no problems, it’s just like buying a new phone without the same cost"

 * The packaging came in standard Amazon and not premium
* They told me it would come with the original packaging and it did not.
* The device came with an inner package with a socket that contains the device that is torn in the corners.
* There is a pretty significant internal scratch in the shape of a circle, on the inner screen probably slightly below the battery life up on the left side of the screen.
* The ""silver"" color of the device is slightly yellowish.
* On the packaging it is explicitly written ""Renewed"" and not ""Renewed"" Premium.
* The cover of the device inside the box came unclean and with hairs between the device and the cover, even the cover itself would not wrap the device properly and even carelessly so that the device was partially exposed.
* Battery life 91%

If you order international it is a serious problem because if you start returning a shipment by international shipment it is complicated and expensive, And the shipment to me was slow & expensive as well and the risk is very great.

After a purchasing I spoken with a service provider in chat & I asked that everything will be checked before shipment and that there will be no problems at all (Because I am not interested in returning the shipment back or getting a refund).
i was assured that there would be no problems, unfortunately it really was not so.

I thought I could trust them and also paid more for the premium so that there would be no problems and unfortunately now there is nothing left to do and even if there is an option to return the item then that is exactly what I was not interested in in the first place and also not willing to mess with it anymore."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’m actually pretty shocked that for a refurbished phone that the quality is so good. Looks brand new besides a few very minor scratches. Giving 4 stars only because one of the speakers on the bottom don’t work but it’s not really the end of the world. All in all a pretty decent phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm loving the phone. Takes amazing photos. With 256GB storage I can store all my videos and photos without worrying about space! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone with no issues. The only way I can even tell it’s been used is a very slight, about 1cm short scratch on the back. Battery life is excellent, camera is excellent, speakers and sound quality are great, it’s basically a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Well I have to say that I was worried about ordering a “renewed” phone from Amazon. A third party seller nonetheless, I am extremely surprised at the amazing condition the phone came in. It showed up on time, packaged very well, No damage, charger and original box included, which I wasn’t expecting. The phone is working flawlessly so
Far. I literally can’t think of anything to complain about. For Amazon shoppers that might as well be a miracle. O-M Wireless really went above and beyond my expectations. It came with a 91% capacity battery, It was sent with a very thick and durable screen protector. (Would recommend buying a thinner one for every day use) sent second day air, they had the color and carrier I wanted and it was a better price than I could find any where else. Not a single noticeable scratch or defect than can been seen with just my eyes. Pairs flawlessly, camera is good, set up with my carrier by simply switching SIM cards from my old phone to new one. Was done in 10 minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I trusted Amazon as that is whom I purchased this iPhone from. It came with a warranty and the support that was needed was great! I am glad I made the choice to buy this way."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Jealous the price is lower now after spending 667 on this phone but I really needed an upgrade and love this phone so much. Has no dings, scratches, NOTHING!!!! Only thing is I had this phone for a week and already twice this phone will restart over and over again by itself sometimes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s what it says it is but I honestly thought for the price it would be better. The FaceID doesn’t work. I even updated to the latest os, which apple said should’ve solved the issue, it didn’t. There are deep scratches in the surface which they hid rather well at first glance with this heavy, bulky screen protector that was also warped. Some minor scratches and dings on the sides/corners. That’s to be expected with a “renewed” iPhone. Everything else works fine. The charging seems ok even though it was NOT at 80% when it arrived. It was at 30%. To summarize… it’s a roulette & It’s better than my shattered 8 plus."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone seemed like it came straight from apple and was new I choice normal Renee’s and got what seems like a premium renewed phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despite seeing so nasty reviews I decided why not I bought it with very low expectations upon receiving the device it was in surprisingly good condition only imperfection was a small hairline on the screen but its hardly visible storage is as requested and battery health is 91% phone has been working well since only one time the phone shut of unexpectedly but hasn’t done it since overall im satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in excellent condition. I’m so glad I went with the renewed premium and not regular renewed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone 11 Pro Max arrived one day early. Excellent condition. Set up was a breeze. Would definitely buy from again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased an Renew Premium iPhone 11 Pro Max 256gb, and unfortunately it did not come with the promised 90% battery capacity. I contacted customer service and they made everything right. They gave me two options, one to return the device, and the other to be partially refunded since the device did not meet the requirements for being premium renewed. I kept the device and accepted the refund, and I’m glad I did. Everything else about the phone is amazing, and I’m very happy with it! Awesome customer service! This is the 3rd device I’ve ordered, and I would recommend this option to anyone looking to save some money while still getting a great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve bought 3 of the midnight green versions and have not been disappointed, especially for the price, i must recommend. If you’re having services issues just go to your carrier and they will get it straight. I had to take all 3 to my provider, even though they are unlocked, very quick and easy. You won’t find a better deal than this, and i can confirm they work on overseas carriers once you pop that SIM card in. Pull the trigger on this while you can!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really love the phone. No scratches and cracks. Face recognition 10/10. Battery life, not really what I expected (84%) but overall, one of my best cellphone purchases on Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything seems to be great. The only issue was it wasn't very clean. The upper speaker was filthy. But after a little cleaning all and all just like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was full of problems and a terrible disappointment initially. I debated returning it, then performed a factory reset and now have a wonderful phone at a greatly reduced price. Since this phone is used extensively in every way possible, I’m extremely grateful for such a good produce! Others even use my phone to take important pictures because the quality is so enhanced. The battery life is very good giving me at least 21 hours of use before needing a charge. Face recognition, the ability to swish type, and the speed of flipping through apps all contribute toward saving valuable time. In all, this was an excellent purchase at a much more reasonable price than what I’d have paid for the same phone brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect, no scratches or anything. Just what I wanted!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No comment working great my sister love it 😍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would of been very happy with this purchase if the camera worked. You could hear and feel the camera / microphone / vibration all tweaking. Battery was at 85% which is decent for a refurbished I phone and scree and case were in get shape."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone is the best iPhone that I ever owned, I love the Face ID it’s very fast and battery life is awesome since that this is my first ever iPhone that I bought from Amazon and it’s fantastic. I bought the renewed premium that says 90% or higher mine came with 99% battery heath and no scratches on the screen the is like brand new out of the box I would definitely recommend buying a iPhone on Amazon well worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s always a skeptical decision to buy refurbished anything but this was an amazing product and I could not find a single fault with the cosmetics of the phone.
When I got the phone I had to factory reset it as it was not done. Upon turning the phone on I didn’t even have to go through the setup mode and someone else’s iCloud was attached to the phone. That was worrisome at first but a simple factory reset solved that problem.

I would recommend this phone.
Be sure to ship it to the right address because the shipper will not change anything once the package is shipped. They put restrictions on the package where nothing could be changed and honestly if it weren’t for the FedEx delivered I would’ve had to wait for it to return to the shipper and get a refund. The FedEx driver realized I had moved and left the package at my new address."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall Phone works well, no 5g like my Samsung A71, Wi-Fi doesn’t maintain strong connection like my A71 at same distance from router.

Cosmetics of the phone- arrived with a screen protector pre-installed, when I removed it I found a deep scratch and permanent scuff on the glass. Back of phone shows wear from previous owners case especially around cameras and the camera rings have some scratches and a couple deep grooved nicks. Overall not exactly “like new” as promised by Amazon renew physical description…probably will return"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came with a noticeable scratch on the screen but everything else is fine its still beautiful but I probably would recommend getting renewed premium 😬"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","this phone is open to all carriers which was wonderful. Fully unlocked and easy to set up! I was afraid to order at first but I'm glad I did. Oh and its a real apple phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect renewed phone came with no stratches or scuffs functions properly and came with a good charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have been using it for about 1 month now and the phone looks and works like a brand new phone. However, i do have this small issue where at random times the wifi doesnt work. Its not a huge issue because its very rear ( maybe once a week) and it only goes down for a few seconds. I have tried on other wifi access points all over the city and my neighborhood and i have experienced this on some of them as well so i know its not my wifi. I have my other phone with me and it never goes down.
But other than that, i am happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got this phone it would not turn it’ll turn back on every second and make phone hot I had to figure it how to turn it off and the battery life it’s not good but it’s also not bad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It have a small chip but it was really hard to spot in normal conditions and everything else was working perfectly. It was overall a great deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got this phone when my old one crapped out. It is only a couple of generations old and the price is excellent. The phone is like brand new. The battery life is excellent. Face ID works great. Great screen! All in all it is a great phone! I have no regrets whatsoever about buying it! I love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno, Justo por el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelent condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is a very beautiful iPhone. It looks brand new. Doesn’t have a single scratch. Came with a charging brick and cord. Fully unlocked. Downloaded information from my other phone perfectly.
UPDATE: had to update. I still LOVE this phone. It’s beautiful and sleek and works perfect. The battery is strong. It never overheats. It never glitches. There was not one single scratch on it when I received it. It feels so beautiful in the hands. The thickness is beautiful and solid. It’s so much larger than the iPhone 11. It’s identically as beautiful as the new iPhone 12. This was a good purchase. I’m very happy with it. I was initially apprehensive about investing in an iPhone through amazon. It’s my first Amazon Phone purchase. I’m glad I took the leap. NEW UPDATE: STILL IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE. IT STILL WORKS PERFECT. NEVER GLITCHES OR OVERHEATS. IT’S STILL SO BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. GREAT LEAP OF FAITH. I FEEL LIKE I GOT A BRAND NEW PHONE."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It so much thing wrong with this phone I HATE IT LIKE WHY????? Never ordering a phone off Amazon again ! 💔💔💔💔💔"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I went from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and I am absolutely in love with this phone. The camera is awesome and takes great pictures. Face recognition works great; it recognizes my face with my sunglasses on. The battery lasts longer than the iPhone 7 Plus."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno sin problemas como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max offers rock solid WiFi performance and reliable cell service in weak signal areas, unlike the reconditioned iPhone XS Max that it replaced. After my other seller's tech support staff exhausted all possible solutions for the older phone's performance issues, I decided to return that phone and upgrade to the 11 Pro Max.

Not certain whether my previous phone's problems had been caused by the XS Max itself or by some combination of the apps I had installed, I took a chance and set my new phone up from a back up of the previous phone. The difference was immediately obvious; in an area where the XS Max showed one bar of signal strength on a good day and no signal most of the time, I now have two and sometimes three bars with no dropped calls. WiFi reliability has shown a similar degree of improvement.

Returning the XS Max and spending the extra money for this iPhone 11 Pro Max has been one of the best decisions I've made. Even better yet, this reconditioned 11 Pro Max looks like a brand new phone, with no visible scratches, and retains 100% of its battery capacity.

In short, I'm a very happy customer!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I even opened the box, it was making noise like something was playing.. it was on an auto voice thing where it would read everything on the screen.. after I get it all set up and everything it is perfect. Almost no signs of wear.. screen protector on it is perfect. Battery life is good and there is nothing wrong with it. I am glad I took the chance to buy this and it even came two days early. Very happy with this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La batería es mala, dura muy poco, por lo demás todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When they sell on Amazon renew products they should look into it closely, so I purchased this iPhone from a seller named BUYSPRY and the phone did look good it didn't have scratches or blemishes on the edges or on the back of the phone but there was a tempered glass covering the front screen when I remove the temper glass there were light blemishes and fine hairline scratches on the screen surface it's not noticeable when you put on the tempered glass which I do on my phone to protect it from scratches but when you remove it it is noticeable so the product isn't really renew when there are scratches on the phone screen I would give it a b+. I think Amazon and their resellers need to evaluate and understand when using the term renewed and refurbished because this phone wasn't renewed it felt more like refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone in good condition and everything is working fine, but the price is too much, and when I returned it to Amazon they won't give me my money back until they receive the phone and I sent it 8 day's ago for $14 with ups but still delay, I'm in need for the money but I'm stuck with this stupid return policy Amazon have, iphone 11 pro max 512g for $847 sum change while u can get it for 600 sum change!!?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this phone was a good buy. It did have a one inch scratch at the top of the screen and battery capacity was at 94%. In my opinion all “renewed” phones should come with a new battery. How can it be “renewed” if nothing has been done to it. This phone was basically half price so I am completely satisfied. I would definitely purchase again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","very god, but the screen like a little bad, touchscreen, but its god"

Loving my new phone! I've had it close to a month now and so far so good. I was a little skeptical about ordering after reading the few negative comments concerning issues activating phone with Sprint, however, those comments are prior to T-Mobile merge. I experienced no issues whatsoever activating phone. I upgraded from 6S Plus, so just had to get use to some feature changes (i.e. taking screenshots). Overall, excellent buy!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is perfect 🥰"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","A lot of money for a use cell
I was hoping the battery would’ve lasted a lot longer and I’m still charging it halfway through the day so I’m very dissatisfied with that also looking forward to this new camera gonna be so much better I have not noticed a difference from the iPhone X"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mine had scratches on it and battery wouldn’t last long then I found out that I couldn’t talk on the speaker phone for calls. People would complain that they couldn’t hear me. Only way it worked was if I had it against my ear. Then the face recondition took a while. It says that it should come in a almost new condition but with problems like that and the money I spend it shouldn’t be like that"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Iphone like brand new. Battery 95%, no scratches or damage's. Charger not original but new and works well. The only sad thing is the key to remove sim card wasn’t came in the box. But i recomend buy Renewed Premium. It worth the money spent."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it it’s everything I wanted I’m super happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery health is inferior to a normal iPhone 11 Pro Max. This phone 1-2 hours to charge, and has a very low active usage life (4-5 hours screen time). This phone’s unauthentic apple battery is subpar at best."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is like a brand new phone. No scratches or defects at all. I genuinely appreciate the way they boxed it up. It was like opening a new phone. Battery life is phenomenal. Really guys you would never know this was refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","tuve dudas al comprarlo pero, una lo tuve en mis manos y lo utilice me di cuenta que estaba en perfecto estado.
full recomendado y agradecido con el vendedor por tener buena calidad en sus productos.
resaltar que el paquete solo demoro 5 días en llegar USA a Panamá."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","In great condition when I got it and still is"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","As if I bought it brand new, Great purchase☺️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works and easy to get connected to my own service. No problems at all with my phone and I have never had a problem buying phones on Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","However the add stated it would be above 80% they should replace the battery if it’s in the lower 80s just because these are supposed to be renewed not used heavily"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I prefer my iPhone 6. When I do a search using iPhone 11 Pro Max the results return in small print, many times query doesn’t return results at all. I am glad I kept my iPhone 6 so that I can use it for back up to search and read pages the iPhone 11 Pro Max doesn’t seem to respond to. Same search but either wrong results or no response. Also, some pages are blocked so I have to use my iPhone 6 to get results. Setting seem ok but for some reason the iPhone 11 Pro Max performs below par."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received my refurbished iPhone 11 Pro Max and the phone came flawless.. I was nervous about buying a refurbished phone off Amazon but definitely met my expectations and more.. it looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was a bit nervous at first buying this but the phone quality is absolutely amazing….. came with 100% battery …. No scratches and everything was to my liking"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cosmetically it is a 7/10, came in VERY dirty, dirt in the camera and port, after cleaning looks ok, everything works fine BUT the speakers are blown out, everything sounds so bad, and due to work i cant afford to not have a phone for a week so i’ll just buy the bullet on this but do beware."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I personally was really scared spending this much money on the phone especially after purchasing it and going on here to read comments. Stressed me out for a few days waiting for the phone because a lot of negative reviews but so far so so good. I have had the phone for 2 months now and works perfectly fine do not let the comments fool you i will recommend this to anyone to get if needing a phone the vendor is fine and delivery was smooth got here quick and battery life is perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant at first about buying this iPhone but I am so glad I did ! It’s perfect ;) it came way sooner than expected & it was well packaged! The iPhone is in perfect condition, no scratches & it also had a screen protector on it ! I highly recommend buying it , you won’t be disappointed!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Price point was amazing & just what I was looking for. Phone came in like new condition & was not only at 75% battery but also had a screen protector already installed for me. Came on time with a charger & plug & works amazingly. Would definitely look to this seller for my next purchase of a renewed phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy a renewed phone due to some reviews here, but I decided to give it a try and I’m happy I did.

The phone is in good condition, no cosmetic damage and battery is just as described: 85%, so it lasts on me a day with low usage (two if I’m at home), but I need to charge it during the day if I’m using extensively. Overall I’m really happy for this."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","bad battery"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The delivery was very quick. It looks great and so far works very well. I would order from this supplier any time and recommend him. Many thanks..
I. Marlow"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect condition no scratches 100% battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone didn’t even seem refurbished seems brand new heck I’m even using it while typing this lol there were no scratches on screen, battery health was at 100 even after it recalibrated from more usage, and it came within a timely matter I think a day early if I’m not mistaken"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is in very good condition in the outside but only have 80% of Health on batery and when I’m on pictures on a call or video call it goes like if is dead for am1 minute and hang out the FaceTime calls plenty of time I’m gonna wait 3 more days if this keep happening I’m gonna return it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered 2 phones one for me and one for my son. Neither one of us have had any problems. Phones showed up in perfect shape and we had no problems activating them. We are with straight talk. Would definitely order from this seller again Came with phone , charger and, sd card remover"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is decent for 615 when I got it on sale. Now it went back up to 663. Description says no defects when viewed at arms length. Yeah, if you're Helen Keller. It's a few scratches and at various areas on the screen. However it is superficial and isn't deep grooves and hides well under a screen protector. But the screen protector provided is cheap, the sides doesn't stick as you can see in the pic. I don't want to return it, risk getting another scratched up one for the higher price. Plus the back and camera is pristine, guess the previous owner kept it in a case. Also the battery is at 97% health so for 615 plus 5 bucks for a case and screen protector to hide the superficial srcratches...it's a decent buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Yo lo compré para cambiar de teléfonos y para tener uno mejor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","1st experience with an Amazon renewed product. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Looks and functions as brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó completo y muy nítido. Volvería a comprar a BuySpry.. compre en otra tienda y no llego completo.. BuySpry lo mejor.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall good physical condition. Some dirt build up at speakers and earpiece. I was expecting battery to be new or better than 80% of the original capacity. Came with screen protector, not sure if it is to hide scratches on actual screen or just as an extra. Have not taken it out yet."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Why does it say Verizon as my carrier? I though this phone was unlocked?!?!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ok good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono estéticamente está bien solo unos rasguños en la pantalla, el cargador no funcionó por eso es que le doy baja calificación pienso que por el precio pudo haber estado mejor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought this iPhone 11 Pro Max to replace my broken iPhone XS Max. Received the phone in 2 days and was pleased upon opening the package to find the phone in mind condition! Battery was at 82% which was not so great, but was willing to overlook it as the phone was in excellent condition with not a single scratch or dent. However, when I went to my phone carrier to set up my new phone, I was told they could not activate it! Apparently the phone was not a clean IEM and could not be activated. My carrier even made several phone calls but to no avail! Phone could not be activated and basically was a dead paper weight!
I was very unhappy because of my wasted time and money! Then it I had to sent it back to Amazon for a refund and it took over 2 weeks to get my money refunded! Do not waste your time and effort on a Amazon renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max. I should have listened to the many bad reviews for this phone but I was willing to take a chance and unfortunately got a bad deal!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todas las funciones tal cual un equipo nuevo, la batería llegó con un 86% teniendo en b cuenta el tipo de equipo estás comprando aún le queda una vida útil de años !!! No me arrepiento de esta compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice picture"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came good just that it had scratches on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery life is why it love it.
Also all the updated items.
Great phone!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Working perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Didn’t like some part of my camera front camera photos came out distorted like it wasn’t 12megapixel in front, had to compare with other peoples phones to know mine had some issue apart from that everything was okay"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","i got the iphone 11 pro max in gold and it is in very good condition. works really well. everything is fine just has a few minor scratches on the screen which is bearable but would receive a 5/5 if they weren’t there. i also ordered the iphone 11 pro in gold with the same feature (256 gb) and it had no scratches at all. so compared to this phone, the physical condition is better on the 11 pro. other than the small minor scratches, everything works well as if i just bought it at an apple store!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It works as expected, arrived timely. NowI purchased a cover for it, added a finger holder, so it’s perfect

Use it every day for a phone, texting, social media, brain games and learning."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","my first time buying an iPhone from Amazon, at first I felt a little skeptical because what if the phone comes out to be scratchy/ battery condition is bad and etc. but when I got the packaged phone works well, the battery health was at 93% which was fine for me because the description said it will be 80% and above. It came with a charger as well, I've been reading about these reviews here saying the charger is not the original one from apple, hello read caption/ product first before buying. they gave me everything that they stated in the bio. PHONE WORKS WELL AND WORKS AS BRAND NEW FROM APPLE STORE!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS PRICE ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS 256GB.. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. :)) THANK YOU!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve only had it for 3 days so this review might be a little premature, but so far so good. My review is only about the phone itself because the packaging is not the original and the charger is aftermarket, but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was really good for this phone. Face recognition and the actual appearance of the phone are 5 stars, no dents or scratches absolutely nowhere on the screen or bezel, I am using ultra mobile so I went for the Tmobile phone since they’re the same network and it worked just fine as soon as I introduced the sim card, no icloud issues whatsoever which has happened before on other iphones from other sellers. I’m gonna give you guys 4.5 stars just for the mere reason of the packaging and the charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great product that came as described. Only minor issues: battery life is 87% and there is a small scratch on the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó bien se ve algo bien ya se ve su uso excesivo con batería en un 89% creo ya muy usado para que valga más de 700$ pero funciona perfecto hoy lo active a la línea todo bien lo malo que no haga realidad la cuenta de la Apple store intente hacer una nueva con mi otro correo electrónico de igual forma no agarra el código de seguridad.. Si no puedo hacer la cuenta de la tienda de Apple tendré que regresarlo y espero que a si como toman el dinero a si sea de vuelto a mi cuenta Gracias 😡"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Product was a gift. Recipient is happy with gift"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works great, face recognition works wonderfully, battery life lasts me all day sometimes have to charge it once during the day, storage capacity is perfect I have space for all my pictures and applications with tons of space leftover"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Incredible deal! Came with 100 percent battery life! This iPhone takes several holes to even drain down from 90% let alone when it’s still rocking on 1% all night! Got a 30 watt charger to go with it, it seems it draws between 18 and 22 watts? So the 30watts is extra headroom versus the 18watt max from Apple. This refurbished unit came with a third party charger and cables as expected. It is indeed the right color and storage capacity. Flawless, not a single scratch and a clean imei. The size is perfect, about the same, but a little wider than the Galaxy Note9 I upgraded from. Thank you BuySPRY for the perfect iPhone’s! My device shipped with 13.4.1 and didn’t force me to upgrade while setting up so I was able to cough cough run some stuff on it if you know what I mean ;)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I felt so ripped off but it’s is what it’s, I’m not the type of person to judge a product of some bad reviews but I should have stuck by it and not purchase the phone cause what is this, should have know better cause the phone came on 1% smh"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This product came with only three small scratches. The battery life was only at 85 percent, so not that great, but still a great product and delivery."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was packaged good and with care. I asked for a space grey 64gb, but gave me a 256gb midnight green.Which is way better. Came with a 90 percent battery which meets. Everything works it perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Shipping was exceptionally quick, I bought this phone for my dad’s birthday at the last minute and it arrived the night before. My dad upgraded from a 6 Plus to this phone and he loves it. Works just like a brand new phone and all of his information transferred over seamlessly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got the Amazon Premium refurb, but hopefully I won’t need to use it, and it may seem like I won’t need to"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The negative comments almost put me off but this phone is literally amazing so if you’re thinking of doing it please do it. Could be a hit or miss but you might hit so do it. Literally NO scratches or cracks. Nothing"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks and works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was pretty nervous to spend this much for a phone that was refurbished (technically) but I am so glad I did! It came in on time, all packed up nice and neat. It was charged and only had one little scratch on the top left camera frame (the silver ring around the actual lens, therefore doesn’t affect camera at all). Everything works great, speakers sound amazing, camera is the absolute best quality, and the battery can last me all day if I forgot to put it on charge the night before. It came in exactly as described and I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I also bought a glass screen protector and spiegen case for the best protection."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased this certified renewed iPhone 11 Pro Max 256GB to replace my old iPhone 7 because I didn't want to buy iPhone 12 Pro with 5G technology that is still developing yet. Received this phone with a few minor scratches around the rim and the scratch on the screen is not noticeable after putting screen protector. Battery capacity is 100%!! I have been testing a lot of functions (playing video game, watching YouTube video, FaceTime with families overseas, virtual office meeting via zoom and MS team, pairing with Apple Watch etc.), no freeze or any issues so far. The battery lost only 4% yesterday morning when pairing with Apple Watch (with bluetooth on) and joining virtual office meeting via zoom. It is amazing! OVERALL, IT IS A GREAT RENEWED PHONE with the price paid!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No ear volume great testing. Now it’s call apple we will send another if they ok it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The hook of Amazon Renewal was to buy a used product that looks and functions like new. At a lower price and save the planet at the same time. Nice marketing I fell for it. Twice! I bought a iPhone 11 ProMax from BuySpry. The first phone had a single deep scratch on the bottom left. It also had metal damage on the bottom left from it being dropped by previous owner. There were also numerous very visible scratches all over the screen. How very disappointing for a phone that was marketed as ‘renewed’ and called Grade A refurb. Okay. Chalk it up to lemon. I returned it. And ordered another. Bad omen. The second phone box was used. The seal was broken and clearly I just got someone’s return. WTH. The second one was slightly less bad but not acceptable. . It had a actual chip in the LCD screen along with several noticeable scratches. Wow. This was not renewed to like new and not grade A as pitched. I returned this one as well. The bad I already told you. The good. The first phone had 100% battery health so clearly it was replaced. Don’t know about the second phone. Seeing a chip in the lcd. I didn’t even bother to power it up. I returned it the same day in disappointment. Both phones had screen protectors. I think to hide the scratches more than as protection for the second user if I may be cynical. Perhaps I got two bad phones and I am the exception. Perhaps it’s the seller BuySpry. And other companies do a better job? I do not know but I don’t think I will be going to fall for Amazon used marketing for a long while."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","What I loved about this phone ultimately is that it came in as if I purchased it brand new. This phone had no problems with scratches, bumps, or any problems with lagging.

However, the one downside to this phone was the battery. The battery dies starts to drain within hours, and I need to charge it in the middle of the day. It just does not last long for the day.

But overall, great quality of the camera, lots of storage, and I enjoy it overall."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Screen was lifted on edges and would not respond to touch well. Had to tap several times to get it to work."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba algo preocupada x q no sabía en q condiciones llegaría el iPhone 11 Pro Max, pero me siento muy feliz, llego en perfecta condiciones física y de funcionamiento, ni un solo rasguño, aparte llego dos días antes de lo programado, realmente me siento muy satisfecha con el producto y la oportunidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hi, I am not the type of person that writes bad reviews, but I think it is important to do so in this case. I bought this iPhone and it was the most expensive one out of all the others, because supposedly it was in excellent conditions. Well the phone itself was in great condition. But the audio was horrible, for some reason the audio was messed up and you can barely hear videos or things like that playing. Don’t call something in excellent condition if not everything is in good condition, can’t have a phone for such an amount of money and having horrible problems when it comes to the audio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone was meant to be a Christmas present. First phone didn’t arrive, second was wrapped as a present. Receiver spent time loading the older phone backup just to realize the phone speaker wasn’t working. The sound was almost inaudible and very fainted (even when increasing the volume all the way up). Useless if you want to hear the phone ringing, or map directions in the car. I had to return it and order another one directly from Apple."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone a couple of months ago and it came with the screen protector and I was like that's cool. Recently, while replacing the screen guard I peel off the old one and saw that my phone screen is full of scratches and those are deep scratches and not just normal scratches. It's like somebody has must have been rigged the phone on concrete, but the smart a** seller has already put on a new screen guard to fool the customers like me. This is really a huge disappointment. It's been a more than 3 months now so I can't return it and these phones are expensive, so we are under the impression that it must be a nice product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall this is a good phone for the price they want buttt the phone did come with some scratches on it but i’m in IT tech and fixed it already but beware when ordering!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got what would seem to be a brand new phone. 11max pro. Full battery. Perfect all the way around. Sweet."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was is great condition but for some reason it will not pair with any car radio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Every thing perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente celular! Muy recomendable! No tiene daños ni rayas! Funciona todo correctamente y vino con 93% de batería! Excelente como nuevo!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I can count the amount of reviews that I’ve done. But this deserves the best review that I can post. First of all, the phone came a day early, that’s a plus up 100 for me, second, the phone came in perfect condition, no scratches, or dents whatsoever and that’s a plus 1,000. Third, the phone is compatible with my SIM card. If you’re reluctant about buying from this seller, I’ll tell you that you can trust them. And the price for the condition of the phone that I received is heaven sent. I’m very happy with my purchase and I’m not disappointed at ALL. Thank you very much ♥️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Kiss electronics NYC sent an iphone 11 pro max with a busted top speaker. Not satisfied at all. I see that they are permanently closed now so im assuming they have also sent bad products to plenty of others.👎👎"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers are messed up,otherwise good phone,I need someone to contact me on this"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a great deal"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this for my father and he loved it. No issues at all and it has very tiny cosmetic scratch on top right of the screen. The reason why I purchased for size and storage capacity and considering to get myself one too"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I upgraded from a Iphone 8 plus to the 11 pro max and I can't not stress enough how great this phone is the battery life is so great feels like you can use the phone all day and it won't die. The display is so awesome you can really tell the difference with the oled display on the 11 compared to the 8 plus all the dark blacks look amazing. The camera quality is out of this world with the three cameras it feels like you can record movie quality videos and take stunning pictures as well. 10/10 would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy it. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is fine, it's an iPhone 11 pro max as described. No noticeable defects. Curious why the refurb market is flooded with this model in this color?
DOES NOT WORK ON SPRINT AS IS CLEARLY CLAIMED IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE DESCRIPTION."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is great except I can only use the speaker phone to be able to hear the other person on the call."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo OK pero la batería tiene 83% es muy poco para que lo vendan al precio que no compre"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It came in a day early, was not scratched, and works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Capacity not right"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Condition is pristine. Works well and came with 100% battery life. Very satisfied customer."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life good, face recognition good, camera lenses did fall off 3 days after I got it, connected with metro they think it was a fake iPhone with different screen and camera and flash. Did not come in original box."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price phone quality is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had hella issues upon buying this phone. For one, the people who sell it are not certified to have Apple screens so I had MAJOR screen issues. My screen was even coming out by the second week of having the phone. I contacted them and they were willing to fix it but since they did not have Apple products. I decided not to send it back.. I would’ve sent it back but that would’ve cost me too much time. So I got it fixed at my job and now it works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s a B+ Rated phone but extremely clean! I’m impressed. Battery health is 92%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came in great condition, the screen nor cameras have any scratches visible, but there are minor scratches along the corners and such. The phone is fast and has given me no problems so far, but I will update if need be. I would recommend to buy it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I saw that it was a refurbished phone I was a little hesitant. I have bought refurbished items before but this one is really great. The battery has a 91 percent and the unit itself looks really brand new. No scratches, no broken screen or anything else. It was refurbished by Verizon so I guess they know what they are doing. If you are thinking about a refurbished item then I recommend that you go ahead and buy it. I did and it worked out GREAT!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I WAS SUPER SCARED OF BUYING MY IPHONE 11 PRO MAX ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS GOING OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR A WHILE, RIGHT AFTER BUYING IT AND JUST INCASE IT HAD AN ISSUE, I WOULD BE SCREWED. I WAS ALSO SCARED THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE TRULY UNLOCKED... HOW WRONG WAS I!!!
THE PHONE IS AMAZING!! TOTALLY UNLOCKED!! LOOKS AS GOOD AS NEW! NO SCRATCHES... NO MARKS! TOTALLY BRAND NEW! NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL... I MEAN, AT ALL!! BATTERY LEVELS... ALSO PERFECT!
WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE. CAN'T WAIT TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE FROM THEM."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fantastic phone despite it has a minor imperfection on the screen. But the phone itself is fully functional. I give 4.5 out of 5 to the seller due to seller not disclosing the imperfection on the screen.

This iphone 11's camera is by far worse than Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. The color is indeed not as good as Samsung. If you plan to take professional photos and videos, this iPhone is not a right choice. I am not advertising for any company, but as a professional studio, I give a fair judgement and honest opinion about Apple and Samsung."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! I was a bit skeptical to buy a phone online, but this Amazon refurbished iPhone is amazing. Not only is it in mint condition, but the battery life was still 96%!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the size and face recognition. I miss having the control button on the front and the battery life percentage shown, I don’t like that."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Cuando me llegó el teléfono hace un mes tenía un 96% en la condición de la batería , ahora tengo 92%, no sé si es normal que haya disminuido tanto en ese lapso de tiempo. Algo que he notado es que no me llegan las notificaciones siempre, a veces si, a veces no."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase 2 of these and weeks later was on sale for over $100.00 less. Have many dents and cracks. functions ok. have many scratches and sometimes the screen freezes, I wish I can return and purchase a different one. I will not recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llegó en perfecto estado, cumplió con las expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal and business"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my iPhone 11 Pro Max came in a generic box with generic charger but works and looks brand new! Very happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","love it! it’s in perfect condition for me, battery could be a little better but 95% battery health is better than less than that. I was able to set it up the same day and absolutely no issue. the condition is immaculate despite the small scuffs around the border of the device that cannot be visible with a case. everything so far is perfect- lets just hope that this one doesn’t break so fast :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","everything was perfect came with a new charger ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this seller. I have purchased 4 phones from this seller in the last two years for me and my children. The phones come brand new to be renewed. The battery is like new with 100% battery life and the phones are packaged like brand new. hey quality is as if you walked into the apple store and bought them. Worth every penny. They also operate as if they are brand new and work like butter. I love this seller. will remain a lifetime customer."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great price! Excellent condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just what I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve experienced 0 issues with the phone so far & it even came earlier than expected. Works like it’s completely brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had ordered another 11 pro max from a different supplier but I had to return it cuz it wasn't working right but this one is great so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Typing is difficult and frustrating as nearby characters are engaged instead of the ones needed. Care is needed to avoid sending incomplete text when typing close to the right hand side of the screen! I still like my phone and I will buy again or recommend to others."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Our daughter bought this phone and had it less then a month. She purchased screen protectors and a case for it. She is a single parent and needed a new phone. During these times of unrest, in every way imaginable, people tend to do things they normally wouldn't do. In this case, she spent almost a thousand dollars on this IPhone 11 ProMax!! And she didn't purchase the $199 warranty figuring with the price she paid, the phone's endurance would be great. Now the saying goes-""you get what you pay for."" Well, she was entertaining her young child outside. This very expensive phone fell a short way to the ground and landed on a smaller then pea sized rock!! The bottom right side now has a small shattered hole and that part does not work. I contacted this company asking if there was any way they would help her get it fixed-pay for the screen replacement repair, send a replacement screen etc.. They were unsympathetic. Advised her to find a repair shop and have it fixed. Well, I understand there is no warranty under the circumstances, but to get a small amount of help??? We normally buy Samsung phones. We have purchased LGs. Both these brands are more durable and less money then the IPhone. I have accidentally dropped mine-LG-a few times and have had no damage done.
All in all-you don't always get what you pay for. This IPhone is heavy and fragile. The customer service is unsympathetic.
IPhones are nothing more then a status symbol and my daughter now regrets her purchase.
Like I said, during these times of unrest, a little sympathy and help would have been appreciated."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve had it for a couple of days, but its been really good. It came in really good condition, no noticeable scratches on screen or back or edges. So far happy with the phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Usually people buying these products are kind of skeptical about them and they don’t know if they will receive the full product, let alone the product being in great shape. I recently ordered this product but at first I thought it was a scam seeing the reviews so I tried to cancel my order but it was already shipped so I went with it. It arrived a few days early and it was more than I expected! Phone is in perfect condition and it came with a charger and a cable though not the original products but it still came with the phone and the phone had a screen protector added which is nice on top of 90day warranty only case anything goes wrong. Great service! (Fully unlocked, tried my current SIM card and it works!)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had my phone now for a little over 2 weeks. Cosmetically, it looked brand new. I haven’t had any issues. I love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reconocimiento facial excelente batería 80% almacenamiento 256 muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Over priced."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","For those who don't know what unlocked means, it doesn't mean it is for the verizon network. Very frustrating. I thought unlocked meant it was a legit, not stolen, phone. I guess it means that, but then it doesn't mean you can go to verizon. So the phone itself was fine and the seller was great because he took it right back, but I just don't know where you can connect it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything on this product. It works fast, and speedy. Connected to my old phone easily, and can’t wait to start using it. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to buy it. It comes with screen protector in the package and charger, with a booklet in case you wants to return the product. ❤️❤️💝😋😇❤️‍🔥💝"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall the phone is good, the speak isn’t that good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I read some reviews before buying this iPhone saying that some screens were broken and scratched. My iPhone Pro Max came in a box wrapped in a bubble mailer. There was instructions for phone replacement if needed amd came with a generic cord and outlet adapter box. The phone itself was is great condition and was completely unlocked. It worked and so did the charging cord. The IPhone charged quite fast and has a reliable battery. It's not very thick, but is quite heavier than the phone I was previously using. I am personally not bothered by the weight. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is quick to respond and easy to use!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is my fourth Amazon Renewed product I've purchased, and my second phone. As with the other items, this iPhone 11 Pro Max looks and works like new. The battery shows 98% health, and was shipped with a new (non original) 2.4A charger, and 3ft lightning cord. A glass screen protector came pre installed as well. My phone arrived 2 days early which was very much appreciated. I have checked all features of the phone, and everything seems to be in good working order. I feel confident ordering with Amazon's 90 day satisfaction guarantee."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was really nervous about getting a phone on here the phone arrived early has worked really good today nothing wrong with it came charged in all I just put my Sims card in it and it worked so worth it glad I done it but like I said it’s just the first day but it seems to be a good phone"

Everything working however the battery health is at 99% the battery health is important to apple user but for the price, it is worth it and I’m truly satisfied with it. Just wish the battery was at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life impressive"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got my phone I loved it. It worked perfectly. Now, 3 months later, my apps keep closing randomly. I’m not saying that is because of the phone, it could be something else but I have no way of knowing. All in all, I’m satisfied with my purchase and would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like everything about it at first THE SPEAKER IS KINDA BROKEN it words but it sounds harsh and it was difficult cause for some reason it said the phone wasn’t unlocked but I took it to my carrier store and it was all better it’s a good value for you money"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought this on 11/14 and arrived the very next day! Opened up the box and it was packaged up very nice and neat. Came with everything it said it would have.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm always leery of making large purchases of goods that are sight unseen, but took a chance on this phone. It arrived in nearly pristine condition. Very clean, with a minute scratch on the screen (the screen protector I put on makes it invisible). Battery life at 95%. Completely unlocked, so no issues with activating and setting it up. I purchased it from the refurbished Verizon seller. Delivery requires a signature (to avoid potential loss or theft), so make sure someone is home to receive it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","excellent service and excellent product. like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","After not being able to remove the SIM card tray and getting approved to return it, my son in law was able to remove it. He placed my SIM card in it, charged it and it charged quickly with the battery running at 87%. I have gone a whole day without having to put it on the charger. I am extremely happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excellent phone so far o issues. I wish for the high tag price a manual of basic features would have been included, I had to learn te hard way but I Did!Only one issue a black tab bar like appears on the bottom and middle f the phone some times mostly when navigating the web. But that’s a programming flaw. The phone was in new like condition no scratches or defective. I am satisfied with the purchase, was expensive but worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","For a refurbished phone definitely the best value for your dollar"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new, very happy with this product! Highly recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is heavy. It’s thick. I like it. Only thing I have a problem with is the back camera and flash light. It’s doesn’t work and they knew it before sending it to me. Now I have to pay to get it fixed. Great phone just get it from Apple"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo está muy bien hasta ahorita nohe tenido ningún problema"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone esta perfecto, tiene pocos detalles pero para su precio yo creo que valió la pena, estoy muy contento"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had to dig lint/dirt out of the charging port with a paperclip so the cable would fit properly, but otherwise seems fine so far. Got the phone with 90% battery health. Amazon needs to check the cleanliness of that port before shipping phones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buyspry has excellent customer service and quality phones you’d swear my iPhone pro max was new! They ship with a screen protector already on . When I look for a refurbished phone again I’m going to make sure it’s buyspry as the vendor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen has some sort of distortion on it and the camera has some deformities, it is jumping and it is making a weird sound when I try to use the rear camera"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’m so glad I chose this for my upgrade! My old phone was a 6s plus and the battery on that was pretty much nonexistent. I was constantly charging but now I just charge once and I’m good to go literally all day! At first I was VERY hesitant to spend this much money, but I’m so glad I did! Great battery life, lots of storage space and it’s just an all around great phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly I thought it was going to come I’m broke but no everything was perfect the only thing wrong is that it came with a scratch but that’s it only one scrath"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far so good. Just not the color I ordered. I ordered green, but got white. But whatever there’s a case on it anyway."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone 11 Pro Max works like new! The screen is fantastic (and even came with a complimentary screen protector!). My only qualm is that there are several (I believe I counted close to 7-8) nicks in the casing around the edges of the phone. Not terrible... and, certainly not enough for me to send back! It's used, so it's definitely to be expected... I'll hopefully get 2-3 more years out of this model!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone I received Looks Brand New.And came with 92% battery life…Was incredibly worried because some of the comments"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy satisfecho por la compra, llegó en buen estado con una vida útil de batería de 92%, lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 11 Pro Max has been working perfectly so far. The max. battery life is indeed 100%, and it lasts for about 2-3 days, depending on usage. The camera system is fantastic, and I love that there is a specific camera lens responsible for zooming in and out. The phone is fast, as it opens all of my apps and the web browser very quickly. Above all else, I love that the phone has plenty of storage capacity, probably more so than I will ever need. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is in need of one."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Solid choice for a new phone. It arrived quickly in mint condition. If you don’t want to be saddled with a contract, it’s very easy to set up as a prepaid att line. The only issue I’ve had is with the charging cable. It’s not good. But I didn’t buy the phone for the cable, so that’s not really relevant to my thoughts on the product itself. Solid bargain all around."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works great and only had a few scratches around the camera."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has held up great. Forgot how big iPhones are better for me. Have a case and screen protector and alls good in the hood. Micro scratches on screen, but it’s used, only notice them when I HUNT for them."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week Friday and I received it today the 2nd of December which was extra fast. The battery life is 100% which is amazing and the phone came in a really good condition. I love love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So I wasn’t even able to set up facial recognition it doesn’t even work at all and when I try to put in my password it will start typing in random numbers without me even touching it and then disable my phone for one minute I went to the Apple store see if I can get it fixed and they said it was gonna cost $600 because there’s no warranty on this phone from other reviews I’ve read you are probably going to get a 50-50 chance of getting a phone that actually works properly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Honestly, I originally was skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone but based on its physical appearence and performance, Im not too sure if its just renewed or brand new. Very pleased with this purchase. I still don't believe its NOT brand new, no scratches was on it or any type of marks. Zero flaws. Only thing that was missing which is stated when purchasing was not in original package and original apple charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","My iPhone 8 Plus completely cracked on vacation and I needed something to be home by the time I got back so I ordered this phone and it looks brand new and it works awesome, if you’re ordering expecting apple packaging or a brand new phone you clearly bought something without reading the description.... the battery health was at 98% and I’ve had it for 2 weeks and it’s been an amazing upgrade!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The extra storage is amazing! The phone came almost brand new, a big upgrade from my last, even if the battery life is 94% . I was hesitant to buy a phone online let alone at the price, but this was worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is great it has great battery life which is a plus good camera picture more. When I got the phone I didn’t have a case for it for a week and I’ve dropped it many times and it did not scratch or break this phone is a beast buy the way it’s in an outer box now. Lol I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love the pictures"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchase this one because it looks like an iPhone 13 pro but costs less."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first I was skeptical about ordering a phone off of Amazon. But then when the phone came in and I took it out the box, it was gorgeous. It had a few scratches on a camera lenses but he didn’t stop the camera from working. The battery life is amazing. I literally charge this phone once a day. This is the best phone I ever had."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice iPhone, works good and has a nice amount of battery life. Very impressed, highly recommended. Face ID works very good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very good product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve submitted this review already but can’t find it… it had a video that clearly showed the screen scratches but that was deleted from my phone after I submitted the review… not sure what’s going on. It was not grade A renewed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I did order the MIDNIGHT GREEN version but was sent the space grey version. Minor detail as my dad doesn’t care, I just wanted him to have a matching green phone with a green case. Battery is about the same as mine, still is great shape. Was a breeze to setup but, it did have a hell of a time updating. It refused to update via iTunes. I restarted my pc, restarted iPhone, didn’t help. Updated OTA, almost didn’t work. Spent 6 or 7 hours downloading the update (McDonald’s WiFi is slow). Dad is slowly adjusting to an iPhone instead of an android."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The product is so perfect, it feels like a brand new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It's definitely a change from the iphone 8. I've had it for about a week now and it seems to work really well. Getting used to not having the ""home"" button was easier than I thought. The phone is in great condition with a 94% battery capacity, no scratches, and an included screen protector already on the phone. I'll update if anything changes but it seems like a great buy so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love my phone, but when I received it I didn’t check it thoroughly. If I use speaker phone, nobody can hear me. I just went to get it fixed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It was a very expensive iPhone refurbished and did not come with the straight talk SIM card, so cannot use the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came perfectly but it was NOT fully unlocked which is the whole point in purchasing the phone so this was very unacceptable. Tried to connect to boost mobile carrier and was told still locked to sprint very disappointing when I spent my hard worked money, I did receive full refund but I wanted my item I paid."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I replaced a iPhone 6S with 16BGB with this 11 Pro iPhone. What a step forward. Faster processor, better camera, better display, etc. I'm totally satisfied with this iPhone and would recommend to whomever is looking for a new iPhone to purchase. No scratches or defects with this phone and the charged battery last 2+ days."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did have a minor scratch like half an inch on the screen but that’s about it. Everything else working fine, battery in perfect conditions, top and back of the phone in mint conditions. Unlocked so it was just inserting my sim card, putting my iCloud account and ready to go. Face ID flawless like a brand new phone, really no complaints, I’d take that little scratch on the screen for the massive discount I got it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very pleased with the product and customer service"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una belleza, no me hice falsas expectativas porque es muy clara el estatus de renovado, en mi caso recibí la unidad con un pequeño raspón casi imperceptible en la pantalla y con 93% de capacidad de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I ordered this phone here I was worried it would go wrong. But now that I have it in my hands right now I can safely say that it is perfect! Some minor tiny scratches on screen, but barely noticeable. It’s still perfect nonetheless, it’s like if I actually bought it from an Apple Store. So I can safely say this was worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far it’s working perfectly- looks great- battery lasts 24 hours (87% Battery Health) - really works well. I’m glad I bought it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’ve had the phone for a few days now, and all seems well. Great camera quality and responsiveness. Product was packaged as described, with the accessories described in the listing, and it arrived early. Cosmetic damage is as described for refurbished phones (very minimal, no noticeable damage when held at arm’s length.) at this time I am very satisfied with my purchase. However, as I said, I’ve only been using the product for a few days."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone! Like new, no marks at all"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I do not usually order Apple “refurbished” iPhones. I thought I’d take a chance & order it & hope it’s not a piece of scratched up junk.Much to my surprise, I was amazed how “almost new” shape it was in! It had no scratches at all anywhere on it! I set it up and it works Great!The price was perfect!So, I purchased 2 more, one for my son & daughter!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came nice and no scratches or nothing everything worked well but it was lagging when I was trying to set it up but I didn't think much of it and continued to use it but I've had it for 3 days now and I'm going to return it because it has been nonstop lagging and glitching, I've restarted it, deleted stuff, reset it, cleared everything and it hasn't done a thing to help, I was listening to music and it was changing the song that was on, I had a friend next to me and had the phone laying down and neither of us was touching it and it was going through apps and I was on Spotify and it went to Instagram and started playing reels, I will be returning this item and I also believe it is hacked so I don't recommend this item to anyone. DO NOT BUY."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","2 months in... so far so good. Battery capacity was at 100% when I received it. It came with a protective screen on it. Upon taking it off for a more durable screen protector I noticed there were scratches. HMMM... wasn’t too happy about that. But I did save $$$ of dollars buying this renewed. I’ll take what I can get. Scratched are completely unnoticeable when protection screen is on. Woohoo!! Camera game has totally upgraded. 4K videos are poppin! I was able to send high quality interview videos and create great group project videos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone came in 2 days earlier that posted. It looks and works like new! Very happy with this phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice phone. I received the original charger as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it from WBB . Pristine condition. 100% battery Health. Just a tiny bit scratch on the upper right corner not visible though when the screen is on. Works flawlessly. Getting one and half day battery life with consistent usage. Honestly satisfied specially with this price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love This IPhone! I haven’t owned an iPhone Max since an iPhone XS Max; and I wasn’t impressed with it all!This iPhone 11ProMax might be heavier then the regular iPhone 11 but it has tons of features a regular iPhone 11doesn’t! It might be a refurb but it has no scratches on it at all! Love the storage of 512gb! It is lightning fast too!Definitely worth every penny!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Almost like new and included a few months of AppleCare left. No scratches or any flaws. Battery was at 91% as promised. I feel I really lucked out."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","i keep my phone well protected with a nice solid case and screen protector. never abuse or over heat it. it is a company phone so it is used just for calls and txt. after 3 month of use the phone is now useless and is sad because i spent so much money on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new all works perfectly. Battery life 84%it’s fine"

The phone is all original, Face ID works perfect, True Tone works, and 100% Battery health. I couldn’t ask for anything better. Would buy from seller again and this is one of my best purchase that I’ve made in my life! Definitely deserves 5 star rating from me."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like a new phone so far , so good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Description said it worked and looked as new. It arrived with a light and a deep scratch on the screen. Disapointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it for my wife and so far so good, it hasn't given her any problem so i haven't had any problem with it.... Its overpriced as all IPhones are ...the face recognition is just as effective as any other in the market. They did do away with the finger print scanner. thats the only draw back"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The Phone Wasn't Supposed To Come On Until Friday...But It Came Today Instead 😁 The Phone Is Bigger Than I Expected It To Be. The Only Thing I Don't Like Is There's A Scratch On The Screen And Then There's Beat Up Marks Around The Edge Of The Phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","the cellphone it self looked pretty good at first with a very few scratches at the corners , it came with a screen protector applied and i didn't want to listen to other reviews who said that there are scratches on the screen but not visible until you remove the screen protector but in the first day a very weird issue was happening in which the screen become unresponsive after the battery drops below 50% , charge it and it becomes good again ,now this issue had me remove the screen protector to see if its causing the issue which reveled the scratches and a pretty ugly scuff , had to return ."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just as description, like new. Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. I just received the phone today, and I couldn’t even tell that it was refurbished (even though it is). My package contained the phone itself and what I think is the original charger. Some people complained about receiving cheap chargers with their orders, but that was not the case with my order. It looks brand new and works as it should. The phone was also shipped very quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I am satisfied with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es el mejor celular de Apple, el iPhone 11 Pro max"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am absolutely in love with my new phone. Have had it for about 3 wks now and my only complaint was not reading the Apple iOS 14 update before..so camera settings changed. I couldn’t revert. A complete nightmare for 3 days. However, proud of my purchase..worth the “risk”. Money wel spent. Face recognition works even in the dark lol forgive me I love it! Battery life was 100% healthy and works great. I would recommend."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone received in perfect condition. Absolutely no issues with phone or switching SIM cards. My cell carrier is AT&T. Previously had an iPhone 6, so this was a bit of an adjustment getting used to this bigger phone. It’s quite a bit thicker than my old phone, but not an issue. I can still fit it in my back pocket, lol."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery life was at 94% capacity when I got it but considering how good the battery life is ! it was not a problem"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Las cámaras muy claritas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was extremely nervous to order phone from here. I am writing this review to help any ones worries like I had. The refurbished phone I received had a TINY little scratch on top left corner. However the amount of money I saved and stress saved from going into store and purchasing is SO worth it. Highly recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it came in reasonably time. I loved the fact that it was unlocked. It was easy to activate it with my number in minutes. I’m just upset about loosing the finger ID,but what do you expect upgrading from a 6s+ to this now 11 pro max."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ill start off by saying when this arrived the box was ROUGH, i had no hope anything inside was in any working condition. If you handed me this phone without context I would believe it was brand new from Apple. It is spotless, battery lasts nearly two days without charging for me and my screen times is about 16 hours total. The facial recognition is great, albeit wearing a mask nowadays you will have to use the pin to unlock the screen. This is my first iPhone and I have no complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great battery life and everything works as expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Convinient. Excellent condition. Fast shipping."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone I still actually have it my only gripe is that my speakers are not as loud as they should be for the money I spent but everything else works just fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am never buying Amazon renewed ever again. I swear as a someone who refurbishes and repairs phones myself I am appalled at the absolute GARBAGE that passes for quality in this industry. AMAZON should be BETTER than this, to sell something as REFURBISHED that has huge scratches on it like this.but this is not ""Amazon renewed"" this is sold by a 3rd party seller who likely refurbed the device themselves. If I was refurbishing this and selling it for $1030 I would put a new LCD on there if it has a scratch!!!!!!!! They cost like $200. You will still make mad profit off of whoever you bought it from. You can deduct.And Amazon if you censor my review I am turning my dissatisfaction to YOU! I WILL call Amazon corporate if this review is censored like some of mine have been in the past for warning customers about problems.The other problem I had was that I was unable to cancel the order literally 15-20 after making it, and it did not ship for another 24 hours! This is not a ""it already shipped"" problem.So basically I am $2000 in the hole right now and I am going to order this straight from Apple so I know I get a quality product. So $3500 in the hole until I get refunded for the first which should have been refunded and this one with the huge gauge on the screen.Absolutely ridiculous. Stop selling things as ""Amazon renewed"" when they're refurbed by a third party."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in a box with charger, mine had a minor scratch on the top corner on the front and battery health is 87%. Had to call the phone company to set it up. Works well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don’t buy refurbished iPhone people are reporting phone stolen and selling them back"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works perfectly,use it in UAE and works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone and set it up and then the keyboard didn’t work after that. Can I return it and get another one in its place?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone works very well just like brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like it 96% battery but there's no original charger and earphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","everything work perfect, like new iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vida útil de bateria 98%, estéticamente algunas rayas en las barras laterales y en la parte trasera del equipo lo demás en perfectas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything looked and worked flawlessly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hesitant to buy such an expensive phone brand new, but took the risk. I usually sign a finance agreement with T-Mobile for a new phone every 2 years but lately they have not had great deals and financing from them is a 3 year agreement. So, I decided to buy the phone renewed. Surprisingly, the phone arrived a couple days sooner than the expected delivery date. It had not scratches on it. I was able to swap my sim and start using it in a matter of seconds."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the features.Face recognition is the best thing since cane sugar was found. Has good battery life.Good valve for cost."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing much just what I stated"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Really good!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Item was just as described, perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues at all"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first, I was quite skeptical because I had seen reviews saying the iPhones were locked or that they were cracked. But NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE!! Truly a professional seller with care and the utmost quality for their customers. It even had a screen protector pre-installed and its such a small thing, but its things like that make this shopping experience even better. I'll definitely go back to get my next iPhone from them in the future!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Have owned and used extensively for 2 months and 10 days. Have no issues with any aspects. It did come with a glass screen protector installed properly which was nice. Cord and charger were not apple branded which was unfortunate. I""m sure the cord is inferior, but I have other cords around so its not a problem. No earbuds were included. Would accept the aftermarket auxiliary equipment again to save the money given that the phone seems to be pristine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone works perfect was able to activate it with boost mobile easily. The value for the money is great. And the face recognition works perfect. All around a great phone and came with 94% battery life on its battery. So I’m happy with this purchase. And I would recommend this company to purchase from. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Before I purchased phone options were return and refund eligible now they’ve changed it. I wanted to exchange for a phone with a higher battery life (apple recommends new battery at 80% and below) this phone is at 81%. I’ve been emailing seller and they only responded ONCE! Tried to do refund and now I’m asked to pay shipping. I’ll be contacting Amazon this is false advertisement!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It really really in great condition I thought it was new and it was a mistake but good for me that was not the case it was just a great certified great iPhone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got my iPhone 11 pro max a few days ago and I'm very happy. My iPhone came perfect, just a couple small marks of use but it looks super new. The battery life is 95% which is amazing. They sent me a device with screen protector!! I totally recomend you guys to buy from this company."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like the phone but all the previous info from the person before wasn't erased."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se actualizo el teléfono pensando que de esa forma se solucionaba, socio igual. Se reviso los parámetros de teclado y siguió igual. El cristal posterior tenía mancha por debajo del mismo indicando qué tal vez se sumergió el dispositivo. Es una pena, no recomiendo a este vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No regrets"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","In a nutshell, refurbished is a bit of an overstatement. This phone dies pretty quick for it to be the Pro Max as I can’t make it an entire day without charging at least once by the later afternoon. Nevertheless, get what you pay for when it’s an used item. Can’t wait till the next phone release so I can get rid of this."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was skeptical about buying the iPhone 11 Pro Max after reading some of the reviews. But my phone came in perfect condition and there’s no scratches the only thing that I didn’t like was that it didn’t come with the “original” apple charger but beside that I haven’t had any problems with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought two phones a gold 11pro max and a silver 11pro max. My only problem is I activated my sliver 11pro max and didn’t realize the GB is wrong. When I purchased this phone it was suppose to have 256GB however, when you go to the settings it only has 64GB. I am PISSED like I already went through the trouble of activating the phone. Now I have to send it back ASAP because I don’t have nearly enough storage that’s the main reason why I made sure it had 256GB at purchase. I will never use them again.Update: Got in touched with them they said they’ll give me a full refund once I send the phone back. I’ll update again once I do so."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","After 3 renewed and refurbished phones I finally got this one and it was just like new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like with everything on it , a battery heath is 100% brand new. App moving smooth and camera too. Nothing to dislike."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Looks like new. Works like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Can't believe how immaculate the condition of this phone is. Not a single visible scratch, bump or imperfection. All components and functions work perfectly. It came with a black generic silicone case and generic charger. Fully unlocked and the best is battery 100% which to me seems they put a new one. 100% would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm currently living abroad, but I ordered my phone and had it shipped to my parents. My sister unboxed it for me while we facetimed, and she approved the quality! She said the last owner took great care of it, and now she wants to swap phones!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in perfect condition, a big upgrade from my iPhoneX. The front and back cameras are great with a much wider shot! The weight is around the same as the X despite the bigger size. I am using it with Xfinity Mobile with no issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works as expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone I received looks brand new. I'm shocked it's a used device. No issues with carrier or anything I was with sprint they just gave me t-mobile chip now that they are the same company. Got to keep my awesome plan and use the new phone best of both worlds.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am very very happy with this refurbished iPhone 11 Max Pro!!! It’s so much faster than my 16 GB iPhone 6 that I had. Use the little paper clip looking object to easily swap out the SIM card. No need to go to a store to activate it for me! Love this!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular esta en excelentes condiciones, la vida del celular se encuentra en 89%. Estéticamente se encuentra muy bien, no he encontrado desperfectos y me ha dejado muy satisfecho. Eso sí, tener en cuenta que no llega en caja original ni con accesorios originales, de igual forma, pra mi fue una buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received a new phone with 100% battery capacity and a 1-year warranty by Apple. It works and looks like new, no scratches. It also has an original cord and charger (no earphones and original packaging). I was worrying regarding the purchase but I am happy with it now because I got the iPhone I wanted but 300 dollars cheaper.
Great deal!
Update: 3 month after the purchase phone works great."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono tiene grandes señas de desgaste en la pantalla, se nota que se rayó una parte en exceso al pasar el dedo, tiene picada la parte superior y raspado uno de los bordes del lente, el vidrio trasero tiene como manchas, realmente no lo recomiendo ya que estéticamente está como un 6/10 en cuanto a la batería probablemente en 6 meses toque cambiarla porque venía con el 83%"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ABSOLUTELY love my new phone. It came in only two days it was charged so I didn’t need to charge it. There was zero cosmetic damage it was in perfect condition. I have Metro and it hooked right up no problem. I strongly recommend this company I couldn’t be happier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I’m so glad I decided to do this instead of signing another contract. The phone works great and came in perfect condition. Great price, too. Didn’t want to go into debt.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was hoping for a used iPhone or at least with some kind of ""imperfection"" on it, but it is just like a brand new iPhone. Even the battery came in at 100% capacity, really recommend buying one if you are planning to. Excellent purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llegó muy bien, con 89% de batería, todo lo demás en excelente estado, enviaron cargador y cable genérico, no enviaron cargador rápido como viene de fábrica."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","To be honest, I thought that the phone was new and packed in another box! Good buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad que el producto principal está en excelente estado, pero muy precarios los accesorios. De mala calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I know it’s not new but there is a clearly visible scratch on the screen otherwise everything looks ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything appeared great when I first got this but about a week ago was the first time I ever needed to zoom with my camera and it shakes! Even when I steady it on the table. Pictures come out blurry and everything. I tried to contact the seller but I’m past my 90 days they said so I’m out of luck with a very expensive purchase. I wish I knew somewhere I could take it to get it repaired."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just got my iPhone 11pro max today and so far so good it came in brand new condition. I’ll leave a review again later and add an update

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","1) So far everything is working perfectly, not a scratch, 100% battery life, came with a screen protector on.

2) 2 months later and I am still glad I bought this phone. The amazon refurbished has been no different than if I got it brand new.

3) 1 month later, replaced the screen, it costs $329 everywhere right now.. just putting that out there, still paid it, still 5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This iPhone stopped working the GSM, it does not recognize any Simcard. Can you help me?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","from japan"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","hice una compra del iphone renovado y lo cambie porque tenia 90% de bateria con vida util, y opte por comprar el iphone renovado premium, pensando que tendria mucha mas vida util de bateria y llego con una pila de vida util del 91%, es verdad que en la descripcion dice mas de 90% pero 1% no es nada para la diferencia del monto.
en temas de estetica el iphone esta impecable, pero en temas de bateria me esperaba mucho mas, ya que es lo que mas importa en un celular"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone arrived a day earlier and without original cable and accessories buy that what you get when ordering renewed phones, External appearance is pristine and battery health 100%. the phone looks like new. Also I cannot buy AppleCare+ with no apparent reason. Looking into the IMEI everything seems legit and not refurbished or locked phone. Great product and great service from BuySPRY"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So I got this phone everything is great except my screen is Cracked in the middle which led to the corners cracking!!! And I’ve tried to get in contact with someone since I’ve had this phone and nobody has reached out to me to let me know anything!!! Other than that the phone works great!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I really like 👍 this iPhone 11 proMax , it is a Big upgrade for me coming from a iPhone 6 Plus. This phone is my life line it stores, keeps & holds Everything I want & need. It was worth every penny."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works fine great size I love it"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Has scratches and battery health is 87% which means it dies FAST. $750 for a phone that’s not in tip top condition, kinda frustrating and disappointing. I would appreciate if I could have a replacement sent to me because this is now the only phone I have so I couldn’t just send it back until I get a replacement but disappointed to say the least."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","def worth the money"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone it works perfectly other than me not being able to use the facetime app :-( but I’m sure it can be fixed some sort of way. Everything else is perfect I put my SIM card in and I was able to retain the use of my old number and everything. Beautiful!👌🏾😌"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was perfect but it was listed as fully unlocked and it was not which is false advertising. It was policy blocked by consumer cellular. I don't recommend purchasing from this company. It took a whole lot of headache to figure out what company it was locked with and now my daughter has to use this company and not the original company she wanted."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with a cracked screen, sound was muffled with calling and music ect, the camera wasn't cracked but still bad white/circles when I would take a picture with the flash. Battery died way to quick, good picture quality without flash, fast phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The only thing that I don’t like is the fact that I bought it refurbished and the silent button on the side is stuck on the side. I could never get it fixed but can use assistive touch to mute or unmute but for what I paid I wish I didn’t have to do that."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Speakers sound like phone has water damage and very distorted. Everything else is ok. When you renew or refurbish a phone make wouldnt you make sure all features are working properly?"

No flaws, well packaged, came with a charger but no headphones, so i guess that would be many only ding on this deal!! If you want a great phone seriously consider this deal!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","We purchased Iphone 11 from this seller 1.5 years ago and it pretty much started to have problems less than a year later. Now it's stopped working completely.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","So far phone is been working good 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen condition was WELL BELOW expectations. Think keys in the pocket and no screen shield kind of scratches. The aftermarket screen shield hides some of the damage.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The only fault with these phones is the price. Apple gouges! It is a great phone and takes amazing pictures. The upgrade from my 6S+ is remarkable. Still, it took me over a year to work up the nerve to stomach the price."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","For the amount I paid for this iPhone 11 that is not brand new, the battery life is very disappointing. It takes a good 8 hours to charge the battery, and the life of the battery depletes fast. I'll do more research before making a purchase of this magnitude again."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works like it is brand new, no noticeable flaws. Best investment hands down!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Reached out to company and Amazon (since they put their seal of approval on it being refurbished) about the volume on callers end being sketchy at best. Often have to put the phone on speaker bc the caller can’t hear me when phone is up to my ear. (No I’m not muting the phone) This is a known iPhone problem. I can only assume it’s why the phone needed to be refurbished in the first place. Anyway, I asked if a replacement could be sent (less than a month after purchasing phone) and then I send my phone back (or rightfully be charged for replacement). Told no. They said I can buy another one of their phones then send back the broken one. Sure, cause I have an extra $800 laying around to spend on another iPhone to replace the BROKEN one you sent to me?! No I can’t afford to do that. I am disappointed about getting a still broken “refurbished phone”. Save yourself the headache and buy a new phone"

After spending 5hrs downloading updates & setting up phone it turns out the phone only has 88% battery life. PLUS the packaging was terrible. Looked like the phone was thrown into the box. Screen protector was more off than on the phone & the charger wasn’t included (was supposed to be but I don’t care because I have a million iPhone chargers) . Luckily the phone LOOKS new. I don’t have time to wait to return for one with better battery life…So I’m hoping Amazon will reimburse me the difference for “renewed” & “renewed premium”. I won’t purchase a phone through Amazon again."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nothing wrong with my device so far! I love it!! Came with a screen saver and charger.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Folks please remember that this is being advertised as a “RENEWED UNIT”. The amount of refurbishment efforts and QA-QC checks that was supposedly performed on the unit was clearly lacking on this one. After paying nearly $950, any buyer would be expecting, at the very least none of these visible imperfections (photos). Instead, I found a healthy amount of scratches around the entire phone perimeter, even in the area of the camera lenses! Now, what does it say about the overall phone condition, especially if you are planning to keep it for at least a year or two?

Not very pleased with this purchase.

BTW - This is my second attempt buying from this vendor. I initially bought a 256GB IPhone 11 Pro Max Gol (Renewed and Fully-Unlocked) from them. I had to return that one too since it won’t activate or accept a working SIM from T-Mobile. Perhaps, I was just being unlucky as other reviewers posted better results? Oh well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Received it in May and so far so great!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I've had the phone for a week couldn't be happier works excellent no issues , thank you !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came in great condition. Battery 99% . I’m so love in love with this phone . Came a day early .."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen on this phone did not work. When I contacted this seller for support I was informed that I needed to pay and ship this phone back and then they would send me a new one out. I do not trust them to send a new one or one that was not also defective. I have had other sellers send a new item immediately and then I could return the defective device. Very unsatisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love this phone came to me like new not a thing wrong with it just love this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Been using it all day since it arrived. Love it so far. And it’s camera is incredible. Fastest phone I’ve owned so far. Definitely worth 5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono parece como de fábrica, incluyen garantías y lo entregan con cargador y con vidrio templado, muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it! Great condition! Tiny scratch in the screen but nothing major and nothing anywhere else."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not much to say other than it’s in nice condition good battery life and shipped really fast"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I got the phone everything appeared fine. Until I decided to make a call. The speaker of the phone DOES NOT WORK. I messaged the seller about this and he was fully aware that the items had not been refurbished properly. He was aware of the problem and suggested I “go get it fixed for 50 bucks” … I bought two iPhones from them and it appears that they have the same issue. You can only hear the person on the other line if they are on speaker or if your earphones are connected. I would not recommend them at all. I asked for a partial refund and he said I was “ridiculous” and “nah he won’t do that”… This has been an incredibly inconvenient and awful purchase. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came quick and in amazing condition. Also came with a glass ant-crack screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very efficient and fast ordering system and reliable delivery backed by Amazon brand, got this order in less than a week and the phone was just as described."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great quality phone but battery health was 86% :(. Otherwise looks and performs really good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received my phone in time and matched the sellers description. Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nearly new with 93% battery helath"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con bordes golpeados, esperaba algo más nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","avg"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","HORRIBLE!!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Can’t hear when talking on the phone the speaker is so quiet"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great decision to buy refurbished iPhone. This is my second refurbished phone and they work perfectly. I saved money."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Love this phone so much, battery life is long, and I'm on it 24-7!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is beautiful, as expected. However, it is glitchy, slow, and the facial recognition does not WORK. My only option is to go to the Apple store which is 2 hours away from my home. I'm seriously considering going back to my iphone 7...SO DISAPPOINTING!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Personal cell phone, the sound is really low and wont turn up"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Switched from an android to iPhone and so glad I did. Love my phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It looks brand new no scratches at all. With 100% battery life and everything function perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I had to return the phone due to the feel of a cheap screen replacement, felt like plastic and the touch response was delayed. Terrible phone to say the least. I am reluctant to buy another one. I am sure they are not all like this, but how many would you have to buy and return before you get a good phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone, received as expected. It is renewed but works like a new one. will recommend everyone looking to buy iPhone 11 Pro Max. It is fast and so far no problem at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","You’d think after spending 1079 dollars you’d think the person would be nice and include all the stuff like original box the headphones but all it came in was a white box and the charger phone seems ok will update after getting it setup but that was a big let down so now I have to find a original box for it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","using it right now to write this review. love the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Battery Life 63% and the product is different from what was described"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it and pasted it with a film, thinking how so good it is. It turned out that the surface was spent before I pasted it with a film. If I didn't put it on, I didn't know it. I didn't feel very good until I put it on. How can businesses do business like this?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I got this to save myself on some money for a new one. So far, the iPhone came in perfect condition. The battery life is fantastic and no issues. Great purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love the iPhone 11 it is easy to use and has great features"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It’s just great and like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","A few minor surface scratches, but not distracting. Great care in shipping and included all standard accessories. Would buy from seller in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I am using the phone to take photos & videos and post them to social media. I like it a lot!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I received this phone yesterday it’s very happy with the way it looked very easy to transfer from my other phone this morning I saw something funny on the TV went to record and it started humming it does the same thing when I go to take a picture I did notify the company but have not heard back yet so it’s risky business when you buy anything used especially when it comes from across the 🌊"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","At first we were nervous buying a refurbished phone. However we purchased two of them. The phones were easy to swap over. The phones worked and looked like new. I would recommend buying from them."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Everything is going great with this new phone, works perfectly, and looks brand new, it came in a generic box, with generic charger and cable and no headset, but the phone its immaculate. I'm already using it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","don't buy from this seller without purchase of extended warranty"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","quality is very good overall.
Batter life is not what it should be!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone worked out of the box no issues. Was able to connect to my network no problem. Works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Definetly worth the buy had very small smudges on the upper right screen but for the discount get a screenprotecter and you womt notice it best buy on Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got my battery life at 97% and I’m happy but I got the phone front screen scratched deep ones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Like new, my girlfriend loved her gift.
No complaints so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came faster than expected! So far so good...no scratches and the battery life is good and the screen protector was already installed...I am pleased and hopefully all is well later on"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is very slow I’m so sorry I purchased this phone from this company.
It’s been a few months later and I’m still sorry I purchased this phone from this company ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Initially, the phone (iPhone 11 Pro Max) looked fine when I took it out of the box. The outer stainless steel band did have some minor scuffs, but nothing that bothered me. What was peculiar was that the phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, albeit misaligned. I decided to take it off and put my own. And immediately I could notice so many scratches on the screen. It was horrible and well hidden by the screen protector. More than anything, I just want to give this warning: these “renewed”/refurbished phones are not at the same standard like the ones at the Apple Store. They will be scuffed up. In addition, the battery health was at 98% capacity. From personal experience with my XS Max, it took an entire year for it to drop to that point from 100%. I can’t say how all these phones they sell will turn it, since YMMV, but a word of warning"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Value for money
I like it very much because it’s meet my expectations"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente llego como estaba en la descripción."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got it for my wife as an anniversary gift and she won’t put it down. Absolutely loves it !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I like that the phone came with a screen protector… it’s battery life is great (normal)… it’s aesthetics is great quality and looks new… but they speaker on the ear didn’t work from the moment I opened the box… life struck and I had zero time to return this item but you as a seller must fully do a QC on items that are relatively expensive."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The speaker doesn’t work, so I can’t use the iPhone as an telephone, to have a normal phone call I have to use either headphones or the speakerphone. Unfortunately I will have to return the iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came faster than it was supposed to in excellent condition and even had a screen protector."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Está tan perfecto! Me encanta todo está muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone has some type of scratch on it, idk if it’s from the delivery but it’s not coming off"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Front speaker doesn’t work. Hopefully can do a full replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great besides the main screen scratches"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Decided to switch to Apple after my Samsung screen cracked and bit was it a mistake. The refurbished phone was fine. The last time I owned an iPhone was the 3G... and I loved that. But since then there have been little improvements and changes. Compared to Android OS... and value in phone tech for the same price... there is no comparison. I tried hard... but IOS is so limiting, so antiquated, so slow, so many more strokes and presses to do simple tasks that is was painful. I really don't get why Apple fanatics done at least try Android before claiming it is far better like most do. They are ignorant at best."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Rarely write reviews but in this case a must.Purchased this iPhone 11 for my grandsons birthday May 19th 2021 and it was declared dead this November never to be used again.Granted it was a renewed item but at $850.00 you would think it might last longer then 6 mo.The only upside to this story is due to having insurance on that iPhone he was able to buy, for a small price a brand new iPhone 12😊 I personally will never buy a renewed item again."

Phone kept shutting on and off for days(I contacted this company they wouldn’t help) so I had to go to a repair shop! Now not long after I’m having problems stating that there is no sim installed AFTER I went and bought a new SIM card. It has been one thing after the next. I’m out my money and this company is unwilling to help! Would not recommend"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone simply won’t turn on. No external damages or liquid touched the phone.This seller did a poor job refurbishing the phone and won’t take responsibility beyond 90 days.I checked with Apple and they said it’s a used phone from 2019 that isn’t covered by Apple. I feel tricked! And the seller doesn’t care!Ask yourself, will you pay $700 if you knew the phone would stop working 5 months from now? How would you feel?Buy elsewhere!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It says in the description that it’s compatible with sprint and t mobile, but I went to the store and they couldn’t activate it for me, it keeps saying “sim failure” I wasted time waiting for the phone and time at the store trying to activate it, and now I have to wait again for another phone! I got rid of my old phone thinking this is going to be fine as described, but this is probably the most inconvenient experience in my life!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was my second phone from Amazon. First one had Bluetooth issues and this one would type several errant characters when you typed. Poor QC for a “renewed premium”.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Amazing phone!!! Scratch free works fine!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought this phone with the understanding I would be able to get AppleCare but when I try to sign up the apple website says ""We’re sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced."" After this I was thinking about returning the phone within the 3 month return window. Before doing so I dropped the phone and the back glass cracked. I wrote the seller asking if I could return it (even if for a refund for less/just a partial refund) and they said no. Basically once you buy this phone you are on your own so better hope you get a good one!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Works great love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Came with audio issues: I know when phones are renewed they’re not the same as new anymore but come on, having to pay $600 for a phone that has audio problems is not worth it. It was nice but at least making sure everything works makes is worth it. Will never buy from this seller again (scammers)"

So yes, all these things showed after 93 days of using the phone. And they wouldn't exchange my phone since it's after 90 days, but I paid 800 dollars to get a renewed phone that works properly. So I don't believe that it's my fault that these deficits showed after 90 days. I need an exchange, please. Thank you."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in good physical condition. But I then found out the phone vibration motor is broken.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El telefono llego fisicamente bien, la bateria en 98% pero la 1 estrella es por que me vino con el earspeaker dañado, se escucha increiblemente mal, no entiendo como una compañia tan grande como ustedes no se percatan del estado real del dispositivo, yo pague $100 dolares para reritarlo del currier ya que vivo fuera de estados unidos, ahora tengo que pagar otros $100 dolares mas para enviarselos, estoy demasiado decepcionado de ustedes, tremendo dolor de cabeza que me acaban de dar"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone wasn’t new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was nice and all and it worked but when I was trying to get activated with my cellular company they told me the phone was stolen or has been missing. So I beg of you do not get this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone arrived in perfect condition. I noticed that the camera 1.0 was not focusing correctly . I am not sure if it is a software or hardware problem. I decided to return it. If you buy it, make sure to check everything on it. Don’t simply trust just because it is being purchased at Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I would not recommend purchasing a refurbished device from Amazon. Shortly after my 90 day warranty expired my Apple Pay has quit working and is not able to be fixed. Amazon is not able to help me since the warranty has expired. It's not worth saving a couple of dollars ordering it from Amazon, but it from someone that will stand behind device defects longer than 90 days."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I don’t like the fact I bought two of the same items and they had identical scratches on them which were very very visible and deep poor on your side to sell this at such a high price point……."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I think they just sold a poorly refurbished phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","NFC didn‘t work and was defect therefore Apple Pay didn‘t work too. Didn’t expect that when a cellphone is 100% checked and where is the quality management
Even Amazon confirmed the replacement immediately the delivery of the replacement was now the biggest fail. They have sent me a Galaxy S8 instead of the IPhone 11 Pro Max🤮🤮🤮"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone for work purposes, the package does not come in original Apple packaging which was something I did not have a problem with but the first thing I noticed was some scratches on the camera lenses which I was able to ignore until the phone started crashing and lagging after only 1 week of use. I had to take it to a local repair shop and pay $300 to get it fixed which was a real bummer for me. Overall not worth the full price paid (almost $1000)."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Such a beautiful phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I purchased my iphone 11 pro max in August 2020 and now the front camera isn't working properly. It has 2 horizonal lines and purple tint. I contact the seller and he informed me that I had to contact Apple. I went to the Apple store and was informed that this is an hardware issue and it will cost approximately $400 to repair.

The front Faze glass is broken. The phone does function correctly, or it would’ve been returned. Pretty much dissatisfied with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was using a iPhone 6 with the home buttonThis new sleek design has no home button, you scroll from bottom to top. This works 1 out of three attempts. lve lost data, missed calls, cant get into apps or it takes me to wring appCant wait to get my iPhone 8 plus"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","There is an outstanding balance due on this phone purchased and my provider is advising me to pay the balance or obtain another phone. This phone obviously is LOCKED and seller refuses to pay for return shipping. This is absolutely not my fault that I have to return this iphone. Seller needs to take FULL RESPONSIBILITY for his poor process in vetting or reselling iphones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It had scratches on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone doesn’t not work. The phone turned off and on randomly which was weird to say the least. In addition, the charging wasn’t working with any of the 3 original iPhone charges so I had to clean the charging port in the iPhone. Even after the charging started working properly, it turned off and on randomly twice. I don’t recommend buying this product as it does not function as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Now returning this garbage. Seller represented it as refurbished, but Apple said it cannot be used, as cannot purchase cellphone service from anyone. SPRY's satisfaction ratings are poor at best. I would look elsewhere if you are looking for an iPhone that works. Never use these guys again. They misrepresent products in the description. Buy at your own peril."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Screen has been replaced and face ID does not work. these dishonest vendors do not buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This 3/4"" scratch should have been clearly observable upon visual inspection - given that the Apple repair cost of this scratch on this phone is $329 (approximately 1/3 of item price as listed) this is a significant shortcoming on the part of the seller. Do not recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","iPhone looks like new but has a battery life of 80%. Worthless the price in my opinion"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","it's good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","At the beginning when I got the phone, every thing looks new and perfect. I was so excited. But then I started noticing the phone restarts on its own randomly during the day. I may not be doing anything at the moment. But it still restarts on its own. The frequency of restarting began to raise a concern to me. I reached out to the seller Buyspry, they asked me to restore and restart the phone but it did not help. I reached out the apple to find a solution and they said the battery was fine. There were panic logs on my phone as well. Scheduling an appointment with the Geniusbar took forever due to the pandemic. I bought another phone from the same seller but the issue is still the same. The phone also restarted even without me installing anything to it so I returned it. But now I’m stuck with a phone that restarts all the time and they say they won’t accept the return anymore. It’s frustrating. I recommend either try another seller or make sure you get additional insurance."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have had an iPhone basically since they have first started making them. I like iPhones.
But the iPhone 11 is the worst phone I have had in the last 15 years. I hate this phone so much. Just get the iPhone 8 if you want a decent iPhone.
I regret that I did not do further research on this piece of junk.
Ever aspect sucks. It has issues pairing with Bluetooth devices. It has issues with syncing to files, connecting to WiFi. The finger print scanner is gone and sometimes the phone will open up quickly and other times it takes 30 seconds just to get the screen to light up, even when poking it with a finger over and over (no case or anything to prevent it from having issues here).
Trust me, I like iPhones. Never had any of these issues before. Save yourself the overpriced amount that this phone is and even more so, save the frustration that comes with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought the phone from apple, it was more expensive, but it came with warranty. I would recommend to upgrade if you have the money to spare, but if you have the iPhone x or newer is not worth it as you will not feel much difference."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","the iPhone came ! It works perfectly fine I was scared to order because of the negative reviews but it came in perfect condition.
Update : couple weeks later it’s still working perfectly fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love every thing about this phone the emojis when you face time to"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Best thing I ever bought."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not worth 1 star. DO NOT ORDER!!!
I reture the phone since June 29. They got the package since july 1 but they dont refund the money back. I calling them everyday nothing updates. Only thing i want is the money back so i can order another phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I love it. Worth every penny and picture quality is amazing. Thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It arrived in excellent condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The screen suddenly magnifies to a point you are not able to even turn it off for a reset. The screen freezes and will not allow any movement to clear the screen and return to the usable screen one to open another app. This requires that you try and turn the phone off to hopefully re-set itself but the screen is magnified so large that turn the turn off slide is barely visible by one of it's edges.
FRUSTRATING !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I bought it brand new and the phone died after 4 months (we're talking about a phone thats worth more than a $1,000). Lost all the info and images. Took it to Apple, they ""fixed"" it and returned after several days. The fixed phone lasted only 2 months and started restarting non-stop. Will never buy an Apple product again. Read on the internet, there millions of people complaining about Apple products."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is the best thing ever I need a nother one for free please."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Suck"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worst Amazon Experience till date with a third party seller. BuySRY is the name i think. JUST DON'T BUY THIS. You'll regret it. The item is defective and the seller will promise you resolutions after proof only to deny you everything. Horrible experience and i hope no one has to go through the same thing again. Poor communication by the seller and Amazon reps also led to more hassle. Had to get a resolution from the executive team who were very helpful."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Absolute garbage. These aren’t renewed, they are just old used phones. Both of my iPhones came with marked/scratches up screens. The bottom of the phones also have a void sticker."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Why the hell would you spend that much!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It did not meet my needs"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Don't waste your money the phone is a hunck of junk you can't download very easily and no power supply and no manual for phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone arrived without a SIM tray. I cant determine if its locked or unlocked . had some wear and scratch. Will update review ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","you might as well pay for a brand new phone on the apple website. why pay this price for a refurbished discontinued iphone... come on guys"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Scean broken."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","High price and low specs as compared to Huawei P40 pro."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It is a USED Phon Not a brand new one!
Be aware people!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It glithes a lot I would not buy it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone!! Make sure you order the upgraded refurbished from Amazon. Do NOT buy from a third party. Both my past two phones were from buyspry and Jem jem. Horrible phones. Visible scratches and degraded batteries. I made certain that this time is was actually refurbished by Amazon and I couldn’t be happier. Absolutely NO scratches. 99 percent battery health. Looks brand new and works brand new as well. I love the larger screen. Perfect for gaming, reading, watching movies etc. The camera is phenomenal! Sound is nice and sharp. Synced up beautifully with my Apple watch, iPods, blink cameras and beats headphones. Will update if anything changes or goes wrong. However, so far, after a week it’s still performing wonderfully."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all, look at the trade in value at the top of the listing. They currently give UP TO $491 for an 11 Pro Max. That would be for a 512GB in perfect condition. For the 256GB I ordered in ""fair"" condition for $742, they probably gave the previous owner $300-$400. After receiving the phone, they dust out the holes, give you $10 worth of a cheap short charger cable and transformer brick I already have tons of. Then jack up the price $300-400 for 15 minutes of work and $30 in shipping / charger cable.

I paid $742 and $750 for the first and second phones I ordered respectively. The first phone came with a chinese aftermarket screen. Newer iphones can detect when an aftermarket screen is used and AFTER transferring all my data it appeared with the message. About 1 in 10-20 keystrokes would misregister and the key next to it, even sometimes across the keyboard it would hit backspace. The 3D touch would not work properly either and the color shade was off from a genuine screen. Another issue when replacing screen is the waterproof seal is broken. While this is replaceable when replacing the screen, who knows if it was done at all, much less properly. This phone arrived totally dead, which is TERRIBLE for lithium batteries. The battery was at 90% of new capacity, which is the bare minimum for what I would consider acceptable on a $750 phone.

With that POS on the way back to the seller, I decided to take a chance on a second one, this time for a few more dollars. It arrived about 50% charged, which is best for long term lithium battery storage. However, the battery was already down to 84% of new capacity. With 6 months of use it would likely be down another 5-10% capacity. At 75-80% the phone actually slows down to reduce power consumption. I don't consider this to be acceptable for how much they want for these used phones. I purchased this hoping to get 2-3 years of use from it, but the factory battery will be absolutely pathetic if used for that time already starting from 84%.
I have swapped many iphone screens and batteries, each generation Apple makes it more challenging. This phone would be my most difficult yet. Also the chinese batteries sold on this site are always sketchy and iffy on quality vs a new genuine one that you can't purchase from apple."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got the iPhone 11 Pro Max with “renewed premium”. Phone is perfect cosmetically. Worked out of the box and activated seamlessly. Recommend this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This is the second iphone I buy refurbished from Amazon (1st time from this seller). Everything works great on this phone! I tested face recognition, touch screen, phone calls and camera. Functions as intended. Battery percentage is good at 87% (same as my last phone) and it came in completely unlocked and ready to go. No visible scratches on screen, back glass or frame, I’d rate this products appearance a 9.5/10 looks almost brand new. This specific one is the rose gold with 256gb storage. The packaging was a little lacking in interior padding but the phone arrived undamaged. Also came with an original charger and cable which is a plus!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this to replace my iphone 8 plus. Apple and my cel carrier had the 12 and 13 on back order but I dont need the latest model. I got the 11 refurbished and unlocked and saved hundreds of dollars but got a much better phone with waaaay more storage. So now I can download all the apps without worrying about my phone not having storage. It was pretty easy to transfer all my contacts etc to the new phone too. I am thrilled with this purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","First, I think I should mention that there’s no damage to the screen but there’s a considerable amount of scratches to the body. There’s no earbuds in the box and you receive cheap 3rd party accessories. Since this is a renewed product, I would be okay with this. However, I’ve come to discover that I received a 256 GB instead of the 512 GB option I ordered. This is either a mistake from the seller or an outright scam and misinformation on the listing. PLEASE check your device’s about section to check the storage capacity. I’ve decided that I’ll never buy Amazon renewed products again and will buy from my carrier or from Apple themselves. I encourage you to do the same."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","First of all this Seller on Amazon is great to work with ! I was having an issue with the phone that I couldn’t figure out and this seller went out of their way to help. I didn’t want to return the phone as it is great. So you can buy with confidence from them. I was also worried about ordering a refurb phone from some of the experiences of others But all has been just fine here. The phone is pristine condition and seems to be working great ! I guess time will tell but right now I am happy and I would definitely buy from this company again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","$570 por esto!, estoy realmente sorprendido, es un buen teléfono y me parece su punto más fuerte el 94% de vida útil de la batería, llego el mismo día que lo pedí gracias a Prime, su caja traía un cargador genérico y un protector de pantalla de vidrio, algo normal en los teléfonos de segunda mano es los rayones, este venía con dos rayones bastante grandes en la pantalla, (No interfieren con la visión de la pantalla y no se perciben a una distancia considerable), cuando puse el protector de pantalla desaparecieron por completo así que es un buen punto, un case y todo esta perfecto, espero siga así estos meses, todo parece bien, la tarjeta sim la tomo sin problemas y tomo solo unos minutos en llevar la información de mi viejo Iphone a este. Es un buen celular, mucha suerte, espero que compres uno y el vendedor te envíe uno bueno!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Just couldn’t get my self to pay what AT&T wanted so I started looking around for alternatives. Found this phone on Amazon and ordered it based on their return policies if not satisfied.
The phone arrived fast (as promised) and was packed in a nice new box (not the AT&T or Apple version). Finish was close to perfect, it worked fine and my wife loves it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","For a refurbished phone, this device is in excellent condition. It’s super clean, not a single scratch or dent. It’s really immaculate and I’m super happy to purchase from Buyspry. Battery life was 88% really low but it could pass.

Kudos to the team for this amazing device."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Ordered and received in less than 24 hours as promised. Opened package and found the phone didn’t have a scratch or even a fingerprint on it. Looked brand new.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have bought over five phones from Amazon Renewed Premium. They are priced lower and better than Apple refurbished. I have not purchased a new iPhone for the past many years."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I first got this iphone was wondering what was wrong the camera it was the screen protector that I put on the phone but after a call with the customer support they really helped guide me to the solution.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone was in immaculate condition. Great battery life. Delivered within stipulated times."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Nice device!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good deal"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The iPhone is not in the iPhone original box and the adapter the charger is not Apple brand"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone quality was perfect, seemed brand new. No scratches or nicks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I have to start this review off by saying there is absolutely no reason why you should be buying a brand new iPhone if the renewed version is available for hundreds of dollars less. The phone I received had one VERY minor imperfection, but it was something that was easily hidden by a case. In my experience, very few used phones come with zero scratches, so you have consider the ones with an imperfection on the side or on the back as a perfect used phone. Remember that it isn't new, but you can make it look new by putting it in a case. That's what I did and none can tell. Buy renewed from Amazon!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","It didn’t even last a week. The screen came off within the same week I received the phone & I had a screen protector and a hard back case & never even dropped it . Now I’m back using my old phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","i like the camera...how fast it is when I look thru my apps..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buena calidad del empaque, producto en excelentes condiciones y funciona a la perfeccion"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone looked great and worked great, but the parts they Renewed in the phone made it not able to connect to a network. It had two sims that wouldn't work. And one of them was a internal sim which the 11s don't have. So they put a part for say a 12 or 13 into the 11 making it not usable as a cellular device. Glad I can return to get my money back but wish I could trust amazon to have a device I could use."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Worth it all"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This phone is renewed but when it arrived it looked almost brand new! I almost couldn’t tell it wasn’t brand new, wonderful job!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone is in good condition just cameras on back are scratched."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought refurbished from Amazon, had reservations but all is working. Read MANY reviews and came to conclusion that this was the best choice for me. Many reviews said that buying up to the 12 or 13 model was overspending and not gaining much.This phone works great, enjoy the speed and all the other features not on previous phone.
I did buy the extra 1 year guaranteed, I think is was an extra $60. but made me much more comfortable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","That phone is very good no don't a problem use so far way look good now thank so much Amazon-like phone bye"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","almost in perfect condition. no screen scratches. 95% battery capacity which isn’t bad for used. but in the dark, the front camera SUCKS. it’s weird because it’s only in the dark. might be a software problem on apple’s part though. everything else was entirely perfect. worth every penny."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Item came as described. Gently used and no obvious defects other than a few slight scratches on screen. Phone came with a screen protector already installed. Battery life seems normal. I can play fortnite for hours before having to charge. Sound quality is also good. Phone should have been a signed delivery package and not left on doorstep.

There are multiple issues with this phone. first being hidden under the screen protector the screen is not fully repaired, you can find some scratches here and there. the refresh rate is slower, connectivity with wifi is super, and last but not least why is it not water-resistant? this thing can last 30 min under water but mine is not even a second. now I need to get a new phone because this thing is water damaged."

HORRIBLE NOTE: I just want to open up the app and be able to write on it like I do on my Galaxy. No not that easy
Pictures of dog have blazing yellow I with no easy way to prevent it. They want want me to edit it after the fact.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono tardó una semana en llegar, un día antes del previsto, la verdad llegó de muy muy buena calidad, hasta ahorita que llevo 2 horas usándolo funciona perfectamente, lo uso con red Telcel y agarró perfectamente la señal, de igual manera estéticamente se ve casi en perfecto estado, solo un pequeño golpe en una esquina pero lo único, en la pantalla todo perfecto, sin ningún detalle y era mi mayor miedo porque vi muchos comentarios donde estaba rayada y este llegó todo perfecto, bocinas, Face ID, llamadas, cámaras, todo en perfecto estado, como si fuera todo nuevo. El único detalle es que llegó con 84% de batería, yo creo que un poco más y ya todo hubiese sido perfecto para mi, llegó en una carga custom y el cargador y el cable no son originales, para que tengan en cuenta eso. Por el precio me parece una compra excelente y yo si recomiendo ampliamente comprarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buen Producto, me llego en buenas condiciones y llevo un mes y no me a causado fallas!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me parece una excelente compra por el costo y el modelo del telefono, aun cuando ya tiene sus añitos funciona muy bien y aun le quedan otros años de actualización.El unico detalle que yo le encontré, es que le cambiaron la pantalla, no es la original de Apple, aun así es una buena pantalla, también es oled, pero si la comparas con otro iphone con pantalla original si se ve la diferencia, pero es algo que realmente en el dia dia ni se nota, funciona muy bien.Estéticamente llegó bien sin detalles y con pila al 89%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Parese nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en buenas condiciones la batería no llego perfecta, el aspecto es bueno, únicamente el sonido para las bocinas si está dañado, pero todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego bien empaquetado con un cargador genérico y el celular, es lo único, de primera vista solo tenía un rayadura en la pantalla pero con una mica de cristal se arreglo, no se ve nada, de batería llego al 87%, lo uso casi todo el día y al final de mi día laboral con un uso cotidiano; llego con el 50-40% de bateríaTengo el de 512 GB, a lo mejor tuve suerte pero fue una buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estética casi de nuevo, sólo tiene unos muy ligeros rayones en la pantalla que con una mica de cristal ya no se perciben. Marcos y parte posterior como nuevo. Supuestamente vienen con más del 90% en condición de batería y me llegó con el 88%, incluso en un checklist que te envían, así dice. Le doy una calificación de 9."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","compre este articulo hace ya año y medio masomenos sigue en buen estado, excelente la camara, lo unico que he tenido problemas es que no se escucha cuando me llaman y tampoco vibra cuando me llaman pero todo lo demás todo esta excelente.cuando me llego venia con dos marcas de chupones al frente dando a entender que ya lo habían abierto, así que nuevo nuevo pues no es.lo revise y si decía que ya había sido abierto.pero bueno de todo lo demás estoy muy contenta con el telefono."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Este equipo lo adquiri con el vendedor Buyspri, todo esta perfecto tiene estética de 10/10, condición de batería 84%, en mi caso un detalle seria que al equipo se le hizo un cambio de pantalla pero fue realizado por apple & trae todas sus funciones al 100%"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Trae todo sus accesorios, exelente condicion,muy bien empacado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","me llegó en buenas condiciones y si es original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estaba en excelente condición"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, estética de 9.5/10, le doy esta calificación por el echo de que yo esperaba mejor volumen en el altavoz, también yo esperaba mejor condición en la batería, me llego con un 84% que no está tan mal pero si muy pronto tendré que cambiarle la batería al dispositivo, que ahí si ya le sumaría otro gasto, fuera de eso todo salió bien, me agrado que llegara pronto hasta antes de lo esperado, que llegara con garantía también y todo bien empacado, solo por el detalle de la batería y del altavoz le doy 4 estrellas, le daría 4.5 pero Amazon no me permite poner .5, también esperaba un cable original pero el genérico está bien y también esperaba que llegara con un cubo de 20w pero llego con un cubo bueno y me agrado la compra, recomiendo al vendedor al 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En estética parece nuevo, no tiene ningún rayón ni golpe ni nada, la pantalla trae una mica protectora que no le quise retirar. Funcionalidad al 100 sin ningún detalle. Es que prácticamente parece nuevo en verdad, el único detalle que podría tener es que la pila tiene una condición del 85% pero hasta ahora no me ha resultado en un problema, ha aguantado perfectamente todo el día. Excelente compra hasta ahora."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Como nuevo. Todo fantástico."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Funcionalmente bien, aunque encontré detalles en las condiciones físicas del iphone como unos rayoncitos alrededor de las cámaras, y en los botones. A primera vista sí se nota que tuvo un buen tiempo de uso, pero no hay una falla o golpe mayor que sean muy notables"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en muy buenas condiciones el celular 👌👌 si lo recomiendo y aparte el soporte de atención a cliente muy buena !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Casi un año con el y mi compañero de viaje no me ha dejado tirado"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo prácticamente nuevo, con 100 % de estética, batería al 90%, hasta ahora funcionando a la perfección, llevo 3 semanas con el ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","el dispositivo esta en perfectas condiciones, veo que trae soporte técnico applecare si es valida esta garantia ?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó con 85% de batería. La verdad usándolo bien bien te dura la batería un día.En cuanto a estado del equipo, el teléfono llegó sin un solo rayón, ni parece usado, la condición es excelente.Obvio, llega en una caja diferente a la original, bien sellada eso si, también trae un cargador y cable súper genéricos, pero funcionan.Por el precio, está bien. Es un excelente producto, muy recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Despues de 2 meses de uso no me ha dado ningun problema, me llego con 100% de bateria"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo ya con el 1 mes y todo Perfecto llego con el 90 de batería y sin ningún golpe anteriormente había comprado otro iPhone pero con distribuidor de Amazon y lo tuve que regresar al mes por que se calentaba y se perdía la señal con este hasta ahora todo bien!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone is in great condition, battery life is phenomenal, priced less than purchase of a new one, so saving money is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, lo recomiendo pero mucho ojo con la condicion de la bateria"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encanto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","bueno en relación calidad/precio, si lo volvería a comprar.El unico detalle es la batería no esta al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy impresionado con la estética del equipo celular, sin ningún rayón, el equipo es totalmente nuevoVolvería a comprar otro celular sin problema, 100% recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","pues esta apenas todo va bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","LLEGÓ CON EL 100% DE BATERÍA, HA FUNCIONADO MUY BIEN, SIN PROBLEMAS, Y FÍSICAMENTE PERFECTO."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si venia muy maltratado más de los demás que he comprado como reacondicionado pero su funcionamiento es bueno pero no se siente como otros enviados directo de Amazon. Desde el embalaje y caja en una caja sencilla que hasta da miedo pensar que lo enviaron en paquetería y fue por ahí brincando.Y este tocó que estuviera como manchado de la pantalla pero sólo del cristal y solo se ve si lo ves a contraluz y un poco rayado del cromado del arco pero con el case ya no se ve."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llegó con 85% de batería, tiene un pequeño rayón perceptible en la parte de las bocinas inferiores. Salvo por eso la estética es casi perfecta, estoy contento con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Después de casi un año de uso, el iPhone funciona perfectamente bien. La verdad tenía el pendiente de comprar un celular reacondicionado pero hasta ahora absolutamente todo sirve EXCEPTO por las bocinas; no están reventadas pero tampoco están funcionando al 100% (si utilizo el altavoz en una llamada a veces puede ser difícil de escuchar). De cualquier forma como utilizo audífonos y la bocina superior para llamadas no me representa ningún problema. Cuando me llegó, me llegó en caja genérica y sin cargador. NO me llegó con abolladuras o pantalla rayada o cualquier detalle visible. Se veía prácticamente nuevo. La verdad si lo recomiendo porque los precios del Iphone Pro Max en México en esas fechas estaban por 20-30 mil pesos en diferentes tiendas y me ahorre un montón de pejedolares."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hice mis compras con diferentes vendedores pero el mismo producto Amazon me lo marca en el mismo lugar.En la primera compra el celular venía perfecto, batería al 100% sin ningún detalle estético, original y prácticamente nuevo, lo único fue que no venía liberado, no me pudieron ayudar y tuve que devolverlo, ese vendedor ya no tenía más dispositivos, tuve que buscar otro.La segunda compra, el celular funcionaba ""bien"", me llegó con 85% de batería y muy manchado del cristal de la parte trasera, así que eso no me agradó y decidí darle la oportunidad unos días, pero revisando con otros iphone de conocidos,!la cámara venía de muy mala calidad!, se veía muy borrosa a comparación de los otros celulares, eso fue lo que me hizo decidir regresarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto me llego con un día de retraso, llego en una caja genérica. El cargador también genérico.La estética le pongo un 10, la pantalla vino con mica de cristal templado.No le he notado ningún rayón en la pantalla ni nada. Llevo poco mas de una semana con el, y hasta ahora funciona bien. En cuanto a la degradación de la batería llego con el 93%.El producto lo compre en $11,999 a 1 año, a meses sin intereses.Lo negativo:Al momento de actualizar a IOS15.5 la batería se degrado al 88% (ver imagen) pregunto:Esto es normal?Ya me comunique con BuySPRY y me respondieron, les mande la captura de pantalla de la salud de la batería, así como el IMEIConclusión: En general estoy contento con la compra, el único defecto, es que la salud de la batería se deterioro, al actualizar el sistema operativo. por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bought a beautiful iPhone 11 Pro Max for $575. Phone is in about excellent 9.5/10 physical condition. Came with a aftermarket charger and cable. 86% battery capacity. Took about 1 week to come from Kansas to Ontario. Factory reset and unlocked.The only thing is… the ear speaker was very crackly and distorted at any volume. It sounded like a blown speaker and made it quite hard to understand people when using the phone as a… phone or watching videos.Seller offered a full refund and sent a shipping label. It turns out (after talking to a phone repair company) the speaker mesh was caked in fine dirt and grime, duct tape pulled the dirt from the ear piece. Works like new now but I guess it wasn’t fully “clean” as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estéticamente luce como nuevo salvo uno que otro detalle, igualmente su funcionamiento es correcto a excepción de la bocina que tiene distorsión y al subir el volumen se nota aún mas que truena. Pienso en si mandarlo limpiar o regresarlo para el rembolso, alguien sabe si lo mando limpiar ya no se hace valida la garantía?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llegó con el 85% de la batería y las bocinas no se escuchan bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es reconstruido como dicen, lo malo es que no utilizan partes originales por lo tanto el teléfono tiene la característica de detectar el componente que no es original. A pesar de todo esto el teléfono funciona correctamente, hasta el momento no he encontrado ningún problema para su correcto funcionamiento. en cuanto a la estética es prácticamente nuevo no cuenta con ninguna rayón. Porcentaje de la batería es del 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El proceso de adquirir mi dispositivo fue muy particular ya que encontre la publicación y 20 minutos despues decidi comprarlo, obviamente por ser una compra por internet de un celular “caro”, “discontinuado” y re acondicionado no me sentia del todo seguro, ya que pense que iba a ser un tipo de estafa o no iba a llegar en las condiciones que yo esperaba, afortunadamente todo lo que pensaba termino siendo falso ya que llevo aproximadamente 2 semanas usandolo dia y noche y no me ha presentado falla alguna hasta el momento, cabe destacar que lo recibi sin daño alguno y con la condicion de mi bateria al 94%, me apoye mucho de los comentarios de la publicación y estuve consciente de que era confiar y tener un poco de suerte en que no llegara dañado, repito, hasta ahorita todo ha ido bien y lo seguire usando dia noche, afortunadamente igual el celular cuenta con garantia con amazon y es original, igual desconfie un poco por el precio ya que en otros lugares valía más y por menos capacidad en la memoria, pero un consejo que les puedo dar es que lo intenten, comprenlo, pruebenlo, chequen como aplica la garantia y en caso de que les falle lo devuelven sin ningun tipo de problema."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno dispositivo si lo encuentras en oferta aprovecha llegó con 94% de bateria funciona con Telcel en México y con Redi Coppel sin problemas con Altan redes"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","This was a great purchase, my old phone broke and needed a new one ASAP without wanting to spend too much. Shipping was fast and when I got the phone in hand I couldn't even tell it was used. Literally no scratches, scuffs, marks, dents, dirt or anything along the lines, the phone looked perfect. When I turned it on to use, setup was easy and without any problems even though I am in Canada and the phone is from the US. The battery is at 100% capacity and lasts me the whole day + some without charging. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and it has been great.There was only one problem I ran into which was my connection dropping frequently but after taking out my sim card and cleaning it and putting it back in the problem seemed to have went away, so I will update if this problem comes back, but so far it's good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 10 días con el teléfono, llegó en muy buenas condiciones, en una caja genérica con cargador y cable genérico como lo menciona en la descripción, no traía ningún rayón en los bordes o en la parte de atrás, le quité la mica protectora de la pantalla y solo trae dos pequeñas rayitas como si lo hubiesen metido a la bolsa y se hubiese rayado con monedas o llaves, pero no afecta el funcionamiento, le volví a colocar la mica y todo parece nuevo, ya no tenía garantía apple care, trae una condición de vida del 91% y me indica que sigue calibrando la batería, al término de la calibración bajó a 89%, me hubiese gustado que viniera con más condición de vida como leí en la mayoría de comentarios que traían arriba del 95%, pero bueno, el face id funciona muy bien, el volumen, micrófono y bocina funcionan muy bien, la cámara es una belleza, y creo que fue una buena compra, es recomendable comprar el cable y cargador original para mantener la batería en buenas condiciones, según Apple tener hasta un 80% de batería es óptimo, aunque repito, me hubiese gustado que trajera mejor condición que 89%…aun así es una buena compra. Espero siga funcionando de manera adecuada."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Después de 3 meses de uso, el celular funciona sin problemas. Vale la pena adquirir estos productos. Me llego con 86% de batería y algunos rayones en la pantalla. Con el protector de pantalla no se nota ningún rayón"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio tenia dudas por algunos comentarios negativos que llegue a encontrar, decidí arriesgarme y realicé la compra. El paquete llegó 2 días antes de lo estimado por lo cual fue bastante rápido. En cuanto a la estética es bastante buena, ligeros rayones en los cromos laterales y un pequeño rayón en pantalla, que se disimula bastante bien con un protector de pantalla, en cuanto a la parte trasera, la estética es impecable, en cuanto a batería llegó con un 86%.Llevo poco tiempo usándolo y hasta el momento no ha presentado ningún problema. El único detalle negativo que encontré, fue el cargador y cable que traen, se sienten de muy poca calidad y la carga es bastante lenta. Recomiendo comprar uno original para evitar problemas posteriores con la carga o batería del equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","LO COMPRE POR QUE ME ABURRI DE LIDIAR CON EL ALMACENAMIENTO CON OTROS IPHONES, ME DEDICO A LA CREACION DE CONTENIDO ASI QUE EL ALMACENAMIENTO ME ES INDISPENSABLE, PARA MI FUE UNA INVERSION MAS QUE UN LUJO. Y ESTOY SATISFECHO, SIN EMBARGO HAY QUE SUPER CUIDARLO POR QUE ES ALGO PESADO Y UNA CAIDA DUELE."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llegó en condiciones perfectas, prácticamente nuevo. Recomiendo comprar"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Después de una pésima experiencia con achemex con una primera compra donde me llego una pila en vez del iphone, escogí a buyspry por sus buenos comentarios, me llego un equipo con batería al 83%, todo original excepto el display, la aplicación 3utool me indico que fue cambiado y si se nota porque tiene algo de pegamento a los costados, el display esta un tanto rayado por el uso y todo lo demás esta impecable, debido a la urgencia que tengo decidí quedármelo, pero estará al pendiente del funcionamiento,"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Vamos, el teléfono en sí es de muy buena calidad y por el precio, vale la pena comprarlo.Apenas lo recibí hace unos días y estoy probando su funcionamiento, rendimiento y funciones para decidir si es un equipo que vale la pena quedarme o hacer efectiva la garantía de 90 días que se ofrece al adquirirlo.Hasta el momento los detalles que he encontrado, a pesar de saber que es un equipo usado, tiene bastantes rayones en la pantalla frontal que no afectan el funcionamiento y suelen pasar desapercibidos con una mica protectora, algunos detalles en los biseles de las cámaras y dos o tres golpes y raspaduras en los bordes del teléfono, no parece nada grave pero la estética deja que desear y ""se nota"" que es un equipo usado.Otro detalle, la batería llegó al 87%, comprensible al ser usado, pero sería un plus que tuviera por lo menos un 90%.En general con la compra, bien, nada extraordinario pero con miras a hacer uso de la garantía."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente, en primer lugar el dispositivo venia sin ningun daño fisico, lo revisé a detalle y no encontré ni un solo rayón, vino sin problemas de software y la condición me llego en un 85%, pensé que sería un problema eso de la batería pero la pila me dura todo el día, llevo usandolo dos meses y no he tenido ningún tipo de problema, las reseñas que leía antes de animarme a comprar el iphone me desanimaban un poco, pero decidí arriesgarme y estoy muy contento y satisfecho con la compra, 100% recomendado!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone came in pretty much 2 days! seller shipped the phone immediately and it got to me with no issues. Phone was wrapped very well inside the box.So far everything in the phone works perfectly fine.I'm slightly disappointed in the battery health, was anticipating a minimum of 85% but this one was 84%. My other iphone 11 I've had for over a year (I bought renewed as well), is currently at 86%. But that's my only let down. I belive the listing says between 80-100..I can't remember.I'll update if the phone gives issues, but so far everything works perfectly fine. And for the price I paid, I thought it was way to good to be true. As of 2022, I paid 750 (no tax either) for a 256gb iphone 11 PRO MAX! If you're unsure about buying with this seller, I say you take a chance! I'm satisfied with my purchase (so far)Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en perfecto estado de todo en excepción de que la bocina de el audio donde contestas las llamadas estaba un poco sucia pero la lleve a que le hicieran limpieza general a todo el dispositivo y quedo en perfecto estado, me llego con un 94% de batería es el 3 aparato que compro renovado y no he tenido problema alguno con ninguno de ellos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo, al principio dude mucho en comprar usado ya que he leído algunas reseñas malas y otras buenas, en mi caso el equipo que me llegó no ha presentado problemas (3 meses de uso).Llego bastante bien empacando, sin rayaduras, sin golpes, el teléfono estaba bastante bueno.Claro que se paga un poco más por Amazon pero estás pagando SEGURIDAD y CALIDAD, cada teléfono viene con una tarjeta de inspección llenada a mano sobre alguien que inspeccionó y limpio el teléfono.Llego con el 90% de la capacidad de batería que promete la publicación y no he tenido temas que laPila no dure o que se caliente el teléfono.Si estás dudando en si confiar o no en Amazon Renewed usa esta reseña como una evidencia que cumple con lo que promete y tienes la ventaja de regresarlo si no cumple con tus expectativas o con la descripción."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el teléfono llego impecable con un 92% de batería, con el color que pedí incluso ya venía con un cristal de protección.Lo que no me gusto es que viene con un cargador genérico que no es el original y se calienta mucho cuando lo pongo a cargar y en solo 2 días bajo de 92% al 90% la condición de la batería. Considero que por el precio de $15,500 pesos debió incluir un cargador original para que esta parte no se afecte ya que al ser un producto re acondicionado esto si le afecta al teléfono y es costo cambiar una batería nueva. (PD mándenme un cargador original 🙏🏼)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno pues el producto me llego en buenas condiciones pero en la parte dela bocina , se ve un poco rallado pero con una funda no se nota , del prosesador esta muy bien me llego con el 87% de pila y llevo ya 3 dias usandolo y esta bien. lo bueno que se tiene 90 dias de garantia"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Sabemos que un teléfono reacondicionado puede traer algunos detalles, pero igual esperamos que sean menores y que valga la pena lo que estamos pagando. No se si en las fotos se alcanzará a apreciar pero el teléfono llegó con un golpe importante en una esquina y varios rallones profundos en la pantalla, por lo que decidí que lo voy a regresar."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El costo- beneficio del producto es bueno siempre y cuando funcione"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono es bueno cumple con todas las funciones y la batería al 90% como lo menciona en la descripción solo que Tengo dos meses con el y el cargador ya no funciona ninguno de los doscable ni el cuadrito de la corriente, en el producto si especifica que el producto como es refurbished no contiene accesorios originales pero que Amazon revisa que los accesorios Sean de calidad, lamentablemente el cargador del teléfono que compré no funcionó y lo peor es que la compra no me da opción de reportarlo. Siento que para este tipo de productos Amazon debería de verificar mejor la calidad de los accesorios que mandan"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente equipó, el único pero es la vida de la Batería, llegó en un 84% de ahí ningún detalle."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular excelente en mi caso la batería llegó al 100%, muy pequeños detalles en la parte superior pero casi imperceptible lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto llegó sin problema alguno. Al abrirlo me di cuenta que está prácticamente nuevo. El cargador no es original (que te lo avisan desde la compra) pero el problema es que no es compatible el voltaje y no logra cargarlo de forma correcta, incluso podría dañarlo ya que se calentó.Si tienes un cargador nuevo de algún iPhone anterior es mejor que lo uses.Fuera de eso, es una gran compra y me quedo satisfecho."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenía mis dudas al momento de comprarlo el equipo está en un 99 de estética lo único malo fue que la batería llego al 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Happy with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Wow! Gave it thought for a couple months was a toss-up between Walmart Amazon and Best-Buy. Best-Buy apparently is a rip off and Walmart warranty wasn't as good! Bought and as stated was like new battery life is at 90% no scratches or dents and came with a new screen protector. Thought i would wait a couple months before posting a review and i,m impressed! Sure a lot cheaper at 949.00 than having bought it new a year ago! Well worth the purchase and would recommend to a friend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cable cargador no funciona"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al inicio estaba algo crédulo, muchos otros usuarios comentan el que les han llegado equipos con el 90% al 99% de batería en mi caso no fue así, si no que ah llegado con un 100% pero, toda la pantalla esta con micro rayas, al igual que los lentes de la cámara, es decir de lejos si se logra apreciar que esta muy rayad mas cuando la luz le da directamente, espero poder solucionar lo aplicando una mica, pero de lo demás me estoy muy conforme hasta ahora las fotografías no eh tenido problema pensando que también los lentes están demasiado rayados, no culpo a su anterior dueño el hecho de no ponerle algún protector al final es el gusto de cada persona y por eso baja el precio del equipo.Al final de todo, esto es como una ruleta que la suerte nos tocara un buen equipo como uno malo.Si tienen la oportunidad cómprenlo la garantía de Amazon responde muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llegó un día antes de la fecha estimada. Fue una sorpresa completamente. No podía con las ansias. Llegó con 90% de capacidad, algo menor de lo que había esperado. Trae incluido un cargador genérico, pero que funciona bien y un pincito para sacar el chip, nada más. Mica incluida, pero que tiene dos marcas circulares que no tengo idea de dónde salieron, aunque sólo se ven a contra luz.El equipo funciona bien, una funda es extremadamente necesaria porque es muy resbaloso sin una, a veces como que se tarda en agarrar la conexión celular, pero sólo es cuestión de esperar. Lentes en buenas condiciones, cámara funcional, flash funciona bien, bocinas funcionan bien, botones funcionan bien. Ya lo demás son quejas que tengo del sistema y del tamaño de pantalla, pero nada que ver con el servicio de amazon. En resumen, lo compré porque había una promoción bancaria, y estuve buscándolo varios días porque a veces costaba casi 1000 pesos menos, no sé qué factores hay para que ocurran estos cambios de precio, lo único que sé es que 18K es demasiado. La batería sí le dura, aunque no es extraordinaria, no esperaría menos del “iPhone con mejor batería”, cámara muy buena y la experiencia Apple en todo su esplendor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono en perfectas condiciones, hay un inconveniente tengo inconsistencias en la red y desafortunadamente es solo compatible con la red de AT&T si fuera compatible con todas las compañías en México estaría perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Charger is not an authentic Apple version.Was not in the original Apple box."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le doy 4 estrellas por que la pantalla vino muy muy rayada, solo de día de vez en cuando interfiere la visibilidad, de resto el celular funciona muy bien y cumple, por necesidad no lo regrese, pero si puedes no aceptes uno con rayaduras, es mejor cambiarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","llego muy rapido el equipo estaba impecable solo el auricular o bocina se escuchaba muy mal tuve que regresarlo, al igual llegando mi devolucion lo volvere a pedir espero que ahora si venga todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En buenas condiciones generales, pila al 90% un ligero raspón en la pantalla, fuera de eso bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llego bien, la pantalla un poco rallada la verdad es que no está mal aún que si esperaba un teléfono con una condición de batería mayor ya que el precio de 12 mil pues si es algo elevado, me llego con 87% de todo lo demás bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Update: the seller of this phone is truly dismal as far as warranty goes. They refused all contact, did not offer any customer support or anything to help fix my phone, not even a new screen protector! The return date has passed and I regret not returning it. It was a desperate purchase and I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. The warranty is non-existent, customer support also, non-existent. Changing to 1 starThe phone works and I REALLY needed a phone, so I kept it. It seems like the prices keep going up! But, I was under the impression that the phone was completely refurbished and ‘like new’ condition.It came with two noticeable cracks at the top of the screen, fortunately they don’t effect most of the screen and they don’t go across the camera.The battery doesn’t charge past 54% even when I use it plugged in, it just doesn’t work.It worries me a lot for how long my phone will work for the future and it’s extremely disappointing.If I had any choice I would not have kept it but my old iPhone had died and I was desperate. It had a few problems connecting but it worked and once it connected, all my pics and vids, contacts etc came back (yay!).I contacted the company, they asked for pics of all the sides of the phone (which was kind of weird) but then they never replied back.It was very disappointing and a real lapse of customer service. They definitely don’t offer any assistance with warranty or advice about what to do with product problems.It was quite the dropped ball and if you have an option for another phone, go for that one. I don’t have any confidence in how long this one will last and zero confidence in their ability to refurbish or honor their warranties."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Was hesitant to buy a refurbished iphone but except for the box and some new offbrand charging cords/ear phones, it is in perfect working order and looks/operates like it is fresh out of the store.4 out of 5 for the value because phones are too expensive across all brands.. my god.This was a solid purchase though."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buena estética."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo único “malo” sería el cargador genérico con el que viene ya que carga demasiado lento. Pero bueno, es reacondicionado, ni Apple te lo da con cargador jaja. Fuera de eso, estéticamente y funcionalmente llegó en perfectas condiciones y con una condición de batería en 91%. Todo excelente y sin ningún inconveniente, incluso hasta llegó 3 días después de realizar mi compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone me llegó sin ningún problema cosmético aparente y con batería del 93%, cargador genérico de buena calidad. Satisfecha con mi compra!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Si tuviera un poco más la vida de la batería de lo mejor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Salvo por un pequeñisimo rayón en el lado derecho el teléfono es espectacular! Tenía un iphone 6 s y ya no aguantaba jaja, el upgrade fue buenísimo, venía con cargador genérico pero carga en 2 horas y le puedo dar fácilmente 12 horas de uso continuo. La pila llegando estaba al 90%, me esperé meses para escribir esta reseña y ¡la pila sigue estando en 90%! Eso si, no lo utilizo cuando esta cargando para nada. Venía ya con protector para la parte de enfrente y de atrás, así que lo pude comenzar a utilizar sin miedo de que se rayara (solo tiene una mica delgada, pero hace el trabajo), en general muy buen producto!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una buena compra, me llegó con 94% de batería en excelentes condiciones, sin ralladuras, ni defectos. Llevo 4 meses con él y funciona correctamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho, nunca había tenido un Iphone, tenia mi desconfianza si comprarlo, pero ya después de un mes viéndolo llego en perfectas condiciones, claro trae cargador genérico no iba a llegar con el original, aunque puedes comprar el original por separado después, la pantalla está muy bien y el teléfono no tiene ningún detalle estético, solo tengan cuidado es muy ligero y resbaladizo recomiendo comprar alguna funda y mica para mayor protección."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pedí el celular a la tiende de IVECSA STORE con algo de miedo por leer que mando productos que no eran lo que pedían y en todos el problema era de paquetería de Amazon me arriesgué y lo pedí mi sorpresa fue que mi celular jamás a sido abierto esta como de fábrica ósea NO ES REACONDICIONADO, el único detalle que tiene es unos mínimos rayones en la pantalla que con la mica no se ven, estoy muy contento con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene muy bien empacando, venía con cristal templado al quitárselo tenía unos raspones en la pantalla de la parte superior derecha no afecta en nada, todo lo demás está muy bien cuidado el celular, bateria un 88%, lo he estado usando casi 14 días y va muy bien, hasta ahora nada de fallos y si busca un iPhone este es el indicador calidad precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio por un iPhone en buenas condiciones.Detalladamente agregaré lo siguiente: el teléfono fue recibido en buenas condiciones de embalaje , al abrir la caja te encuentras una caja genérica sellada , dentro el iPhone, cargador y cable , estéticamente el teléfono estaba en excelentes condiciones casi inmaculado diría yo , con algunos pequeños rayoncitos en el marco del teléfono sin embargo me lleve la sorpresa qué al retirar el cristal templado qué ya viene instalado al llegar el iPhone , con rayones muy notorios y profundos en toda la pantalla, que llegan a restar mucho a la estética general del equipo , había leído qué estos iPhone ya traían ese cristal templado instalado para precisamente cubrir esos rayones y que pasen desapercibidos, y puedo confirmar que es cierto .Batería llego en 92 % , bocinas, micrófonos y cámaras funcionando perfectamente, viene liberado , si embargo no funciona con redes Altan .Sin embargo pasados unos días, comencé a notar qué en la parte inferior trasera del teléfono apreció una pequeña abertura qué me hacia dudar si el teléfono estaba bien sellado y ante la incertidumbre de pensar que pudiera hacerse más grande decidí regresar el teléfono.En general recomendaría este teléfono si quieres un iPhone a bajo costo, sin embargo tendrás que conformarte con los pequeños detalles que pudieran aparecer con el paso del tiempo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es muy bueno el equipo, no tengo problemas con el, llevo una semana usándolo y parece estar en óptimas condiciones. Trae detalles estéticos como rayones en la pantalla y en una de las cámaras. Batería viene al 88% y creo que de ahí en fuera está bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Batería al 80%Al leer otras reseñas tenía expectativas muy altasPensé que en verdad estéticamente se vería divinoPero en la parte frontal de la pantalla arriba de la cara está como raspado o como si fuera defecto al poner de nuevo la pantallaLigeros tallones que no se ven en la orden dorada del marco por el cargadorHasta ahora me funciona bien tengo poco con el actualizo despuésSiento que me costó un poco más que si comprara uno de uso del mismo modelo por otro ladoEs mi primer iPhone desde el iPhone 4 siempre había usado Samsung, pensé que me decpcionariaPero la verdad es que está muy bien en cuanto funciones el dual sim jamás funciono no entra el chip así que lo uso como uni sim"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cargador con el que lo enviaron dejó de funcionar dos semanas después. Pero en si, el teléfono funciona muy bien y no tenía ningún detalle estético."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente calidad y precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La pantalla llegó rayada y con golpes"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 3 días con el está funcionando al 100% nomas que llego con unos pocos rayones en la pantalla, no afectan y con la batería al 87%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Quede muy satisfecho con el producto, prácticamente pareciera que es nuevo, solo tiene un muy ligero raspón en la parte superior pero causado por el case de ahí en fuera la pantalla impecable y el funcionamiento muy bueno. Tenía mis dudas de comprar por algunos comentarios, pero al final fue una buena decisión"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone que me llegó viene en excelentes condiciones lo he probado varios días y no tengo queja la batería estaba al 100% y muy bien cuidado!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No issues with the phone, battery life is as expected more high engery applications used drain the battery. On everyday things like telephone and text messages it will last all day. I'd certainly buy another phone from Amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto es Original, al principio pensé que la antena estaba dañada, después me di cuenta que estaba poniendo al revés el SIM, las condiciones del equipo son muy buenas, la batería tiene 100% de retención de carga, aunque la pantalla viene demasiado rayada y algunas muy profundas y muy notorias"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve duda de comprarlo pero al final llego con estética de 10 y con batería de 84"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I was a bit nervous to order a refurbished phone for all the obvious reasons but a 90 day return policy gave me confidence to try. The phone arrived in a plain box, well packaged. It was immaculate, no marks and battery life was good. I would consider buying another refurbished phone in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","la verdad el equipo llego en excelentes condiciones, sin ningún tipo de detalles y funcionando perfectamente.no teman a comprar productos reacondicionados, la verdad están muy bien y a un excelente precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very nice budget iPhone 11 pro max and that too with 92% battery capacity left."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tiene muchas funcionalidades y se pueden aprovechar al maximo. El diseño y colir increinle"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compré mi iPhone 11 pro max de 256 gb con un poco de temor. Evidentemente el producto es un equipo «seminuevo» o como dice el vendedor «renewed». Sin embargo, mi sorpresa fue que me llegó un teléfono en muy buenas condiciones. La batería al 93% y con una estética my buena. La pantalla vino con un cristal templado pre-instalado, que al cambiarlo por otro, me pude percatar que la pantalla tiene algunos pequeños rayones, pero nada que impida disfrutar del teléfono. Lo que si hay que decir, el cargador (cubo) es una burla, de muy mala calidad, lo único rescatable fue el cable lightning. No tuve mucho problema, por que lo cargo con el cargador de mi iPad (20w) lo que hace que funcione la carga rápida.Estoy por cumplir un mes con el equipo, si tuviera un comentario adicional, actualizo mi reseña."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me gusto mucho el color el servicio lo importante es funcional y te ahorras muchos pesos la estética me salió 9/10 que es genial por el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto venía como nuevo con 95% de batería, solo algunos raspones en el area de alrededor de las cámaras pero nada que afecte en su funcionamiento, el celular funciono con mi compañía celular y en general no tengo ningún pero, como si lo hubiera comprado nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad tenia algo de miedo leyendo algunos de los comentarios menos favorables. Pero me anime ya que vi que se podrían hacer devoluciones y que se tenia buena comunicación con el vendedor. El producto me llego en una caja x, y con un adaptador de corriente x como bien lo dicen en la publicación. El iPhone llego nuevecito y al prenderlo llego casi al 100% de batería y con la nueva actualización no me lleve ninguna sorpresa para mal.Dure además varios días esperando ya que manejan meses sin intereses pero creo debe uno estar atento para cuando los ponen ya que solo duran unos días y luego sin meses y luego vuelven."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy buen producto me llego como nuevo y tiene muy buen funcionamiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto en general viene muy bien, no dañado ni maltratado, no rasguños la capacidad de la batería es de 92% lo único malo es que la pantalla no es la original de apple; se nota en la calidad de los colores"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es un buen telefono, sin daños, la bocina se escucha muy bien, pero al recibirlo no traia cargador y menciona que si venia incluido, necesito investigar como reportarlo al proveedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone llegó en una excelente condición , estética 9/10, ligeras marcas de uso en los marcos que solamente se aprecian si observas muy de cerca.La pantalla muy bien, incluía una mica, al removerla se observan ligeras marcas de uso en la pantalla que únicamente son apreciables sin la mica y solo si observas muy de cerca y con una luz fuerte.La parte trasera y la cámara están impecables, ni un solo rayón ni una sola marca de uso.La batería llego al 96%Cómo es de esperarse llego en una caja genérica con cable y cargadores genéricos pero no es problema por que fácilmente puedes comprar los oficiales de Apple.En general muy satisfecho, es buena opción para conseguir un dispositivo de este tipo y ahorra un poco de dinero"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Batería 84%Estética solo tenía un rasguño en el marcoTodo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pues la verdad quede muy contenta con mi compra. Llego al otro día de mi pago, venía en una caja sencilla pero bien protegido, traía una mica de cristal y un proyector de plástico, traía la herramientita para abrir el porta chip, el cargador si se ve medio chafa jaja pero pues ahí decía que genérico y cumple su función, venía con la batería al 97%, si viene liberado, le puse chip Telcel en Mexico y esta todo en orden, Llevo usándolo 3 días y estoy súper contenta, me lo regale de cumpleaños. La verdad quería comprarlo por otro lado pero pues si era mucho dinero y pues temía que me robaran, entonces me decidí por Amazon ya que promete garantía de 90 días y devuelven todo el dinero, entonces por eso confié, ojalá no falle el celular, pero la verdad viene casi como nuevo, solo tiene 2 mini rasguñitos casi imperceptibles en una orilla de la pantalla, así que no creo que le pase nada."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","When I tell you don’t sit on buying this phone, I mean it!I’ve ordered with this seller before and my iPhone XS Max worked fantastic & still does!I really wanted a new phone but didn’t want to worry about contracts; this was the best way!The iPhone 11 Pro Max came in TWO days (Canada), works very well with my Canadian services as the seller had told me it would, and there is absolutely NO damage to the phone, the battery life is 100%!I LOVE IT! I highly recommend! :)It doesn’t come with a screen protector so make sure you buy some!And also order a different charger because the one they send isn’t the best!! Still very happy with it! Can’t beat the price and product!Thank you Seller!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I phone 11 pro max 256 gb, I was hesitant on buying this and had a lot of anxiety before it arrived but phone looks mint and had 96 % battery health, there was no scratches on the camera lenses or screen, not even hairline scratches.. I was suprised the phone was perfect :) now i can see why those people are thinking the 5 star reviews are fake and in my experience the phone is mint, nonproblems and I popped in my bell sim card and worked perfect.. I did a full exam on the phone and everything works like new, only regret is not getting 512 gb version because it was only $10 more but I don't think I'll need all those gigs anyway"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es una excelente opción para quien quiere un iPhone con garantía de servicio a un menor precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llegó con 87 de batería pero la verdad es que ni se nota , la batería me dura todo el día.Venía con cargador genérico pero no se ha calentado ni nada extraño."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La bocina para llamadas se escucha demasiado bajo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular venia entero, no parece reconstruido, sin abolladuras, sin raspones ni nada estético, funcionalidad al 100, sonido al 100 muy buen modelo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono es excelente su funcionamiento es Perfecto, cámaras en perfecto estado, pantalla sin ningún rasguño al igual la parte trasera impecable , la calidad es 10/10, pero le pongo 4 estrellas ya que está escrito muy claro que el teléfono viene con 90% mínimo en rendimiento de batería, y el mío llego con el 86% lo cual no me agrado mucho, de ahí en más todo Perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Bueno, pero venía algo raspado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Very happy with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Courier shipping from this seller, couldn’t be better. Phone looks new with screen plastic never been removed. No issues at all. Bought 4 totally, battery life are 87,91,96,100% respectively."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El envío fue rapidísimo, mas que en otras compras que eh realizado, el producto la verdad supero mis expectativas por mucho, muy buena compra realmente, no tenia o al menos no le note ningún detalle estético, la vida de la batería llego al 85% pero me rinde mejor que otro que tenia con vida de 90%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono me llegó con el 86% de vida útil de la batería, estéticamente esta perfecto excepto una esquina de la pantalla que tiene rayado como cuando traes el teléfono y también las llaves y se va rayando con el movimiento, eso no me gusto porque he tenido iPhone por años y nunca se me han rayado así, no afecta en su funcionamiento y todo internamente funciona bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve mis dudas antes de comprarlo, pero estoy mas que satisfecho con el estado del teléfono. Prácticamente es un equipo nuevo. Y lo que me animo al final fue el respaldo de Amazon. No será el último que compre en Renewed. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🎉"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo está súper bien, batería al 100% y la estética con un 99%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Este producto vino muy bien a la excepcion de de un detalle. Al momento de usar la camara del telefono este empieza a hacer ruido y la camara vibra. Esto no permite tomar fotos ni videos adecuadamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó en tiempo y forma, aunque no llega en su caja original ni con cargador o cable originales, estéticamente llegó 9/10, si esperas un teléfono “nuevo” pues esta no es tu opción jaja, puedo destacar que llegó con un pequeño rayón en la pantalla, pero de ahí en fuera el teléfono esta como nuevo, batería al 90% y hasta ahora estoy feliz con la compra, vale la pena por el teléfono que es, igual y se tiene bastante tiempo para devolverlo, es arriesgarse pero pues a mí se me hizo buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es mi primera compra en Amazon Renewed, BuySpry sigan vendiendo iphones en este estado y volveré a comprar con ustedes. Mi iphone 11 pro máx llegó en excelente estado físico y operativo pila al 91% llevo un día con el y al momento no ha fallado, espero siga así. Productos con excelente estética y funcionamiento correcto no tienen porque ser devueltos. El vendedor resuelve muy rápido los cuestionamientos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Envía mis dudas Pero el equipo está en muy buen estado, funciona todo al 100% y la batería al 95%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Pondría 5 estrellas pero la pantalla traía unas ligeras rayas. Lo bueno es que ya con la mica de hidrogel mate no se notan. Estuve a punto de devolverlo pero finalmente me lo quedé y funciona bien. Solo eso, las rayas en la pantalla."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En general esta en buen estado, 85% de batería al llegar, funciona bien pero al poco tiempo comenzó a trabarse, a tener pequeñas fallas que se presentaron cada vez de forma más frecuente. No me gustó, no valió la pena la compra, solo si te gustan mucho y no quieres pagar por uno nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llegó en perfecto estado, batería al 100% ningún rayón o golpe es como si fuera nuevo, recomiendo totalmente al vendedor ivecsa store ; anteriormente había comprado uno de buyspry en color plata pero llego rayado del marco y con una abolladura cerca de la cámara que le dejó una marca como “burbuja” en el cristal , ese mismo día pedí la devolución."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Three months ago, I bought this white iPhone 11 Pro Max, when I got it, I felt so excited, it was like brand new, no scratch, battery life was 97%, so great! I love it so much! But after 3 months later, now the battery life is only 88%, it dropped down so fast, not usual. I asked my friend, she bought iPhone 12 last year, Black Friday, until now, still 100% battery life, so jealous of her. Anyway, I love iPhone, but this made me disappointed. Maybe I was bad luck. :("
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I'm very happy with this phone so far, mine came with no scratches, battery at 97%, a screen and lens film protectors already installed. The charger was not Apple, but I'm using one I had from an older iPhone. From all the sellers, I picked one here in Canada with overnight shipping -- this one came from ""Westend Enterprises Inc"", and fullfilled by Amazon. I didn't want to take any chances with those shipped from the States."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenía mis dudas por ser un equipo reacondicionado, llegó justo a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones.Como nuevo ya con mica en la pantalla, cargador y cable.Recomiendo mucho comprar en BUYSPRY"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","2 meses funcionando a la perfección bateria al 100% estética 10/10 no le encontré defecto.He tenido buena experiencia con los celulares Reacondicionados. Lo recomiendo!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en excelentes condiciones, tenia dudas sobre todo con la pila porque habia comentarios buenos y algunos malos, pero esta muy bonito traia una estetica de 9.9 la pila estaba al 100, llego en caja que generica con cargador igual, pero lo uso con otro que ya tenia y esta muy bien la carga le dura mucho mas que al SE 2020 definitivamente lo volveria a comprar solo hay que revisar el vendedor, se anuncian muchos pero no todos tienen buenos comentarios algunos ni siquiera los envian."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Teléfono de muy baja calidad, básicamente diré que es una porquería, para lo que cuesta hay mejor opción! Esta súper reacondicionado y tiene piezas genéricas (piratas)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Traía unos golpes en las esquinas, nada que afecte el funcionamiento, con la funda no se ve prácticamente nada, la pantalla ya traía puesta una mica, el proceso de activación fue muy fácil y rápido, el equipo funciona bastante bien, la pantalla muy bien, las fotos excelentes, no tengo queja, la batería llego con un 97% de vida."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo está como nuevo, su estética podría decirse perfecta; batería al 96% y hasta el momento funciona muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono lo compre hace un par de días por que me anime a cambiarme a iPhone y quería algo ""nuevo"" el teléfono venia con una mica cristal impecable al igual que la pantalla y la parte trasera del teléfono pero la parte de los lados parecía que se la habían metido por el culo al anterior dueño estaba muy rayado hasta al punto en que pensé que le habían pasado una lija y seamos honestos obvio que por el precio vale la versión del teléfono pero no creo que valga la pena pagar 17k o 15k para que este tan rayado y parezca que lo arrastraron por el piso, se que me dirán que mientras el dispositivo sirva no importa lo demás pero si en algún momento lo quieres vender eso le bajara valor al producto por que ya esta rayado al igual que la batería no venia tan mal contaba con 89% de uso :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta reseña la escribo despues de un tiempo de uso, el equipo llegó bien sin rayones aparentes con mica, retire la mica y tenía rayones de uso, esto personalmente no me molestó lo que si no me gusto y terminó en devolución fue la degradación rápida de la batería, me llego con un 98% y en menos de un mes se fue a 96, luego 94 y en dos meses y medio tenía 90% hice la calibración y quedo en el mismo porcentaje además de ser notorio al uso, nunca lo usé mientras se cargaba y usaba un cargador apple que yo tengo que no es carga rápida (he tenido y tengo productos apple) asi que no le di mal usl que el normal sin jugar juegos pesados (jamás se calentó) supongo salió mal la pila... No creo que sea asi en todos los renovados así que si los recomiendo pero chequenlos muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I ordered this phone last week because my old iPhone 6S was on its way out. It arrived on Sunday, and I was worried that it wasn’t going to be as advertised. When I opened the box and saw the phone, I was pleasantly surprised! It’s in nearly perfect condition, with very few unnoticeable scratches at the top. The battery health is at 100% and it lasts a long time without needing a charge. I cannot express how thrilled I am with this purchase, and I am very happy that I decided to buy it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Got mine today, product is brand new, was wrapped, came with charger etc... Did not come in original box, but who cares. The only issue is that when I insert the SIM card the carrier is detected but not active, try resetting network settings, SIM port looks very clean and tried with 2 SIM cards with 2 different Canadian carriers. I think the phone is still locked with the previous carrier (my opinion) I have sent an email to the seller and awaiting an answer. This is my reason for 2 stars cause product is not working as expected. But will change depending on resolutions."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre este teléfono para mi uso diario y quede muy contento, ya era la segunda vez que compro así un dispositivo y realmente me a encantado como llega el dispositivo, sin rayones, la pantalla en perfecta condición, su batería con una alto porcentaje de vida aún, muy contento la verdad. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo en batería tiene una integridad del 100%, la carcasa está en perfectas condiciones sin el mínimo rayón o golpe, pero la pantalla sí se encontraba con muchos rayones ocasionados por llaves o herramientas, inclusive uno de ellos está profundo justo en la posición del lente en la cámara frontal. En ciertos ángulos la luz se ve un mínimo reflejada por el rayón. No afecta su funcionamiento y con una mica de cristal o hidrogel se cubren los rayones. El cargador y cable son genéricos y la caja a su vez es genérica de buena calidad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego en súper buenas condiciones, sin ningún detalle y la batería arriba del 90%. Súper satisfecho con mi compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me la rifé leyendo varios comentarios que unos equipos no jalaban bien o despues de unos dias no tenia señal pero la verdad el que me mandaron esta casi nuevo. Y tiene 100% de vida la pila. Tengo casi 2 semanas de usarlo y asta ahorita jala bien. Solo un dia que sali si tenia señal pero no entravan ni salian llamadas ni datos. Pero solo me meti ala pagina d mitelcel(tengo telcel) y lo registre como decia un papelito que venia con el cell. Nose si fue por eso o de plano se callo la red por un momento. típico Telcel siemple que se batala cuando llueve o esta bien nublado. Ensi no se si pueda recomendarlo tomando encuenta los otros compradores y no todos los “renewed” estan identicos. Aveses asta los nuevos salen fallando de la fabrica pero lo bueno que ai siempre te daran otro nuevo. Aqui te ariesgas ala condicion que lo maden. 😅Lo bueno que tienen un mes si no vale la pena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llego en caja genérica y cargador genérico funcional, la capacidad de batería llego en 86% , detalles estéticos casi nulos, la bocina se escucha un poco mal, distorsionada en volumen algo, si sale otro detalle me plantearé el devolverlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No llevo los 3 meses y se prende y se apaga, me podrían apoyar en cómo podría hacer el cambio o reembolso? Por favor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Equipo en perfecto estado, me encanto.Cargador de buena vista, cable de 3 pies, buenos acabados.Condición de batería 90%, estaré probando cuánto es la durabilidad dentro del periodo de garantía.El paquete llegó antes de lo acordado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Impressed ❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone was perfect except I couldn’t hear anyone when they called or when they called me"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo un mes con el equipo llego bien una buena estética , batería del 86% hasta el momento sin fallas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, el Face ID falló como a los 2 meses pero todo en orden"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Phone would constantly cut internet and phone calls. Brought it in and was told that antenna was probably damaged. I returned it with no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Todo bien, unos poquitos rayones en los costados pero nada de gravedad, en general está en buen estado, todo funciona perfecto, con 86% de batería, para el precio que pague lo vale, estoy satisfecho"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max"," Todo bien, unos poquitos rayones en los costados pero nada de gravedad, en general está en buen estado, todo funciona perfecto, con 86% de batería, para el precio que pague lo vale, estoy satisfecho"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo he usado ya por un mes, esta en excelentes condiciones, llego con 91% de bateria, es suerte, pedi otros dos y llegaron con 86 y 81, los devolvi y al tercero llego otro del 90%, es cuestion de arriesgarse pero todo excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relación CALIDAD PRECIO es aceptable , la batería está al 90% ( llegó con el 91 hace un mes ) , pero siendo un iPhone ya es conocido que así es la cosa , tengo que mencionar que me lleve un susto cuando quise al empezar a respaldar el celular a este nuevo ME APARECÍA EL ANTERIOR DUEÑO DEL APARATO , yo creí que estaba totalmente borrado , o su no se si sea parte del funcionamiento , la cosa es que hoy mi celular está funcionando AL 100% en todas sus cosas sin nada raro , ( que bueno todos los iPhones que he tenido siempre tienen repentinamente algún completamiento extraño por algún momento ) que le atribuyo al IOS de Apple ... LO RECOMIENDO , por cierto todo en tiempo y forma .👍🏼"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 mes con el desde septiembre , Llegó en buenas condiciones, como nuevo estéticamente solo la batería llegó en 89% y en 1 mes bajó a 86% pero creo que es por el cargador se tiene que comprar el original, todo lo demás va bien, todas las piezas que tiene son originales"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estetica de 10, pero al probarlo unos dias, no tarda nada , tiene 82% de batera, ya tiene 12 dias que lo devolví y no me dan mi reembolso, pesimo servicio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo funciona y opera correctamente conforme a especificaciones del fabricante. Sin embargo, aunque se especifica claramente su condición de reacondicionado, el equipo llegó con una mica de cristal pegada a la pantalla, con lo cual se minimiza unas muy leves ralladuras. A lo mejor valdría la pena publicar imágenes de los productos reales para los casos de reacondicionados, en vez de imágenes de catálogo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo regrese porque no cumplía con los estándares que comenta la publicación. Mala calidad, no parece nuevo y el estado de la batería estaba en 79%. Realice la devolución y el comprador muy buena atención me hicieron el reembolso cuando revieron mi artículo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","muy buenas condiciones , bateria al 89% sin raspones ni nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Producto tal cual dice la descripción"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llegó un iPhone original en muy buen estado el único detalle fue la pantalla que estaba muy rayada pero con la mica ya no se le ven las marcas hasta ahora todo bien y la batería llego al 88 porciento"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","First week i was super happy with my phone. But now its been two months or so, and i have realized a bunch of flaws which you guys should be aware of

Firstly, my phones actual screen isn’t authentic. Its very obviously third party. Has a weird feel, doesnt operate as smoothly as an original would

Second of all, the battery is third party as well. Iphones are advertised as fast charge, up to 50% charge within first 30 mins. I spent 50-100$ on a fast charge cable and charging block from Anker. The phone charges superrrr slow. Takes well over an hour to even reach 50% charge.

And i have to constantly turn phone on airplane mode, and turn it back off. Because the phones internet/services stop working multiple times per day. Ive had 5+ iphones in my life, never ever encountered this before.

There are other things too but i dont wana make this review an essay. I highly do not recommend buying from this supplier. Truly disappointed with the product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo se encuentra como nuevo, pero obvio no lo es…
Relación costo calidad de 9/10, definitivamente es la mejor opción para compra segura y con garantía. Estética 10/10 y batería al 86%.
Accesorios genéricos y caja genérica."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compre el equipo y todo iba perfecto hasta que me di cuenta que se calentaba, a veces lo hacía cuando veía Facebook o instagram, pasaba en momentos completamente aleatorios. A veces se calentaba demasiado y solo se enfríaba hasta que lo apagaba, sin duda tuve que devolverlo por miedo a que la batería empeorará muy rápido por esto mismo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenia mis dudas de comprar un producto usado, mas al hablar de algo como un iPhone, pero el celular me llego en tres días, prácticamente esta nuevo, no tiene ningún defecto , la batería al 100%.
Creo que realize una excelente compra puesto que al compara el precio de uno nuevo con este usado hay mucha diferencia y en lo que respecta a calidad y estética en el usado, prácticamente ninguna. Volvería a comprar."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En realidad, más que venderte un producto renovado por algún detalle, lo que te venden es un producto de segunda mano. En mi caso, el equipo incluso viene con una mica protectora y en los bordes se nota algo de suciedad, es decir, ni siquiera lo limpiaron. Por otro lado, la vida útil de la batería es de un 85% (vida útil promedio de los equipos que amigos o conocidos tienen actualmente y que adquirieron cuando el producto salió al mercado)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Está como nuevo y funciona perfecto, sin golpes ni rayones. El único detalle que yo mencionaría es que la condición de la batería está al 85%, yo esperaba al menos arriba de 90%, pero bueno la descripción del producto lo advierte."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llegó bien, tal cual dice la publicación, equipo seminuevo, vida de la batería 82%, equipo con Mica en la pantalla, cargador y usb genérico, y todo funcionando a la perfección"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llegó con estética de 10 y 97 en la batería.
Apenas llevo 4 días de uso y todo perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me llego a tiempo, todo bien hasta ahorita y la batería me llego a 86 para el precio eso no me agrada tanto:/"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me encantó todo, parece nuevo, no tiene ningún detalle, la batería al 100% solo por el cargador y la caja que no son originales, pero el equipo sin duda una maravilla, la mejor compra que pude haber hecho, gracias al vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, solo que no mencionaron que tenía una falla en el Face ID, sabía que no compraba un celular nuevo, pero una herramienta así ese esencial en el teléfono hay que mencionarlas, por lo demás quedo satisfecho."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tallado en la esquina Con ligeros detalles exteriores calificación 8 de 10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","bateria al 88% todo lo demas perfecto como nuevo, si problemas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Fue mi primera experiencia comprando renewed y mi iPhone llegó impecable! Obvio no llegó en su caja original ni accesorios originales pero el teléfono llegó con el 100% de batería y hasta con mica para la pantalla. Lo único que me quedó ligeramente insatisfecho es que el cable que venía no tiene información que corrobore que es MFI pero fuera de eso, llega empaquetado super bien. Si le vuelvo a comprar a Buyspry!
Cabe resaltar que lo compré por Abril y para Octubre sigue totalmente funcional."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es la 2da vez que lo pido, la primera venia con 83%de batería y lo devolví, este vino como nuevo,.y 90% de batería, lo recomiendo de verdad excelente opción"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cel está es buenas condiciones estéticas, funciona muy bien, viene con cargador genérico, la batería tiene muy buen estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Compré este celular el 23 de Junio del 2021
Hago este comentario el 19 de Septiembre casi 3 meses de usarlo, hasta el momento todo muy bien, sin ningún detalle grave de uso o daño, solo trae dos ralloncitos en la pantalla, nada que disguste.
Definí no viene con cargador, ni caja original pero la verdad que no pasa nada, el cargador funciona mucho más rápido que el de mi iPad. Así que te evitas gastarte más dinero por un original.
Hasta el momento pienso que fue una muy buena compra.
Saludos!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es lo que esperaba segun la descripcion del producto, tenia una caja generica, bien empacado, cargador (5W) y cable genericos, no incluye audifonos, tegngo usandolo dos semanas y todo bien hasta ahora, ya actualice a 14.5, la pantalla y la parte de atras bien, unas rayas y golpes en las esquinas. Bocina, entradas y camara bien, la maxima capacidad de la bateria estaba en 94%, ahora es 93, solo me decepciono la bateria (por eso las 4 estrellas), en general lo recomendaria."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","muy bueno solo raspones en lo laterales y el cargador es de muy mala calidad, debería integra uno certificado"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llega en condiciones buenas, la condición de la batería llegó al 92% lo único malo es el cargador dice que es el que debe de llevar pero se ve de muy mala cálida al igual que el cable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","I must say that in the beginning I was worried to buy it, once I received it everything was working like if it’s brand new and I must say WOW. I highly recommend it if you need a new phone!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen equipo pero no viene 3n su empaque original y no tiene el cargador original."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto ! Me llego con un 97% de vida de batería ahora tengo 94 dos meses después. Pero en lo funcional 10/10 muy bonito como nuevo! Si buscas un teléfono por un precio razonable es tu opción. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llego súper bien solo con un par de rayones en la pantalla pero nada de que preocuparse, por todo lo demás esta muy bien, la pila está al 91%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","99% de batería, componentes originales, totalmente impecable, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llevo 1 día usándolo, hasta el momento llegó bien, no tiene ningún detalle, más que unos cuantos rayones en la pantalla, si eres muy exigente, no te lo recomiendo, pero si puedes pasar de unos rayoncitos, es perfecto, 100% recomendado
La batería llego con el 88%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","93% de condición de batería. Ninguna falla."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Porque no se aseguran del correcto funcionamiento de estos equipos renewed? es el segundo que recibo con la misma falla, el primero de plano no se escuchaba y en este caso se escucha muy bajito, obligando a abrir el altavoz para sostener una llamada telefonica, evidentemente esto no siempre es posible.
Necesito que me lo cambien por uno que funcione correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien, con pequeñas marcas de uso, pero nada exagerado..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La relación entre calidad y precio es muy buena, pero debo admitir que el cargador con el que viene el teléfono, es genérico y no tiene audífonos, entonces si hacemos la suma de esos dos artículos es de aproximadamente 3 mil pesos que tienes que agregar al valor final del equipo. Just for your information."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo compre hace poco pero hasta hoy todo perfectos, se calienta un poco al cargar pero supongo es normal, estética 10, cámaras 10, todo va muy bien me gusta mucho . Espero siga así"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Not a single scratch or blemish on the device, product took about 4-5 days coming from Texas to Ontario. Battery life was 87%. Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","the phone is like new, no scratches, the battery condition is 94%, the camera works great, no bugs and takes great photos, the picture quality is good, the sound is good , the storage capacity is 256 GB as I had chosen and the iPhone is official I am happy with my purchase, the only disappointment is to pay $ 1100 and receive a 5W charger and not an 18W charger for fast charging. I recommend this product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo bien buen servicio del cliente quien atendió amablemente una solicitud"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente 91% de batería sin rayones En pantalla ni en ninguna parte, estoy esperando únicamente la factura y fuera de que el cargador no es original estoy totalmente encantado con que el dispositivo llegara en tan buenas condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El precio sigue siendo alto para ser un equipo que se le han cambiado piezas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo esta super bien, funciona perfectamente sin problemas, sin estrellados todo muy bien. Lo unico que deberian tener en cuenta es la pila a mi me vino con el 88% pero me ha estado durando la pila y dia completo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono venía con 87% de batería y estética de 10 no tenía rayones solo que lo envían en caja genérica y cargadores genéricos mi compra fue con clevermex recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llegó en caja genérica con un cargador de otra marca pero con el plus que es de carga rápida, (cargador que Apple no te dá cuando compras el teléfono por cierto). El teléfono está prácticamente nuevo con la vida de batería al 100%. Supongo que es suerte porque éste celular llegó impecable pero también compré un iPhone xs plata y ese celular llegó desgastado de los costados, rayas mínimas en la pantalla y batería al 81%. No sé de que dependa..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Muy bueno como nuevo solo que enviaron cargador viejo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","will definitely buy again from your guys! 1100 cad plus tax for iPhone 11 Pro Max 512gb! That’s amazing! And the battery life is 100%! Not sure how but that’s so great! Also it looks like a completely new phone no scratch no dents at all and it comes with a screen protector! Thanks you guys!! Appreciate it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Venía un poco rayado pero lo disimulan con una mica y se calentaba, pero al actualizarlo se compuso el sobrecalentamiento, y las rayaduras eran detalles mínimos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente producto me llegó en menos de 2 dias, estetica 9.8 ya que la bateria contaba con 87%, pequeños rayones pero nada de que preocuparse. La verdad es muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se encuentra como si fuera nuevo, no unico es que a mi llego con 86% de pila y el cable y el cubo es genérico, pero en lo demas aspectos lo Recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Hasta ahorita me funciona excelentemente bien la bateria me dura 2 dias. Mi pregunta es si es resistente al agua."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Had some problems with the phone,
First off; the screen protector was cracked when received - I was shocked and thought the screen itself was broken
but I think its only the protector thats cracked.
Second off; the phone did not register to the service provider for a bit
I had to call them to ""activate"" the phone to get it to turn on LTE and stuff otherwise its ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Recién tengo una semana con equipo, hasta ahora todo bien. Me había quedado bastante atrás, tenía un Iphone 6s plus y un 8 Plus, así que estoy contenta con el cambio. Considerando que sólo me interesan funciones básicas de redes sociales y fotos, estoy satisfecha con la compra. La batería llegó con una capacidad máxima al 96% lo cual está muy razonable por el precio. Actualizo comentarios en un par de meses."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tuve una grata experiencia con el dispositivo completamente original y con todas las funciones al 100%, y con muy buen porcentaje de vida de batería, sin rayones de pantalla ni camaras,lo recomiendo ampliamente como nuevo"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Está perfecto, funciona como nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En la mica que trae tapa mucho de los rayones que trae la pantalla, lo cambiaria pero serán muchos problemas para la información que ya le metí al teléfono, hay que cuidar más la estética de las pantallas de estos teléfonos, por qué si bien son usados deben de manejar calidad en los mismos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Apenas llevo una semana de uso, pero el teléfono como nuevo totalmente, tanto física como funcionalmente. Lo recomiendo mucho, llegó con 100% de pila, sin ningún detalle físico y liberado para cualquier compañía (yo uso Telcel) tiene Apple care vigente de un mes a partir de la entrega (al menos así fue en mi caso)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The phone came dead but that’s okay I just charged it and it was fine, I love it, the screen protector it came with was dirty but that’s fine. Overall i recommend"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego en tiempo y forma!! Se ve mono!! Obvio es renewed no esperes q la estética sea de 10 pero si alcanza el 9 pantalla y parte posterior 10 sin rayones la orilla obvio es la que tiene pekeños detallitos pero todo perfecto!! La verdad contenta funciona al 100Tenía un 11 pro normal pero quería la pantalla más grande!

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo excelente me llego con un 89% de batería sin ningún rayón le quite la mica que trae puesta para ver si trae arañazos la pantalla traía una pero no se ve al ponerle el cristal templado y sin el cristal tienes que buscarla bien al reflejo de la Luz para que se note lo recomiendo totalmente llego con cargador y caja genérica que al final del día eso no me preocupa debido a que lo cargo con su cargador original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular luce como nuevo! Llegó perfectamente empacado. Estoy muy contenta con mi compra.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Great phone, works well, easy set up"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The motherboard went capput on my iPhone X. So I order This 11 pro max. It has exceeded my expectations. I am so very impressed with the functionality of this item. Very well packaged and like opening NEW. Trust seller 100 %.Thank YOU."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Le téléphone étais en un état neuf"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En perfectas condiciones estéticas y funcionales. Estado de batería en 91%. Venía con cable y cargador (genéricos) que funcionan muy bien. Llevo 1 semana con el teléfono, hasta ahora todo ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Me encantó de principio a fin!!! No puedo creer que aunque sea renovado tenga la batería al 100% y con ningún detalle estético, incluso viene con una mica y nunca se ha abierto porque todavía tiene el sello contra el agua (verificado con el barometro) y todas sus piezas obviamente son originales (verificado con un programa, la batería solo tenka 30 ciclos) por muchísimo menos dinero de lo que cuesta, es de verdad increíble"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","llevo una semana utilizando, todo bien hasta ahora, la batería llego con condiciones al 100%, sin detalles, ni rayones. trajo cable y cargador."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto está perfecto, aunque la primera vez que lo pedí me enviaron unas toallitas húmedas y tuve que pedir mi reembolso, la atención al cliente por parte de Amazon es perfecta. Lo volví a comprar y por fin llegó el producto que pedí. El teléfono venía con 93 de batería pero espero que con las semanas de uso se calibre y aumente. La estética es impecable en mi caso y todo funcionando en orden. Súper recomendado, pero para que hagas la compra rastrea el precio más bajo y se paciente!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","EL celular estaba totalmente bloqueado como si fuera nuevo, venía con accesorios genéricos como lo dice la descripción, estéticamente tiene un 8 de 10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Se entiende que sea un producto reacondicionado y no es totalmente nuevo, pero al menos en mi caso, me llegó con una pantalla con bastantes rayones pequeños (el anterior dueño seguro lo dejaba con la pantalla en el suelo) y en la descripción dice que no deberían ser prácticamente nulos o nulos. Lo que no me gustó es que tratan de ocultarlo poniéndole una mica protectora para que parezca que no tiene rayones, y es algo engañoso.
No es mal producto pero en mi opinión les recomiendo que si lo compran, le quiten esa mica para ver las condiciones reales en las que lo envían."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio tenía miedo de que el producto no llegara, por casos que han ocurrido, o que el producto fuera malo hasta que no fuera original, pero todo excelente, el equipo parece nuevo, sin fallas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con un golpe en el marco metálico que le dejo una marca como tipo burbuja cerca de la cámara además de varios rayones profundos , traía una mica de cristal mal colocada, por el precio y en ese estado no lo valía"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Yo he cambiado mi dirreccion muchas veces cuando pide este iPhone, pero era entregado al mi vieja direction y me hace muchas problemas. Se decir que el servicio de Amazon tiene problemas. El iPhone es excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me pareció bien producto, me llegó con 87 y tenía un uso medio lo normal y aguantaba el día y si me pasaba lo cargaba"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","POR LA RELACION PRECIO CALIDAD LE DOY UN 10, LLEVO MAS DE 4 MESES USANDOLO Y FUNCIONA A LA PERFECCION Y SIN DETALLES. SOLO QUE SI LLEGÓ CON DETALLES ESTETICOS PERO NADA QUE CON LAS FUNDAS QUE SIEMPRE SE LE PONEN SEA CUBIERTO. TRAÍA UN GOLPE EN UNA ESQUINA Y UNOS RAYONES LEVES."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Buen producto parece nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó en tiempo y forma. Esta como nuevo en cuestión de estética y funcionamiento."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente cómpra me llegó hoy al 91% de vida y Literal parece nuevo espero y no tenga problemas más adelante me encantó"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo bien! Venia un tanto rayado cosa que no se notifica, pero fuera de eso no tiene inconveniente o problema, con el ahorro que tuve sinceramente estoy satisfecha. Llevo ya un tiempo con el teléfono y no tengo ningún problema, a excepción de los rayones! El teléfono es lo máximo como todos los productos de apple"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone viene con batería al 91% sin rayones ni golpes, definitivamente excelente compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Por lo menos a mí, mi dispositivo llegó con un rallón profundo y porcentaje de bateria en 88%.
Cuando me contacte para devolverlo porque no quería tenerlo así, sólo me ofrecieron 10 USD como compensación"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Mi celular llego muy rayado y con solo el 80% en la vida de batería. Estoy pensando en regresarlo, aunque el sistema ha servido bien, la estética es como de 6. Si es arriesgarse. La calidad precio no es equiparable, se trata de suerte."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Sin rasguños, del color y capacidad elegido, estéticamente como nuevo, sin golpes ni ralladuras, la batería 86%, sin caja, llega cargador y cable genérico, pero por el precio, muy recomendable, me llegó en 2 semanas o poco menos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo llego practicamente nuevo, muy buena compra.
Solo la pila me hubiera gustado que llegara como el anterior arriba de 92%, este llego en 85%.

Pero todo excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo me llegó dañado , la cámara no funciona correctamente estéticamente es un 8 pero al ser reacondicionado es entendible"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","me llego con calidad de 9 por que solo tenia unos mínimos raspones en las orillas, la pila llego con 85 asi que me parece muy bien, llevo 4 días probandolo y no me arrepiento de la compra la bateria me dura todo el dia excelente!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Perfect size"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono llegó en perfectas condiciones, estéticamente 10/10, y en cuanto al funcionamiento todo muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Sinceramente esperaba menos y me sorprendió 512 GB en perfecto estado jalando perfecto, batería al 97% todo funcionando a la perfección, cámaras correctas todo excelente ! Cable y centro de carga genérico pero por el precio ahorrarse esos lujos y compensarlo con 512 GB me parece excelente !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llego con 87 % de batería nada mal y solo unas rallas en la pantalla con la mica no s nota nada por el precio esta bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El cargador con el que venia solo funcionó 1 mes , y dejo de servir tu e que comprar otro , creo que deberían revisar muy bien los componentes adicionales. El teléfono si lleno todas mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estética de 100, como nuevo, recomendable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Todo perfecto unas ligeras marcas de uso en la zona de cámaras pero estética de 9.5 diría, me llego con 100% de vida de batería, tendré que devolverlo porque mi banco no me respeto la promoción de reembolso en estado de cuenta :( es una lástima pero si lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tenía mis dudas al ser un producto
Amazon renewed pero me arriesgué y fue una buena decisión, llegó en excelentes condiciones
Muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La estética de 9.5 bastante buena condición el producto, la batería superó por completo mis expectativas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es un equipo usado por lo que la batería no llega al 100, pero fuera de eso funciona de maravilla, físicamente casi no tiene ningún detalle, la caja, el cable y el cargador son genéricos pero por el precio está muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al principio el teléfono llegó con rayones es normal por que es renewed y pues es obvio que alguien más lo uso, pero al mes justamente ayer ya no jalo el Face ID y le salió una raya verde a la pantalla y se apaga y se prende la pantalla cuando quiere lo bueno que alcance a tramitar el reembolso ya que Amazon te da 90 días de garantía. Espero que los demás si les haya salido muy bien su equipo solo es mi caso en particular."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","EL telefono esta excelente como si fuera nuevo no se nota la diferencia, y tiene el 92 porciento de rendimiento en la bateria."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Me sorprende lo bien conservado que me llego, hasta el momento sin ningun detalle. Lo único malo es el cargador y cable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Al ser un producto re manufacturado estaba consiente de que tendría algunos desgastes o defectos.

Desgraciadamente al destaparlo me lleve la desagradable sorpresa de que estaba bastante rayada de la pantalla y traía varios golpes en las orillas del marco metálico así como en las cámaras.

Los rayones estaban demasiado profundos.

Desgraciadamente estuve fuera de mi domicilio por trabajo bastante tiempo.
Por lo que al regresar y revisar el
Producto perdí el tiempo de devolución.

Termine gastando más en cambiar el Glass dañado del teléfono.

La condición de la batería llegó al 87% y a la fecha se ha mantenido.

Personalmente no vuelvo a comprar renovado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Es buen producto solo que algunas aplicaciones primordiales como whatsaop se atoran y tardan para abrir"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo uso para todo, lo mejor es que pude acomodar una línea de att en forma de chip virtual, y otra de telcel en el chip físico, y ya no requiero dos aparatos. Realmente estoy muy contento con el equipo, excelentes fotos y videos también"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Después de 15 días de uso continuo funciona como un producto nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La pantalla estaba muy rallada, estos rayones afectaban la cámara frontal y la duración de la batería era muy mala"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Físicamente llegó en excelentes condiciones, sin un sólo rayón. Funcionamiento perfecto. Está cómo nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El único detalle que tiene en contra es una batería con 85% de vida, por lo demás, gran teléfono"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto está en muy buen estado, sin ningún rayón o golpe, está en una condición de 10 y la batería me llego con 99% , aunque no todo fue del todo bien ya que días antes había pedido el color space gray y me perdieron el paquete, aunque eso ya fue cuestión de la paquetería pero en cuanto al teléfono tenía mis dudas por comentarios que leí y la verdad es que no me arrepiento, hasta ahora todo funcionando bien y a la perfección"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El equipo me llegó en estado impecable.
Se ve como nuevo, no tiene detalles estéticos.
Funciona perfectamente. Me llegó con 98% de vida útil de batería. Recomendado al 100."

Gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esta muy bien!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Uno tiene sus reservas cuando hace este tipo de compras, sin embargo cada vez los proveedores van mejorando y ése es el chiste que cada vez vayan dando más confianza.

En pocas palabras perfecto."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El dispositivo llegó como nuevo con una batería al 89%, solo pueden apreciarse algunos pequeños rasguños en la pantalla cerca de la cámara, sin embargo, fuera de ese detalle parece un teléfono nuevo, el cargador es genérico y la verdad no me dio mucha confianza, preferí utilizar el que ya tenía."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","The battery is less than 90%. The phone is overpriced. It’s available on Swappa for much less."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Estoy muy contento con la compra, el celular llego en excelentes condiciones, ya han pasado los días desde que lo compre y estoy 100% satisfecho. Debo decir que cuando me llegó , no estaba muy contento porque no venía en su caja original ni sus accesorios, ya que el abrir un iphone en su empaque también es una experiencia genial. Fuera de eso sin problemas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad estuve dudosa en si me convenía cómpralo, pero quedé gratamente sorprendido, no tiene ningún detalle de estética, el funcionamiento es perfecto, la batería viene al 100%Sin duda ha sido una compra muy buena.Además que cuentan con meses sin intereses y llego antes de lo que esperaba."

 Espero sólo haya sido mala suerte. El iPhone estaba impecable incluso traía una mica para la pantalla y con 94% de condición. Lo configure y use por una semana. Había tenido un poco de problema con la señal de Telcel pero se solucionó sólo (quien sabe cómo). El problema fue que una semana después la pantalla se puso verde, después se quitó y sentí alivio, pero volvió a ponerse en verde y así estuvo iba y venía el verde. Me había gustado mucho pero tuve que devolverlo. Afortunadamente pude borrar mis datos. Estoy en espera del reembolso. He comprado otros y nunca me había pasado esto de la pantalla verde."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","La verdad era lo que esperaba, excedió mi expectativa ya que llego 2 dias antes de lo programado, me llamo la atención que el celular ya venia hasta con protector de vidrio templado, claro que volvería a comprar, sabiendo que son productos buenos y sobretodo garantizados , si te ahorras unos cuantos miles de pesos en Mexico respecto a su valor NUEVO."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Tengo dos semanas utilizándolo. Llegó en otro empaque pero eso es lo de menos, ya que hasta el momento ha funcionado de maravilla y hasta me llegó con la mica protectora de pantalla como extra, siendo que cuestan muy caras. Sin duda volvería a comprar productos reacondicionados en Amazon. Totalmente una compra 100% ecológica. No me arrepiento de la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El iPhone SE calienta mucho al usarlo y llega con una mica de vidrio, se la quite para ponerle una mica mate y cual fue mi sorpresa “LA PANTALLA RAYADA Y TALLADA” tiene muchos rayones y talones, le ponen la mica para disimular su estado. Estoy por devolverlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","phone didn't work right was told to return it and I did want a refund"

No incluye cargador ni caja original, pero por el costo y la promoción de MSI lo vale!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Una verdadera lastima a la hora de abrir el paquete, siempre estás con la ilusión de estrenar un equipo ya sea nuevo o usado pero la ilusión se volvió frustración al ver que solo venían instrucciones del equipo reacondicionado y un cargador generico, creo que es una falta grave de respeto hacer ese tipo de cosas y no los justifico de ningún modo, lo único bueno de todo esto fue que si me hicieron el reembolso, 20 días después de la compra y yo sin celular y sin dinero por esos largos 20 días de angustia, espero y les sirva este comentario y a ustedes no les pase lo mismo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Excelente relación calidad precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El producto venía sin detalles estéticos, funcionando de manera óptima, incluyendo el face id y con pila del 89%. Sin embargo al actualizar a iOS 15 detectó que la pantalla no era la original. Siendo está una pantalla que incluso no era OLED."

Lo único que no me gusto fueron los cargadores ya que en el anuncio salía con los cargadores originales."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular me llego con las cámaras rayadas, pantalla rayada y lo peor con las bocinas tapadas con mugre, tanta mugre que no se escucha nada cuando hablo por teléfono. Esperaba más de los estándares de calidad de Amazon."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El teléfono venía en muy buenas condiciones, solo rayones minúsculos en la pantalla, el resto del teléfono estaba como nuevo.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Viene como se indica, el iPhone en excelentes condiciones, con las especificaciones establecidas, la vida de la batería al 100. El cable y cargador es genérico como se establece. Lo malo es que el cargador es de muy bajo amperaje y tarda una eternidad en cargar, creo al poner cargador genérico podrían incluir uno de carga rápida."

Afortunadamente esta la opción de devolver. Realmente esperaba mas."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","If I could give 0 stars I would. The ad said that it was a brand new phone but it wasn’t.

Currently looking into returning the phone. Not pleased at all"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","En lo personal no me agrado que en todo el marco tenga detalles, especialmente por que menciona que no se verán a una mano de distancia, pero se ve. De más. No se distingue tanto en foto pero en persona si. Creo que no pediría otro."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular llego golpeado, decidí quedármelo porque es un fuerte gasto y no tengo manera para comprobar que el celular había llegado golpeado y no había sido yo. Me di cuenta hasta que lo saque del empaque. Compre un celular similar en Walmart y todo fue excelente, decidí darle la oportunidad al vendedor en Amazon, pero fallaron totalmente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Esperaba un poco más de estética en el equipo, llega rayado y con golpes es entendible por el precio pero para ser honestos si ya le van a invertir en este equipo pónganle un poco más y compren uno nuevo, yo lo hubiera hecho."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","El celular se veía perfecto hasta que intenté encenderlo. Noté que el botón de encendido estaba medio sumido y tuve que presionarlo más de lo normal para que respondiera. Este es una falla muy obvia. La verdad me decepcionó que esta falla no haya sido detectada por Amazon como lo indican en la descripción de sus productos Reacondicionados donde aseguran que revisan antes los productos. Es una pena ya que el resto del equipo estaba en muy buen estado. Lo devolveré inmediatamente ya que así no puedo aceptarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","me llego en perfecto estado con 97% de bateria todo perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Lo tuve que devolver el mismo día que me llegó, he comprado antes con BuySpry (en otra cuenta) y nunca me habían salido mal, sin embargo este equipo se calentaba mucho usando solo WhatsApp y tenía toques fantasma. Sin embargo acabo de pedir otro equipo con ellos."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","Llegó al día siguiente. Estéticamente es casi perfecto, sosteniéndolo a una distancia de 10 cm es imperceptible cualquier defecto.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro Max","No le compren a BuySPRY, en los bordes tenia golpes y raspones, al igual que venia con una mica de cristal para tapar rayaduras profundas en el display, con relación al precio se me hace muy injusto ya que a simple vista el equipo ya había sido usado por un largo tiempo. en la descripcion menciona que esta en buenas condiciones pero no es así."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was a bit skeptical when i read the reviews but woooww I'm amazed, its like a brand new phone. Battery life 100%,, and it was easy to transfer my staff from my old iphone.100% recommend=d"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone gets too warm when switched on and seems to use up the battery over a period of about 12 hours with minimal use. I take it that after a few charge up operations, this should normalize. Other than that, it works very well with a clear display and reliable functionality. The Otter Box protects the phone magnificently. I am generally pleased with the phone and there is no sign that it was ever used even for a day. Thank you for your reliable product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like the color, how it came with a glass screen protector, it was packaged very well and also came a day earlier than expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Iba a comprar el renewed premium por el tema del % de la bateria, sin embargo decidí por el normal, y me vino en 88% la bateria. La camara funciona perfectamente bien y todas sus funciones, rayones minimos en la pantalla, nada que me afecte. Excelente producto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","When I ordered they said that the excellent condition was supposed to be at least 90% but it is 82% which is low having in mind that any phone with a battery life below 80% the battery is going away really fast and 82% percent is not really far from that/"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love the phone, received the phone with 85% Battery Life, No scratches, little to No Dirtiness."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is great so far. Only had it a few weeks. Battery has good life and charges fast. The camera takes great pictures. This is a great phone for the cost. Would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My son is delighted with it. His previous iPhone was a 7 without any memory left. I have the 12 and they are very similar."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great product and in excellent condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Adquiri el Iphone 11 pro renovado excelente. Mediante el vendendor DirectCertified. Sin ningun rasguño, nuevo y al 100% de bateria. IN LOVE"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I dislike the fact that the Battery is draining too fast, a part from that everything is working fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Doesn’t come with original charger, but neither does a new iPhone 😂
They added a nice glass screen protector too.
Great experience overall, and lightning-fast shipping."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me agrado la condición de la bateria, y la excelente condicion que de ve el telefono fisico, 100% recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased the renewed premium, phone did not have any scratches and battery was %100. I was lucky to get this phone it is basically brand new. Everything is functioning on the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No damage or scratches Battery 94% Quick transfer from old iphone 6. Fast Delivery!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came in good condition very satisfied came with charger and all it’s not an apple charger tho but the phone hood battery well recommend getting"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular tenía unos pocos rayones, a los lados la Pantalla esta bien, fotos también la batería está al 80% por el costo fue una buena compra hasta el momento"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It’s as good as brand new considering the fact that it’s renewed. Superb face recognition and a long battery life! So why buy brand new?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I recommend this in lieu of purchasing new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ordered and received an iPhone 11 Pro (excellent condition). Screen and back glass are virtually flawless and aluminium siding is in great condition. Front screen protector came already installed on phone (a nice bonus). Battery life is a bit lower than hoped for (83%) but still gets thru day even under heavy usage. Prime shipping went without hiccup and picked up at a local amazon locker. Highly recommend this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I Love my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received the phone in beautiful condition. Everything worked and I was pleased with the purchase until I inadvertently forgot it in the pocket of my swim trunks and I stepped into the hot tub. The phone was exposed to a water depth of about 18 inches for about 5 seconds when I realized it. I pulled it out of my pocket immediately. Every lens was fogged with water, and my true depth camera was immediately disabled. These phones are supposed to be IP68 rated and Apple says it can withstand submersion up to 4 meters for 30 minutes. My guess is that it was repaired and the seal was not done correctly. Very disappointing. I was fortunate that the condensation on the camera lenses eventually cleared, but face-id is still disabled."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got this to replace my old iPhone 6 as the battery was no longer charging. The phone was in really good condition when I received it. Battery lasts all day long to text talk play games/movies and use GPS. Picture quality is good. I am not tech savvy and was worried about learning how to use the new phone but have been pleasantly surprised. Easily paired with air pods and now I am always listening to music on my long walks. Love the iPhone 11! Am happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Look brand new! Was looking for a ProMax,though. Nice phone overall."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So my iPhone 11 Pro came a day early. I opened the Box it came in, mind you it’s do not expect an Apple packaged box. The box came with the iPhone and a charge head and cod( not apple branded ). The phone had a screen protector for the screen and the camera. No scratches came with the phone. The phone felt and looked like a brand new one. I would have given it 5 stars but it came with a non apple charger head and cod. In conclusion you should buy this."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excellent!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","On a fixed income and needed to upgrade my phone. Found one in my budget and had mostly positive reviews. Will be awhile before I get a feel for it’s performance. Delivery time sucked but that’s on UPS."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone works just fine with no problems. I've had it for over a year now and the phone has been fine, as expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Esta en muy buen estado no tiene ninguna imperfección me encanto ☺️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Unfortunately I need to keep buying smartphones because they are an essential part of life, but the spying capabilities of these phones are a violation of personal privacy.

CAMERA
The camera is the best it's ever been. The photos are incredible. The processing does something to your skin to make it look smooth. The portrait option makes the figure pop out in the frame.

SCRATCHING
This iPhone scratches when just in a pocket and touching normal clothing. I've never used a screen protector and had an iPhone scratch so easily. On reading more, I see this is a common problem with the iPhone 11 and is because they made the glass stronger, which made it scratch easily. Apple should provide a warning on purchase and a free screen protector, but they do not.

BATTERY
Much faster than my previous iphone 7. I have leftover charge each day after one full charge overnight.

FACIAL RECOGNITION EASE OF USE
This is a downgrade from the iphone 7. The fingerprint sensor was fast. The facial recognition has not added anything to the phone - it's made the phone slower and more cumbersome. ApplePay is not fun to use anymore. The side button is a hassle to double click through a case for Apple Pay.

For some reason, Force Touch was removed from the phone. This removes a lot of functions or makes them much slower. The iphone 7 was probably the best iphone Apple made in terms of responsiveness and efficiency.

THE APP STORE
Still can't read all reviews on the app store for an app. How am I supposed to know what people think of the app?

SPYING
Did you know that:
-It is impossible to turn off WiFi or Bluetooth so that you can always be tracked
-Anyone can purchase your tracker information from private companies and know anything about you
-When you give an app permission to access your photos, the people running the app can access every single one of your photos
-When you give an app access to your microphone, it can listen to you any time
-When you give an app access to your email, it can literally download and read all of your emails
-When you give an app access to your location at any time, it probably knows where you live and work
-Apps place lots of trackers on your phone. When you charge your phone at night, then is when it's sending out that data. This is the ""background app refresh"" setting on your app. Turn it off to stop the trackers. (to read more, check out the Washington Post article ""It’s the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?"")
-It seems that Apple plans to improve this with iOS14, but from the description of the features it will have, it will barely begin to cover all the problems

Apple should be more transparent and clear to customers on the tracking abilities of the phone. They should make private companies agree that they will not sell your data to law enforcement of the government."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Snergy delivered the Iphone 11 in perfect condition. I'm using the Iphone Internationally without any problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My dad, who does frequent international travel, has mulitple foreign country SIM cards. He used to have multiple ""burner"" phones for each country he traveled, but that got expensive and also cumbersome. He wanted an unlocked, full featured iPhone, but didn't want to pay the price of a brand new i13.

This i11 Max has good screen size, good resolution, good cameras and a good processor. It's not blazing fast or has the highest megapixels like the current gen, but it's good enough... and it has 256 GB of memory.

When foreign country SIM cards were inserted, the phone recognized it and we were able to do test texting (foreign country voice rates are really high!) with no problem.

The phone had very few scratches and the screen was scratch free. If you didn't look closely, you'd think it was new.

I recommend the extended warranty if you are local (US based), but if you are international, you will probably have cheaper repair costs over seas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great Phone and worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Neat and nice"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in slower than originally noted to ship, but not too bad. iPhone 11Pro is in good cosmetic shape with one noticeable scratch to the screen prior to applying my tempered glass screen protector. After charging it up fully, found that it lists the battery life at 89%, not the minimum 90% they promise, but not low enough to want to warranty or request a replacement, but enough to knock off a star. Have used the phone for a few weeks and battery life remains at 89%, so it appears to be pretty good and it lasts longer on a charge than the 5+ year old iPhone 7 I replaced. So far I am over all happy with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","All i can say is..GET THIS!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No se escucha bien el audio calificación mala"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in perfect condition. I’m not sure if the battery life should have been at 100 considering it’s a refurbish phone, but it was at 84% once it arrived. Meaning it’s going to lose battery fast and take time to charge. I’d keep this in mind if you’re thinking of buying!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I needed to upgrade my phone, but new iPhones are due out soon and I didn't want to buy a NIB phone until that happens. The iPhone 11 Pro is a couple of years old, but it will meet my needs until I am ready to purchase the latest generation. I had recently bought this same model, used, on a popular reseller market site. The experience was terrible. The phone condition wasn't as good as it was advertised to be, not even close. The battery health was poor as well, again, a misrepresentation. I returned that phone immediately (more hassle) and bought one I am using now through Amazon. The experience was as different as night and day. This phone is in excellent condition, and the battery health meets the guaranteed minimum (over 80% capacity).I was confident in my purchase because I know that Amazon makes returns easy. Didn't need to go there because the phone is great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came in great condition only problem was the battery life at 83% but still a great product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The face recognition is great along with the new emoji/ bitmoji face tracking, has three camera in the back for different zoom and detail, it's also waterproof, the sides are rounded and are shiny, and the back of it has a new type of hard cover. It's not too small, nor too big for your hands. The performance is also great for this wonderful looking product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iPhone is locked by a different carrier than what I listed in the product description. Specifically purchased from this listing for model and carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hubiera preferido una vida útil de batería mejor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Likes: Clean, no scratches on screen or case. 90-day warranty against technical device failures, 30-day return policy. Face recognition works fine and all buttons are snappy and responsive just like new.Dislikes: SIM card drawer had some dirt around it which I cleaned easily. Battery has 83% life and display screen is not Apple certified which shows up as a warning on the Settings->About info page.Time will tell if upgrading/replacing an iPhone11 with 64GB and 87% battery life to this device with better telephoto lens and 8x storage was a good choice. Just know that “certified” doesn’t mean all parts inside are Apple certified. Consider that when making your purchase. Four stars on tech support for non-Apple display screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased a 11 pro reconditioned, visually the phone is absolutely perfect, even if it’s sent in a general box and inside a zip lock bag. They provide a paper clip with instructions to use it as SIM card compartment tool, and up to here is not amazing but acceptable.Phone comes with charger, so a plus for iPhone new standard, only problem, when the ring volume is at max, you can hear a vibration noise from the speaker, we have no time nor options to send it back for such a small defect, so probably will keep it as is unless it gets worse"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My battery is full charge but when it off the charger it shuts off. So Apple sent me a message advising me, the battery is NOT AN APPLE PART."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I haven’t had any problems with my phone and I have created so many memories with this device. 🤗"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was in good condition and came with a screen protectorHowever it was on 76% battery health when it was supposed to come with 80+I haven't found any other problems with the phone other than this issue"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had no problems with my phone at all. Battery life was at 100%, absolutely no cracks or scratches anywhere."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Worth buying a refurb"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Aun no puedo calificarlo, porque el vendedor se ofrecio a subsanar el inconveniente dando un credito, pero aun no me ha reconocido nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 Looks great so far, no scratches or anything. 5 stars for the outside. Phone was completely dead tho so I'll update later"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro"," Looks great so far, no scratches or anything. 5 stars for the outside. Phone was completely dead tho so I'll update later"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in a plain white box with a generic charging cable, charger and a sim extraction tool. The phone looks like new, I could not find any scratches or scuff marks and the screen looks like it's never been touched. The phone I received has 83% Battery health exceeding the 80% minimum guaranteed. I you want better battery health order an Premium Amazon Renewed phone. I inserted my Mint mobile sim and it immediately recognized it and started working, didn't even have to contact the carrier. I am very happy with my purchase, the phone looks like new and the battery life is more than I need in a day. Next phone upgrade I'm buying another Renewed phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery only 80% life"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","todo perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The only downside is that they tried to hide a scratch from the screen by placing a screen protector, no a big deal since the phone is refurbished, the battery health was at 83% so it seems to last around 5-6 hours of constant use (depends on use) other than that the phone is great an amazing deal for an iPhone with little to no issues at all if you can deal with the battery not lasting as long as a new phone and the small imperfections go for it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have Boost Mobile and wasn’t sure if this would work. But yes it’s unlocked so Boost was able to activate it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Second try from seller BUYSPRY, returned first one for scratches. This silver iPhone 11 Pro 256GB came with a glass screen protector that’s slightly off center and has a weird glue around it and in the earpiece that I’m trying to scrape off. Deep scratch over one of the front sensors shown in photo. Light scratches on rear camera bump rings. Good news is all sensors and speakers are in working order, even the scratched one. I don’t dare take off the screen protector as I believe it’s covering a lot of scratches, but I don’t see any scratches as is, so I give it a pass. Battery is at 100% life so I’m very happy there. Overall for $499 I’m happy with the purchase and will stick with it, and just hope that whatever is under the screen protector isn’t too bad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The display was a non-genuine part, and battery health was only 86% even though I paid for Renewed Premium. I returned this item."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is in decent condition. Screen has no damage, but there are scratches on the camera lenses and body. Battery heath is actually better than promised- 100%- however I got notifications that the screen isn’t a genuine part, so I can’t trust the waterproofing or longevity. Will update if I notice anything else."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Midnight Green and it looks fantastic, today almost 2 months into use, I have no regrets.

Short version:
If you want great performance, great cameras, and great battery life, go for it.

Not so short version:
2 months after my purchase, I am quite happy. I have been using Android since 2013 and today there are almost no options that can compete in the 3 main pillars that interest me: performance, camera and battery.

The box it came in was generic (as mentioned on Amazon Renewed), it comes with a also generic charger that charges up to 100% in about 1 hour 30 minutes (I thought it would be worse). It did not have a single aesthetic detail, everything perfect and with a 95% battery health.

The options I had were: the iPhone 11 (any version), Google Pixel 5 and OnePlus 8T. What convinced me most of all on the iPhone was the stabilization of the videos, it is something fantastic. Almost all the apps you used on Android are also available on the AppStore and the way iOS works is simply amazing.

I was afraid of getting bored, but that was not the case.

The only point ""against"" I find is that today the battery health decreased from 95% to 89% (in 2 months), I don't know why, but it still has a good life.

I love the photos and the way it handles the HDR, you just open the camera app and shoot, in videos, the best stabilization on a smartphone.

If you are looking for performance, cameras and battery, this is the best option. I saw that there are not too many important differences with the 12 or 12 Pro, more than the LiDar sensor and the 5G that for me are not essential.

I am very comfortable on iOS and the way everything works. I think I'll stay a long time. I hope it helps you.

--- UPDATE July 18, 2022

After 1 year and 6 months, the Face ID suddenly stopped working and with that a battery failure, it discharges much faster, I have ios 15.5 and although it shows a health of 88%, after the Face ID failure, it ends 3-4x faster. Sounds like planned obsolescence.

I am a disappointed in this aspect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works as intended"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was givin the option to return or refund, but I didn’t want to deal with the hassle because the issue is more than likely dirt in the speaker holes. Other than that it’s a great phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Las características y validación del nivel de bateria era del 80%, y debería ser superior"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Glad I picked it over the S22. Bought it from TCR and it came in mint condition, 81% battery health. Would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My wife was thrilled with this as a replacement for her iPhone 6s. Unfortunately after updating to iOS 15.6, we got a cellular error. After updating iOS AGAIN via PC and iTunes, we still had a cellular error. Apple support assisted us. We were advised that we had an issue with the iPhone itself and not the carrier. So we were forced to return it and pay more for a replacement. Of course, it was IMPOSSIBLE to make or receive calls or text messages, or cellular data. So it was useless as a cellular phone. I had no other choice. Returned it on Friday July 29 at the Amazon locker at 4925 S Broadway."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I got my wife this phone not only to finally get it into her head that apple makes a better phone then android but because she has been wanting an iPhone for as long as I have known her, Was hoping the battery life would have been better but with a renewed device you get what you get, I ended up paying the 70 dollars to put a new battery in the phone for her so now it is like a brand new phone. She is vary happy with it and now we aren't fighting over who uses android auto or apple car play lol."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo bien por suerte"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My first time buying a use phone. For a use phone it’s in pretty good condition the phone 97% clean"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto en buen estado excepto, batería cumple con lo exigido por amazon, 82% de capacidad, vino con accesorios genéricos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got what I paid for nothing more nothing less"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Considering my last phone I bought 4 years ago on Amazon from a really shady seller had a badly damaged camera and horrible screen burn in. This phone was immaculate and in really good shape. My only complaint would be the battery health being at 80%. This phone was definitely used yet despite that. I’m getting surprisingly good batter life. I would definitely recommend. However. Make sure you go with a seller who has high positivity rating. The sellers of this iPhone I got in particular had that and I got a great quality device overall. And I hope I have the pleasure of being another device from them in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The cell did not come in green it came in black and I find it very difficult to use. Maybe just me but I prefer another type of Smart Phone. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So I was really nervous when buying this because I saw a couple people say the screen was pushed out. I am here to let you know those people are not very smart, it is not the screen that is pushed out but instead a very thick and reliable screen protector that they apply for you! It's applied almost perfectly so I also thought my screen was pushed out, but after checking it's just a screen protector!
The battery life was at 89% which isn't a big deal to me as I switched from an iphone 7, pre battery upgrade, so it lasts MUCH longer. I can go about 16 hours of casually using my phone before I get >10%. If you want a new phone without the hassle I highly suggest getting this or others they have available. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery was 84%. Phone looked nee and is working perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tal como la descripción me resultó"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love this phone. It’s fast, dependable, reliable, and just works great. I take advantage of the dual sim feature and so far have been loving the seamlessness of it. Amazing battery too, way better than previous iPhones. Faster data. I can tell it is faster than the iPhone XS (previous model), and the cameras are better as well. I can assess that I don’t regret the upgrade.

HOWEVER....

I cannot say that I am 100% happy. For some reason, Apple removed 3D Touch from the iPhone 11 line, a feature that made the user experience even more personal and seamless. Haptic Touch is the replacement and it sucks. A HUGE step back..I feel like the phone is literally slower because the content doesn’t pop up upon applying pressure to the screen, but now you have to hold your finger on the content and wait longer. Apple thought nobody cared about 3D Touch and they were massively wrong. Everyone I know who upgraded is also disappointed. Such an easy, painless integration that made things so much easier. why the hell take it away?

Also, the iPhone 11 Pro is heavier than it’s predecessor, and it’s very noticeable. A lot more noticeable. It also feels thicker too.

The conclusion here is if you’re not a heavy power user you don’t HAVE to upgrade. If you do make the decision to however you would still be happy because it is a nice device overall despite missing 3D Touch and being heavier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I must admit I was very hesitant to purchase a used/renewed iPhone off Amazon but the cost savings, ease of purchase and Amazons history of standing behind their products convinced me to purchase it.

Pro’s:
1 - cost savings
2 - Amazons commitment (in writing) to stand by the product for a year (no questions asked) as well as battery capacity of 90% or better
3 - ease of purchase and on time delivery
4 - packaging was very “Apple-like” in its look and feel
5 - although I’ve only had the phone for 2 months, it has performed without flaw

Con’s: NONE

I highly recommend purchasing your next iPhone from Amazon…you will not regret it! 👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone I bought because my other one broke and there was no iPhone 11 or 12s available at my provider so i had to buy this one urgently and not only did it not come with the sim trey remover things it said it did but it is supposed to be an OLED screen but instead came with an LCDand those are things ive just noticed getting it the battery came at exactly 80% which it says is the minimum but if im paying for a premium renew I want something better then 80%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I needed to replace my old iPhone 6S as the battery life could not keep up with the latest apps and 16GB was not enough for my music as well as eBooks that I enjoy reading.The tough decision was which phone do I want? Android or another Apple phone. I liked all the features an Android phone provides, but wanted a phone that would last a long long time. I finally decided the Apple iPhone 11 Pro was the best-case phone that had plenty of storage and an eco-systems I was familiar with.The Pluses: It is an iPhone with a great screen, plenty of storage (256GB) and all the functions and features I am familiar with. It is a great phone when compared to all the other phones available at a reasonable price ($900 for a phone in my mind is insane, but having support and a quality phone, the price is expected.)The Minuses: For a phone that does not make coffee, or make my bed, the price is steep. It is hard to justify why a phone should cost so much. Then add to that the yellowish screen when you first turn it on is terrible. (Yes, I found other users with the same experience and yes I did all the recommendations to make the screen look more like my iPhone 6S.) Then there is the damned eco system you are stuck with - want to make your buttons smaller, nope; have the background change often and automatically, nope; add you own pictures to the phone, nope; have similar apps to Android, nope.Summary: I would recommend an Apple iPhone to anyone who likes Apple and the eco system. It is a beautiful phone. But if you are looking to buy a phone with a lot of features (apps) and want to tailor the phone like that of an Android phone, buy an Android and stay away, far away for the Apple and the stupid locked eco system."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The condition of the phone is clean, no scratchesThe only issue I have is the error I see in my settings display showing that the parts replaced are not genuine apple partsIf you all can live with this than this is a good dealOn a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 5 just because of the error I have on my phone regarding the parts replacedI guess you get what you pay for"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was trying to avoid spending a lot on a phone to replace my previous phone which I broke (first phone I've EVER broken) so thought I'd try a refurbished phone that was supposedly in 'excellent condition' but it arrived, I put the SIM card in and made a call and realised I couldn't hear the other person clearly. I bought it mostly to record video for auditions (I'm an actor) & when I recorded a video the sound playback was awful! Firstly even at full volume I could barely hear it, but what I could hear was muffled/crackly/unclear. It sounded distorted like when you record something and it's peaking at too high a decibel range. There was no way I could keep it with that bad sound quality."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This review is specifically for the Amazon renewed Apple iPhone 11 Pro. It came with a screen cover that I did not realize was on it. So I put another screen protector on it. The volume for incoming calls was horrible in the ear but okay on speaker phone or over Bluetooth. Since I couldn’t tell that the first screen protector was not part of the actual phone, I took it to GeekSquad at Best Buy who recognized the problem immediately. Upon removing that screen protector that had been installed with the refurb process, the volume was immediately good as you would expect it to be. They cleaned a bit of adhesive out of the ear speaker and placed my other screen protector back on which did not cover the ear sound area and now all is better. GeekSquad was great and free, but I shouldn’t have had the problem on a NewToMe phone in the first place."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Being the first phone I bought off of Amazon, I was a little hesitant in buying this product, especially when reading some of the reviews. However, I bought it because my old iPhone was glitching terribly and I needed a replacement asap. The product came two days earlier than expected & is working smoothly as of right now. The battery was at around 40% when it arrived so I assumed it wasn’t fully charged when shipped. It was also fully unlocked, had no scratches anywhere on the screen/phone, and speakers are clean. The box it came with had a charger and small paper manual to set up the new phone. I am very satisfied with everything."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone works fine. The screen had some fairly significant scratches in that the seller attempted to obscure with a poorly applied screen protector. Battery capacity is at 85% but holds a decent charge.While significantly less expensive than buying a brand new phone, this was still a pretty pricey purchase and I’m not 100% sure it’s the better value when you weigh the pros and cons, taking into consideration the condition of a “renewed” product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Very nice that i can make payments on the phone. Even tho no phone is worth so much. apple knows we cant leave without a phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sabemos que cuesta mucho creer cuando hay tanta y tantas opiniones diversas. Pero a las pruebas me remito. Mi iPhone 11 Pro llegó con 97% de condición de Batería. En óptimas condiciones, sin rayas en la pantalla ni en los laterales brillantes. Todo funciona perfectamente ¡Ah y hasta con protector de pantalla llegó! La caja blanca genérica en la que vino era un poco endeble, pero el teléfono estaba bien protegido por dentro. Cargador y cable genérico, pero hay que entender que es un equipo refurbished. Lo estoy utilizando en Venezuela con Movistar y va de maravilla.Si estás pensando comprar este equipo, es una excelente decisión. Ten presente que si lo cuidas bien podrás utilizarlo por uno 3 o 4 años más."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works great. Almost like new with exception of the battery life (84% capacity). It lasts me about 18 hours. Quality for money."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Like the size battery is great 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am annoyed that I paid extra for a renewed premium phone to receive 90-100% battery capacity and it only has 84%. I was afraid this would happen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After reading the negative reviews after ordering I was super scared that I had just made a big mistake. But I couldn’t be HAPPIER with the phone I received!!!! Perfect condition. Looks brand new. Battery life at 92% and works like it’s never been used before! It was expected to arrive 6 days after ordering but literally arrived the NEXT day! So happy I took the chance because I love my new birthday present to myself ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Iphone looks new and preform like new, I give 4 stars because it came with 89 percent battery health instead of the 90 or over as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iphone vino en excelentes condiciones, sin raspaduras, sin rayones, con protector de pantalla. Funcionando todo 100% y bateria al 80% . El envio fue bastante rapido.
Recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was hesitant purchasing from this company, at least at first. Compared to others they seem to be relatively new to Amazon, and that can end up poorly for the consumer if your not careful. However, after looking into their reviews of almost 100% customer satisfaction and excellent service I took a gamble at it.

Honestly I don’t think Iv found a more honest, reliable, and well mannered company on all of Amazon. My first phone I had issues with, user error in purchasing and instantly got a return. My second phone got damaged and I asked for a replacement. They were kind enough to give me options on what best suits my needs, all while paying for 2 day shipping, both to send out the new phone and to return the other. Not only did I receive a brand new phone, perfectly in condition, 100% battery life and not a scratch on it, they also gave me my refund the second the phone was in their hands 2 days later.

I cannot express enough to underrated this company truly is and how kind and helpful they have been to me over these past few weeks. Phones are not cheap, and they made the process smooth and reliable. Would easily purchase and recommend them again. They deserve it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Really good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the renewed premium which should include at least 90% battery health. Unfortunately it came with 88%"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phones came fast. a day early. Excellent condition. My husband and I are very happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came wrapped securely and was easy to set up. Very well taken care of and quality advertised was quality given. Would order from them again if I were to upgrade."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","working perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Little small but easy to use it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","For the price you pay, I would say this phone is pretty good. I have noticed some issues already with the device being slow and not always responding, but the issue seems to resolve itself in less than a minute. Other than that, the phone itself looks as if it is as new and functions like that besides the occasional freezing."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The speakers on the phone sounded terrible, like I had put the phone up to one of those plastic toy microphones. Upon closer inspection, the speaker holes were filled with brown stuff. I didn't use it for very long, as I noticed the speakers were not working pretty quickly, but it seemed like the touch screen wasn't working properly either. Sometimes the phone wasn't sensitive if I touched the top third of the screen. The battery came at 84%. Apart from some slight scratching at the bottom of the screen, the phone looked good. The other reviews seemed good, so maybe I just had back luck."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I may be returning it I’m trying to give it a chance I don’t like the fact that the volume isn’t high enough I think there’s something wrong with it and the phone froze on me I had to turn it off to get it to work again so we’ll see"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Did not provide Ear phones & charging cable.
The charger adapter is NOT a genuine product (NOT from apple).
Phone is under observation. getting an impression that its"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone shipped quickly and arrived next day at a fedex warehouse within 25 miles. It then sat there for several business days before it actually was out for delivery. Screen is pretty scratched with one in particular being especially deep. Battery health was advertised as 90% or better but came at 84%. Phone works and is unlocked as advertised but I wouldn’t recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Imma be real, when i bought this i actually thought samsung logo was gonna pop up but it didn’t. No scratches on the phone so idk what these other reviews are saying🤨. Came in nice and clean. Can’t show yall pictures cuz im USING IT. But yea, if y’all need a phone, go buy it🤝🏾"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","With the amount of money I spent I this phone I expected the battery life t be in the 90’s or 100% but I received the phone with 83% battery life. Which isn’t terrible but for what I spent I expected better. 83% is good for 2-3 years of use without major battery drainage."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Used, refurbished, with 80% battery size, with the screen burnt by long-time display on.
It doesn't have severe problem. It could be a phone used for display in a cellphone store so that the screen has marks and shadows of icons and signal bars left on.
If you don't care these flaws, it's still worth to buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Former android user. Switched to iPhone for camera quality. Phone performance is what you would expect from iPhone. Excellent camera and battery. Smooth is. Purchased this item as refurbished so I didn’t expect it to be like new. However there were several deep scratches in the front glass, hidden by a screen protector. Minus one star for this as I feel that the seller should have disclosed the scratches. Seller also misrepresented the shipping time. The phone did not actually ship until after it was supposed to have been delivered (received seller email notification that phone had shipped, 2 days after it was supposed to have been received). Minus another star for delivery dishonesty. Would have been 5 stars if not for these service issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Well, I started out giving my phone three stars because of some glitches. The questions Amazon asks about this certified refurbished iPhone 11 Pro don’t really apply. But being an iPhone gal I mostly love it. So I decided to go up to four stars. I went down a little in size from a 7 Plus, and the smaller size is better for me. But no real learning curve which also suits me since I have the patience of a puppy. Just a few issues though, including there being periods a week or two long sometimes when I cannot select text for copying and pasting etc. And the touch screen not registering my touch to open a link or complete a command. Sometimes I am unable to attach photos to a text from the Messages app; I have to go through the Photos app and select a photo and then write any text from there. And for over a week now my caps lock is nonexistent; if I want to yell at somebody I have to capitalize each letter separately. And you wouldn’t believe how annoying it is when you’re in the middle of shouting at somebody, and somewhere while you’re typing each capital letter at a time your righteous anger begins to drain away from the offender and is redirected at your phone because - yes - you have the patience of a puppy. Ok I don’t really yell at folks with my texts. But this is what I’m sayin’. Whoops, now I have to change the number of stars back down to 3 from a four."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m well aware that it is a refurbished phone but this battery came to me at 73% life or something and it dies very fast"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","it feels like i have a brand new phone. When i got it, it was on 87% witch is pretty high for a refurbished phone. I dont see any marks on the phone or anything like that. If i had to complain about anything, it would be that the front camera isnt as nearly as good as the back as far as clarity goes but maybe thats how it usually is. over all, extremely happy with my purchase. no regrets."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Typical fears of being scammed, not getting what I ordered, or it being completely broken; I got my package and seen the box and my heart SUNK when I seen a generic smart phone box but when I opened the box there was a shinny, basically brand new iPhone!

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I got this phone in and it came with a screen protector, I thought oh that’s nice of them! But the screen protector had a bubble in it so I decided to go ahead and change it.When removing the screen protector It revealed a lot of scratches on the screen.Check your screen if it comes with a protector already installed!!! My screen is scratched so much under the protector!!! They aren’t being nice, they are being tricky."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery is at 95%, as expected. It would be best if price is low by $50"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","First time buying a refurbished phone. Was very nervous about the whole process but desperately needed another phone and wanted something affordable not wanting to use my carrier and having to renew with them another 2 years.The phone matched the description perfectly and I love the 90 day free from defect policy. I am extremely pleased with all aspects of my purchase, will do it again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My renewed iPhone 11 Pro was from Buyspry. While I kept my phone and am very happy with it I gave it 4 stars. I took 1 star off because the screen had some pretty decent sized scratches and I'm honestly surprised they did not try harder to fix that. They had a cheap glass screen protector on it when it arrived and I replaced it with my own. I could kind of see some what appeared to be light scratches but after taking the screen protector off they were pretty bad. If I were someone who did not use a screen protector I would have sent it back. But once I put on my new tempered glass screen protector it really does mask the scratches and I can't even see them.The rest of the body of the phone was in excellent condition, no other scratches or dings. The screen looks great and my battery health is at 100%. I'm sure this will last me for a while. Really the gamble here is probably dependent on who the seller is. But considering how much cheaper it was I don't regret getting this from Amazon Renewed."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","N/a"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not as descripbed, bettery life 85% with scratches and small dents on the right side. Ended up returning it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I realize this was a refurbished phone, so I wasn’t expecting something that looked flawless. That being said, it came in WAY better shape than I thought it would!! It had so signs of wear but nothing crazy; the glass had a couple minor, very small scratches you can’t even see with the screen on. That being said, I also bought a life proof case and with built in screen protector, you’d think it was a brand spanking new phone. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quality phone at a reasonable price, backed by a seemingly reasonable warranty."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I did not expect this from the buyer but he is awesome. I loved the phone. He gave the phone with a screen guard and a charger and a cord light scratches on the metal strip that is around the phone but still it’s not that bad. And getting a 512GB iPhone 11 Pro for 600 is a good deal. I’m pretty happy with the phone and it’s performance. It comes unlocked and it’s all good to go. The camera is perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came damage I can’t hear from the receiver"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Way better than I expected! Great condition, battery is 87% but honestly its way better than my old phone so I'm super thankful."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estaba preocupada por los comentarios que decían sobre la batería. Pero aunque me ha llegado con 84% de condición, es excelente su performance. La cámara es espectacular y me incluyeron un proyector de pantalla que realmente agradezco. Todo bien!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is everything you'd expect from an IPhone. There's no mystery there. It works and performs great.However, the description for the phone clearly stated:- This product is in ""Excellent condition"". It shows no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 12 inches.The back of the phone is covered in blemishes that will not simply come off. Bleach stains? Water damage? Hard to tell. But it's clearly not a case of ""no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 12 inches""Still considering returning...."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am a new Apple user, so I went from an android to iPhone. Problems with getting What's APP from old Android to new iPhone, couldn't in the end. Problems getting my photos from old Android on to new iPhone. Love the colour, love the look, just takes time getting use to it and no idea yet what all the features are all about. Amazon gave great service with regard to delivery."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone looks really good. No signs of use. Everything works great. I was able to switch my SIM card into it with no problems. I’ve had the phone for 4 months now and it’s still working just fine."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It’s what I ordered, it was ready for use.I didn’t like that the phone came with a cracked screen protector and when I removed the screen it had lots of adhesive and it took a few hours to remove it all. Once removed I noticed a few scratches that are viewable while the screen is on."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Looks new from outside but battery life only 83% so i tried to change it with higher battery % but the seller told me he canot garantee that so i returned it back"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","If you thinking about making a purchase this seller I would recommend, ordered my phone and received it in 2 days, when opening the box the phone came with a power cable and charging block the phone looked brand new with only 1 small scratch on the left corner. Other than that everything works 100% phone was completely unlocked no issues getting service through a provider, I’m glad I made this purchase saved me over $500 I would highly recommend this seller.Notes: battery health 90%, with tiny corner scratch and came with a screen protector already installed.5 star product, very fast shipping, safe buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Definitely a refurbished phone. Giving 4/5 stars cause it had some small scratches on the screen (not screen cover) and the corners of phone. Had to put a new screen protector on cause it was damaged and the phone was really dirty when I got it. Had to deep clean it. Not a real iphone charger, but it works. Anyhow, the phone works, cameras work, microphone and sound work, but battery life a little low. Suggest getting a new SIM card from carrier since the old one won’t work in it. Overall, good phone, but considering all the other stuff, price could have been lower."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Decent"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My phone came in perfect condition. No scratches or nicks at all. The battery is at 93% health which is alright with me. This is a big jump for me from iPhone 6s to 11 Pro.The display is really nice and the face recognition is a great feature. It was easy to switch sims and transfer data over. I opted to go for renewed premium because of the year long replacement/warranty and the better quality of the phone. The premium was a pricey jump but who knows what could happen to a used phone within a year so I think it’s worth it.Altogether it is right in the middle of expensive and affordable. The phone has been working near identical to a brand new 11 Pro and I’ve been very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This came fast, works perfectly, has 100% battery capacity and was a great bargain. Will shop Olympic Wireless again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like the phone but a month ago I switched cases to a case that has its own screen protector and removed the INSTALLED screen protector that came with the phone which revealed tons of scratches which is upsetting. the phone looked perfect except for how bad the screen looks without a protector on"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was perfect! No defects/scratches/signs of use, etc.It's perfect and has great battery life. I had to charge my previous iphone constantly throughout the day. This one lasts me all day with many hours of use, daily.Definitely recommend!The only thing I'd say is that it isn't as green as it seems like it would be (based on the pictures). Even in good lighting the green looks a little more gray.But still love it"

 Todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro"," Todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got here fast, uploaded quickly, all good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","At first I was going to return it cause it was smaller than the 11 but after putting my case on and accepting it I Decided to keep it, it works just like new and I was originally trying to get my services through boost mobile as I was a customer with them for years but this phone was not compatible with boost so I went to metro and everything pretty much went smooth. No scratches , dents or anything wrong with the sound it works just like new. For half of the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Arrived on time. Looks good. Takes horrible pictures. The quality is poor. Reverted to my previous iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Takes excellent pictures"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the phone in March. It arrived in decent condition; the audio was always a little wonky but it was passable. Last week, the phone just died and would not turn on. It’s still dead and I ended up purchasing a new phone. Moral of the story; purchase some type of extended warrant coverage. I contacted the seller on here and was told they have a 90 day guarantee and since it’s been more than 90 days there’s nothing they can do."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good quality, good customer service, battery life okay, cosmetically good, product as described.

Declutter did have prompt replies to my inquiries. However they could not comply with my request to leave the product at the door. Fortunately, I was home to sign for the item."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone works so its a W fr..got ghost touch 2 months after but im gon get it fixed fr

;-;"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo esta en muy buenas condiciones, solo por un desgaste esperado la batería no es tal cual si fuera nueva, la cámara es excelente y permite hacer todas las operaciones de busqueda, consulta, registro y descarga en forma muy ágil, el tamaño es otro aliado sin tener un formato muy grande, usa toda la supeficie disponible, en resumen un muy buena opción de compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased an iPhone 11 Pro 256 gb Renewed Premium. Item was in a like new condition. Physically as was described. Was very very disappointed though when I checked the battery health and found that it was 88% and not the 90+% as stated for Renewed Premium phones. Contacted Amazon and was given a discount. Still love doing business with them…Facial recognition is quick, battery life is left to question…Maybe need to tweak settings. Overall good value. Just need to give customers what is advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone, battery is on the older side but to be expected, excellent condition aside from a couple small marks, good seller communication."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Despite all the negative reviews I saw on amazon my product arrived a week late but it was as advertised it had a brand new Apple certified battery minimal scratches on the phone and everything was in good working order. Definitely worth it if you are looking to get an iPhone 11 pro but don't want to pay the price for a new one,and I would recommend it over the iPhone 12 pro just because of the better battery and the fact that 5G is not available in most areas especially the ultra wide band high speed one so if you can live without the 5G this is definitely the phone to pick up, and the cameras are absolutely amazing I was blown away with how well they performed in the dark, these are the best iPhone cameras I've seen yet, I would like to compare them to a pixel at some point but make no mistake this is an amazing camera. As a photographer I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to take good pictures with as little hassle it's not a replacement for a DSLR camera but it's a great camera to have in your pocket and to shoot on the spot."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Item standout. Delivery was state-of-the-art. The packaging was very, very well-chosen. Recommended."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was really nervous and skeptical about ordering such an expensive item online. But i was not disappointed at all. The phone arrived in only 3 days! The phone was neatly and securely packaged. I seen some peoples reviews state that this company lies and these phones are not new and they have scratches etc. THEY ARE REFURBISHED - which means they have been used, and so some amount of scratching/dings should be expected. With that being said, there is only one very light scratch on the phone i received and can only be noticed if you are really looking for it. It is unlocked for all carriers as it states. It does not come with a sim card! YOU HAVE TO BUY A SIM CARD FROM THE PROVIDER YOU WANT TO USE. This isnt a big deal at all, i was able to purchase one from my provide (Boost Mobile) for $10.00 - i mention this only so that if you plan to buy this phone, buy a sim card from your provider at the same time, so you dont have any delays when you try to activate the phone.

In conclusion - definitely worth the money and I'm so happy i went ahead and bought this phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Minimal physical scratches, almost like new and so far works well. battery life came at 85%. overall I'm pleased with the purchase as there are no issues thus far"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone itself is great. No obvious scratches, speakers look clean, camera works great, etc. I’ve had no issues with the phone, and I think it’s a great value for the money. That being said, phones under this condition are supposed to have battery health above 90% and this one came to me at 89%. Not a huge deal except that they did say that it would be above 90 and it wasn’t. That being said, the battery lasts me easily all day and can even get me through two days depending on my usage. Overall, great phone. No regrets"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Shipping took a little longer then expected but other than that the iPhone 11 Pro looks brand new out of the box… battery looks to be at 100% even got lucky enough that it has AppleCare+ theft and loss until august 1st of this year

I would hands down buy from Amazon again as long as it’s (renewed premium)

$649.99 for an iPhone 11 Pro 512gb isn’t to bad in todays 2nd hand market… got it as a gift for my older sister who’s birthday is coming up"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Por el momento todo se encuentra a la perfección, talvez el micrófono se escucha un poco bajo pero nada que no sea tolerable, muy buena compra y buen vendedor llego muy rápido, si pudiera criticar algo seria el cargador, te envían uno genérico chino muy malo. El vendedor es HybridIT"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything about the phone itself was great. Delivered in excellent condition and good protective packaging. The only thing that bothered me was the charger cable was garbage and in less than two weeks I had to get a replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am happy with the purchase so far, I was only concerned with the battery life but it seems like holding pretty good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it only thing is my wifi keeps dropping and I’m missing calls and messages on WhatsApp idk why"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is my first Iphone and will most likely be my last; what a pain in the wazoo. Phone itself is a disappointment with ""renewed"" battery to 87%, not the 90% promised. Also, it's been around the block a time or two, too many Apple ID's created with this phone so had to talk with Apple and get that straightened out. Cosmetically, it looks OK and seems to work OK, too but, I won't do this again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received this as a gift. Easy to set up and use as I’m a previous iPhone user. It was as easy as taking out my old SIM card and inserting it! My husband got this for me as I love to take pictures but I haven’t been too impressed with the camera. Portrait mode is only beautiful when there’s plenty of light and the object is still has frozen water. Anything else and the quality is terrible. I heard night mode is beautiful but honestly I don’t see much of a difference from an iPhone 6s! The video quality is great and movements in video is good. I have enjoyed the editing that can be done directly on the phone. I do miss the home button off older versions. This new one uses Face ID which is not always useful as your phone has to be aimed at your face! Most of the time I have to use the passcode. Not sure if the things I’m complaining about is because it’s not a brand spankin new iPHone 11pro or it’s just the iPhone 11pro!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like the fone so far but the charger that it shipped with does not work. I thought I would be getting a fast charger since it is the pro version."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This was from the ""Amazon Renewed Store"" but is actually shipped by a company called TechExchange in Brooklyn NY. The phone comes in a pretty unimpressive generic box. The phone had some plastic sheet sticker over it and came with a cheap aftermarket ""Shark brand"" charging adapter and Shark lighting cable.

The phone itself was in EXCELLENT condition! There were some dust on the corners of the camera bump but that was easily cleaned. Finally, there was a bit of slight scratches on the metal border. Totally reasonable for a used phone, especially since I will be putting it in a case anyways! Finally the battery was a whopping 94% health! The listing guaranteed 80% battery health so 94% was far better than I expected! The battery life is the true indicator of the age of the phone which means it was very lightly used. Obviously your mileage will vary but I would not hesitate to buy this again in the future. If it's a bad condition phone, just return and rebuy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was nervous because of some reviewers who got scratched or defective phones, but I got a very good one!! If anything happens I will update the review. The phone looks like new, works great and got it with 88% battery life. So far I am very happy.
UPDATE: After 10 days, still running perfect. Battery last very well. It does not have enough signal strength as my previous phone, a galaxy Note 8, which gave me all 3 or 4 bars inside home, this iphone only gives me 1, but I have no issues making or receiving phone calls."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in an off brand box but was nicely placed and had protection covering front and back. The phone also came with a free screen protector already placed on the phone which is appreciated. Happy with my purchase!! I recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was a little worried to purchase this phone due to the mixed reviews. My main concern was battery life and was really hoping they’d send me one with 90-100% - once it got to me I was so shocked to see it had 100% battery life! The quality of this phone overall is exceptional for the price I paid and I couldn’t be happier. I would definitely consider buying from this company again — thank you so much!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Imagine my surprise when I transferred my number to find out that the company didn’t use a genuine apple screen to replace the screen. While the phone is working fine now, I’m concerned that it may not with future updates. I’ll keep the phone now but may have to change my review in the future. Not feeling so great about this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It made me nervous to buy such an expensive “renewed” item, so I’m happy to report this looks like a brand new phone - not a single scratch or any sign of having been used. The only complaint I have (which is with Apple not the seller nor Amazon) is that the battery health is only 84%. For an iPhone 11 that seems like quite a deterioration. My iPhone 7 was at 84% when I replaced it with this. It does seem to lose battery life faster than I thought it would.

All the apps I use uploaded fine, no problem with the software update. Bluetooth connection worked, connected to WiFi.

A generic charging wire and block were included and the phone was totally unlocked and ready for me to link to my prepaid provider.

I’ve only just gotten this phone so I will update if it breaks down or has issues. So far, so good. I’m very happy with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Really enjoy this, especially the improve3d camera features."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente! Sin rayas, batería duradera, tomó el chip de varias líneas telefónicas, impecable el tlf. Funciona muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My earpiece speaker didn’t work so I had to get it replaced"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Upon receiving this phone, I was glad that I didn’t see any scratches or marks in the screen or the back. But the anti-dust mesh next to front microphone gave away the secret. It seemed badly aligned and the color of the mesh wasn’t even uniform throughout. It is small but my eyes caught it quick!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was pleasantly surprised when my new (to me) iPhone 11 Pro arrived. It was in perfect condition & I could not find one flaw on any of the surfaces. I set my old iPhone 6S next to it and all the information transferred seamlessly, removed the SIM card from the old phone and inserted it in the new phone and was up and running in 15 minutes. It has been one week since this and the phone works like new except the battery health is 86% but, it is a used phone and I am OK with that. I will replace the battery at some time in the future. The camera in this phone is light years ahead of my iPhone 6S and I might just stop carrying my point-and-shoot cameras for most situations. I would definitely purchase another phone from this seller in the future based on this experience."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo super hasta el momento con el telefono super nitido bateria palabra para describirlo CALIDAD. el unico detalle que tengo es que al momento que realizaron el cobro no lo hicieron como solicite en mi moneda no en US eso me trajo bastante problemas al momento de hacer el cambio y pago a dolares con mi tarjeta. por el resto CALIDAD pero con eso si tienen que explicar un poco mejor esa situacion."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was nervous to receive a beat up, scratched or damaged phone but ended up being pleasantly surprised.Not a scratch in the screen, no biffs, no bangs, no dents, no port damage, the apple logo on the back does have few little surface scratches but no biggie there.The buttons on the side look and work great, the camera works well, no dead pixels and the screen is very responsive so far. GPS seems to work correctly. Speakers sound great on calls and with music. WiFi and cellular calling and data works well and is fast, much better than My previous iPhone X.The only downside I’ve seen so far is that the phones battery’s maximum capacity is at 89% meaning that the battery won’t last as long as it would from a “new” battery from a full charge.Overall a Great value, better than buying new from apple.512GB to store photos, videos, music, games and lots of space for apps. Best phone I’ve had yet.I’m happy with My purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received yesterday. So far so good. Battery life is great hasn’t gone dead at all yet. I’ll come back in a few months to update my rating if anything has changed"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone, looks literally brand new even though is refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I could not get my product to connect to ANY service. We could not use the phone unless it was connected to Wi-Fi and at that we still couldn’t dial out. I’m waiting on a return slip hopefully the next one will work."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo único que no me gusto que en una esquina vino como con pega, lo pude limpiar con cuidado pero es como que tenia cerdas de brocha que tuve que sacar con cuidado, de ahí todo en orden"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo muy bien con el telefono llego a muy buen tiempo super buen estado si lo recomiendo al 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","When buying this know they do not replace the battery my phone came in with 80% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me impresionó la calidad del celular vino prácticamente como nuevo, no tiene rayones y la batería estaba al 99% la pantalla cambia en bien en los modos True Tone y la cámara esta bien. Muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fast Shipping- arrived a day early which was appreciated! the power cord and charging cable that was supplied did not function as promised, the phone functions acceptably and so far has no issues.I ordered the 11pro in green, in EXCELLENT condition, it came with a glass screen protector still applied from the last user. the phone was dirty as well.The one thing I am challenged with is even though it was ordered in excellent condition, there are nicks and dings on the chassis, scratches on the glass and the last user must not have used a case because the corners are etched and dinged, rough like it was dropped a couple times.I feel like I received a ""good"" or 'fair"" condition phone, but Definitely NOT an EXCELLENT condition phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good deal for the buck. No need spend over price if it's the same device. The downside there's no apple care if you buy it new, headphones and the original packaging charger. But those you can buy care from a 3rd party or take it to a store for repairs. Headphones you can buy it from a 3rd party also a charger. It will also be less than the original price. Is a good way to reduce clutter for our environment. Phone looks new when opening it was amazing. Had 80% battery life which was amazing. Transfering data is so much easier just by having both devices near to each other. It only works if your device is updated with the latest IOS. I will say kinda bad but not much was the color I order was the dark mint green but I got the gold. I wont complain since I was looking first gold but saw it in a different price. So just in case if you really wanted a specific color just keep a look out."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased the iPhone 11pro directly from Amazon as the merchant. Decided since the item is a renewed item that I’m better off doing the renewed premium which guarantees minimum 90% battery life and all minimum wear and tear. “Like New” product. Received the phone and battery was 82% the volume down button was Stuck and the speakers on the bottom of the phone did not work. I tried making a phone call and put it on speaker and no voice came out. Same day I received the item I requested a return. They tried offering an 80.00 discount which for a phone over 500.00 was not much. The Carrier picked the Item the next morning and it was delivered to the return facility within a few days. Amazon return policy on the platform when I inquired stated 3-5 business days after the return center receives the item. When speaking to a rep via chat they stated it can take up to 30 days for it to arrive and process a refund from the return center which conflicts with the refund guidelines stated on their FAQ. Very disappointed not only are they holding my funds I am also without a cell phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bit bummed out about the battery life. It was at 84% so off user properly winner last the entire day which is not convenient at all. Besides that the phone was in pristine condition and was quite impressed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received the phone today and was extremely happy to replace my water damaged iPhone XS witch had mic and FaceTime issues. Once I put my prepaid Verizon SIM card in the new phone, I couldn’t make or receive any calls. I checked my the account and it showed my account was all a sudden suspended. I immediately contacted Verizon customer service and was told my account was suspended because the device was reported lost or stolen by “Asurion” and can’t be used with Verizon. My SIM card no longer works as it’s been also flagged for using it in a stolen phone, so now I’m stuck without a number until I can go and buy and reactive the SIM card on my old phone.The phone came in great condition no flaws that are easily noticeable. Battery’s life cycle was at a 100%, it didn’t come with the authentic “box” or most importantly the authentic fast charger/cable. The SIM card tray on all iPhones will have a small print of the MEID which will match the MEID in the phones menu. My tray had a completely different MEID to what’s on the phones menu.Don’t be fooled with the high ratings. Most of the issues are not even noticeable to the majority. 9/10 of the iPhones sold from this seller is originally Verizon and blacklisted, BUT! Not the type you would easily notice. Verizon iPhones come factory unlocked from Verizon. If a stolen Iphone doesn’t have iCloud and is unlocked, typically this phone wouldn’t work with any of the major carriers that require the MEID to be linked with the SIM card. However many phones that are reported lost/stolen are sold overseas as most countries don’t tie the MEID with SIM card like we do and one can just plug the SIM card and your ready to go. This also applys to some of the prepaid networks that we have available. If you have one of those prepaid accounts you won’t notice that your phone is actually reported stolen and that once you try to switch carriers you’ll be buying a new phone.Plus, Not to mention that, one would buy an iPhone with insurance and sell it without iCloud. The buyer would be happy for a couple of months until the seller decides to claim it’s lost/stolen and receives a new phone while the other get blacklisted, just like what happed to the phone I received."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this is a gift for my girlfriend. The condition is more like used, instead of refurbished…The phone came with a screen protector on it (which I thought was kinda odd). Took it off to replace with a privacy protector, and behold, the phone as TWO deep scratches on the screen. Not minor scratches, but actual deep scratches. That’s why these “refurbished” phones come with screen protectors on them already.Good news is that you can return it for a full refund.I was going to return it for a refund, but my girlfriend is happy with it. I plan on replacing the screen for her once it gets used up anyways.BUT BEWARE!! Your phone will most likely have deep scratches on it under the screen protector. I bought a refurbished note 10 plus and the phone was absolutely flawless! But that’s not the case here, like I said, the condition is more like used instead of refurbished.If you do buy one, make sure you take off the screen protector it comes with and inspect for scratches!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My doubts about their doing a real refurbishing are pretty strong. Apparently, they didn't even do a basic exterior cleaning properly.The SIM Card remover tool was not included as advertised.I brought the item basically unopened to Best Buy for assistance in setting it up. The first thing that the GEEK Squad tech rep. noticed was that there was ear wax in the ear piece area, and the microphone area was dirty. Since I watched him clean those areas with an alcohol swab, I know that was the case. Had I not needed the phone immediately, I would have returned it to the seller.There were no visible blemishes on nor damage to the case. The functions appear to be working properly, and the battery seems to keep its charge for quite awhile. None of that proves refurbishing nor eases my concerns....but time will tell. I only hope that, if time proves this to be a dud, that it happens within the allowed return period. A company that instills doubts instead of confidence in its customers has a real problem."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Speaker voice was not clear, speaker’s net was very very dirty, I cleaned it by spit and issue solved……….."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto recibido en condiciones adecuadas y en tiempo requerido. Muchas gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Firewire would not insert easily. So we put under a magnifying glass and noticed some cr..p in there. Along with white paint overspray. Obviously from 'renewing' the white phone. It did arrive on time and was packaged nicely with a 2 port usb charger and shorter firewire cord. The usb block sparked as I put it in the wall outlet. We did not attempt to use that. Used our old apple cord once the junk was removed from the port. Would not take a charge. Sent back immediately for refund. Will make one more attempt at a renewed phone from amazon. But not buying from BuySPRY ever again. Had we looked closer we'd have noticed their horrible ratings."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I don't buy the latest and greatest - over three years ago, I bought my 1st cell phone (work gave me a 5s), and was sticker-shocked by the cost of an apple-certified 16Gb 6s for $300. So naturally, I made it last as long as I could. My battery is now at 70% health, and dies quite quickly whenever I do anything that isn't texting or calling.Now that the 12s are out, I decided I would get the best last-model, and began searching for an 11 pro. After reading reviews of this seller, I was a little leery to get something that might have visible scratches on the screen, or have hardware/software issues - As you can see in the photos, I have no issues yet. The screen/body are unblemished, and so far, no fatal errors in use. If anything pops up, I will come back and comment.While I feel for the people who had issues with their referbished model arrive with errors, I would recommend it. Hey, if there's an issue, Amazon has a return policy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This was ordered by someone not to be on my account so it was returned. This still made me rate it so I did 5 star?? Didn't know what to dom"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The best"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’ve had this phone one day so far. I upgraded from the 7plus. It feels heavier in the hand. I don’t mind it at all. I got it for the color haha it came at 87% for the battery health. The battery life is good so far. It doesn’t die fast like my last phone did. I think the price was decent. There was no visible damage to the phone. I’d definitely buy a phone again from the seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I read the reviews and was kinda skeptical to order from them at first but I did anyway and I am extremely happy with my order. My phone looks practically brand new. It has no scuff marks, scratches, or anything. The sound quality of the pro and pro max (my wife has this one) is nowhere near that of the 11 itself, but that is an apple flaw. Anyway I am happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered this excellent condition phone and got a not so excellent phone. The screen had deep scratches under the new screen protector that was installed. The battery life was 78% (not the minimum of 80%). The seller wanted me to send pictures of the scratches and battery life of the phone they sent me. Too much confusion with this company. DON'T BUY FROM THEM!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got what I ordered for my boyfriends birthday present. Phone is in good condition but it was pretty dirty, would’ve been nice if it was clean."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was super skeptical about buying this phone because of all the reviews. But I needed one ASAP badly because my old phone was hanging on a thread. Anyway, it came in a timely manner. The phone has NO SCRATCHES or DENTS! It was pretty much like brand new. It came with a charger! Everything was perfect! I’m so glad I decided to buy from this seller despite the reviews!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I order the wrong model"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I don't blame the people who sell these items. I personally never owned an I phone and tried going the cheaper route so I'd say I'm the one to blame. The phone looked brand new for something that was used. Just returned because it wasn't what I wanted got my refund. Definitely need to be knowledgeable before purchasing bigger items like these. But it was great phone looked new and came with a charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","pretty cool phone I just had one issue with the camera half of it was pink I just reset the phone then it worked fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The only defect I was able to find was a little scratch on the screen (which I hate but with the screen protector you can't see it anymore, and they said that ""there are no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm's length"" so that was true), apart from that looks absolutely perfect. The battery came in 89% (not bad but not perfect), the description of the product says that I would come over 80% so they kept their word in that as well. I have been using it for a couple of days and everything works perfectly.I genuinely believe this was a good purchase.I suggest you to pay attention to the descriptions of the product, they explain the characteristics of the phone, the accessories and the box you are receiving and they do keep the promise.If you don't agree with the characteristics they are promising, just don't buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came packaged nicely and is working well. This is my first iPhone and so far I’m pleased with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything works great on this phone except for the fact that the alarm doesn’t work anymore. I am up at 4 AM every morning and the alarm has no sound. It doesn’t matter what ringtone or how loud I make it, it doesn’t work. I rely on it and I actually had to go and buy an alarm clock because my phone doesn’t work in this aspect. Disappointed. I had an iPhone 8 plus it was a few years old and I never had a problem with any of that."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’ve just received my order: an iPhone 11 pro, “renewed premium”, and was hoping I could leave a good review about the whole experience.However, I have to say I am very disappointed due to the conditions the cellphone came in - it seems it was poorly inspected. For being a “renewed premium”, I was expecting it to come in better physical conditions. As soon as I opened it, I realized it has some scratches in the camera frames, and the sticky plastic cover was dirty with hair, as though the cellphone had been unboxed many times. In addition, the battery health is 87%. I was expecting at least 90%, as the description says: “at least 90% battery life”. I think I was sent only a “renewed” and not a “renewed premium”.As a loyal Amazon customer, I request a proper solution for this problem.Please let me know if I need to provide further details. I did not find a way to contact the seller directly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sin detalles!! Excelente estado parece totalmente nuevo. Batería al 91%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It is really in good condition but second day I noticed that call volume is too weak. You are hearing something in so much low volume, you can not speak at the outside. Maybe you can hear something at home barely. I returned and waiting for refunding. I really wanted to have a phone like that in good condition. Sorry for refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I liked the features and the freshness of the phone. Easily handable and you can get used to it pretty easily"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Un producto restaurado de muy buena calidad ya he comprado uno anteriormente y tengo dos años y sigue funcionando sin ningún problema y sobre lo estético se miran como nuevos , creo q tienen un buen filtro de control de calidad. Compre en otro lugar por 20 dólares menos pero lo devolví por el mal estado q se miraba por fuera"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is just as the description. Battery was at 88%. I’ve been using it for 2weeks and all is going well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything was perfect, absolutely no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything is good but the battery life even though I charge it max everytime"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buyer beware, I would give a 0 star review if I could:My ""as new, renewed"" iphone 11 Pro arrived, shiny and beautiful looking like new, no scratches on body or screen, BUT: the screen was not attached to the phone properly, a big gap at the left side that I could see into and slide a nickel under.... phone also became nuclear hot within an instant of being pugged in to charge.... not a good sign... so I applied for a refund.... it did however have 87 % battery health, but not sure what that means if it is leaking radiation from heat and the phone body not being the original parts or sealed in any way....however, seller seems legitimate, they wanted to repair it or replace it initially, but quickly I lost my trust of second hand renewed phones and prefer to pay more for one that is new and comes with a year or more warranty... so, they issued my refund today for the full amount, apparently will land in my account in few days...BUT: they did not provide return shipping or a label when asked, so, contrary to Amazon policy, I had to pay 10 dollars for shipping and I am not being reimbursed this.. overall, a poor shopping experience and a waste of money and time.... also, the phone arrived in a cardboard box, no bubble wrap or protective packaging.... surprising for a 500 dollar item...Beware that these phones may seem like a good idea, but it may not be worth it in the long run."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got a nice iPhone 11 with no cracks or scratches. The only downside I can think of is that it is at 84% battery life but other than that it’s awesome. The seller is also very accommodating and helpful if you need anything or have any questions."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After reading some of the bad reviews and I was a little hesitant to buy from this vendor but decided to anyways. I'm glad I did. My phone is in great shape. It looked almost new. only one very minor smudge on the back. It was no big deal because I always use a case. The phone is in great working order and takes awesome pictures."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone, would buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I tough the tray for the sims card was missing but its there, beautiful phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’ve had no issues with this phone yet and it’s been well over a month since I’ve purchased. Solid investment"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","When I originally purchased the device, I was beyond excited. The phone arrived two days earlier than the expected delivery date and was in pristine condition for it being used. There were a few noticeable scratches on the corners of the phone but the screen and the cameras were not scratched at all. It also came with 85% battery life left. Overall I was incredibly happy with my purchase.

However, only after a month of use the display suddenly gave out. The phone was still working as I could use my Apple Watch to send and receive messages, however the screen was pixelated at first and then went completely dark a day later and did not turn back on.

Since I am still within my 90 day window I have requested a replacement device. I am a little frustrated since I am without a phone currently and my phone was suppose to arrive 7/14. The last two days I have received emails stating that my device will arrive later than originally expected and it still has not even shipped yet. I will be going out of town this weekend and was hoping to have a phone by then but it is looking like that won’t happen. Clearly have some disappointments.

Would love to have been able to rate 5 stars but I am hopeful that when I receive the replacement phone it will work better and last longer than the previous one. I will update my review after I have a chance to review the new device."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had to clean gunk out of the cracks and out of the speaker holes. It had clearly not been even remotely cleaned as there was food residue from someone’s fingers still ON the back. These random lines started appearing on the side of the screen after about a month of use and it is spreading more with time."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","everything that was said would be included, was included; the phone, a charger, the charger cube, some instructions, and a paperclip to remove the sim card from your old phone to the new phone. the battery life is at 86% which isnt bad. and they even put a screen protector on it!! overall, very happy with this purchase!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything was perfect. The battery was completely dead upon arrival would be my only complaint."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m in love with this phone!!! Was very awesome!!! Such an upgrade from at iPhone 8plus. Camera is amazing!! And then it’s been amazing!!! I have no complaints so far!!! Will update soon! But it’s been a good phone switched easy. No scratches no nothing that I seen!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is a step up from my 6 phone so a few new features to learn but so far so good. Good condition, love the color. And it told me when I had a spam call which was great. I have other refurbished items that are still serving me well - I expect this phone to be one as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No cosmetic defect visible on phone and screen. Everything works fine. Generic charger and adapter in the box which was expected. Only concern was Max battery capacity showing 90% during opening, a few weeks of usage Max capacity has now decreased to 88%. Thinking will have to change battery soon. Overall good buy thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","In great working condition, fast shipping"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone arrived neatly packed, with all the claimed accessories. It even had some of the original stickers which made it feel like I was the first person using this phone. Set up was very easy, no issues whatsoever, and the best part was that I did not have to wait for this package at all (super fast delivery). Amazing product, will be looking at this seller for future purchases.
Writing this review from my recently purchased iPhone 11 Pro Max. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was a little dirty when I got it. Definitely make sure you sanitize it. It came with a screen protector but I honestly believe that was to “mask” the scratches on the screen. Battery health is 88%. Overall I still think it was a decent buy to be a used phone. I would buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great product. My phone was received with no scratches and looks brand new. It also came with a screen protector already on it. It was unlocked and easy to set up."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone arrived a couple hours before it said it would. It’s in perfect condition! It freezes up from time to time but that could just be because my storage is full. HIGHLY recommend. My only complaint is that the battery only charges to 96% but the battery stops lasts about 6 hours when fully charged."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","it was only 500 bucks and it’s like brand new! the battery life is great, everything about it is great, the only thing is it didn’t come with an actual apple charger but nonetheless it’s a great deal and the phone is spectacular. i recommend for anyone who needs a quick phone or something. i love it so much!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Renewed with non genuine parts in my case it's the battery, I'm sure it's not because they want to but because of apple. it says vigorously tested on the package yet my speaker volume is extremely low and haven't been able to solve that through settings so you get what you pay for I guess"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone came in perfect condition looks new, its unlocked as described, came with cable and box for outlet to charge, seems to be working as expected but time will tell and I will update my responses then so far so good. Battery life at 90 percent. Face recognition works well just rework a lil time for it to read Apple Watch 6 but got it after resetting a couple times. I bought phones on Amazon before an this the only one CEO sends email of who to contact and making sure phone was perfect nice to know that if I need help I have link to contact with having to try to find them or having to go through Amazon return first."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is in good shape and everything works, however the max battery life is already depleted to the point of it telling you it needs to be replaced. If the phone was “refurbished” like it said that should have been taken care of… other than that it’s a good phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es un teléfono usado sin duda alguna, lo de casi nuevo en entredicho. Por un poco más hubiera podido comprar un nuevo, satisfacción 7/10."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I already had an iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB model that I bought the day it first came out at the Apple Store. I paid $1245 for that phone brand new, but I upgraded it to iOS 13.4.1 which made it incompatible with a game controller I’m using for streaming.For less than $980, I purchased a Renewed iPhone 11 Pro 512GB model from BuySpry which still has iOS 13.3.1 which works with my controller.So yeah I’m happy I got more storage capacity at a cheaper cost than my original phone. The screen looks great (no scratches / came with screen protector preinstalled) and the battery life is just as good as my original iPhone 11 Pro.The only caveats: (1) Doesn’t come with original box or accessories. (2) I can’t buy additional AppleCare coverage for this sweet device.Next time I upgrade I’ll probably get a bigger screen model iPhone (the Pro Max model).Thank you!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This seller is great very fast shipping guys I love them"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ordered two iPhone 11 Pros with 512gb memory. Two weeks in and phones are excellent. One came with 98% battery and one came with 85% battery. Each was near new. One had a screen crack that was perhaps 1mm, like someone poked it with a tack in the center. Both came with tempered glass protectors installed over the screens (probably coincidence). We are pleased"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good quality and in good condition for a refurbished phone. Really happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It got here earlier than it originally said!Phone looks great and everything works well so far.Happy with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Saw the first review giving one star and there isn't enough reviews to form a solid decisive at first glance. So yeah, I hesitated a little especially when it's a $1k purchase . With the iPhone presented as ""like new"" condition, I went with it knowing that Amazon got my back with the buyer protection program.Received the phone within a couple of days. Bam! Everything looked like new. Charging cable and EarPods looked untouched. Phone came with the sticker covering the screen so I peeled it off. Turned on the phone - everything worked. Battery health check showed 100%. Went to sprint store, got me a SIM card and activated this new iPhone.For some Apple enthusiasts, it may be a dealbreaker because this iPhone came with a generic phone box. To me, I don't give a ship as long as I get all the phone equipment.Anyway, I have this silver 512gb one for 2 weeks now. No complaints. Satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in 2 days early and i was gonna order a screen protector but the phone came with one on it already. The phone had no scratches anywhere on the phone and it looked brand new the battery health was at 98 percent which is way better then i thought it would be ive been using it for the past 3 days with no issues at all i highly recommend buying from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone works perfectly fine it came with no scratches but a few fingerprints on the screen that I cleaned off, battery life 100% perfect condition doesn’t lag or anything and I’ve waited 10 days to give this review. The only thing is just last night the charger that was provided burned while I was sleeping it burned my back and my bedsheet."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone itself is great with extremely minimal scuffing. My only complaint is the charger that came with the phone does not work basically at all. It is useless. Very happy with the phone. I purchased unlocked and it works with my Verizon SIM card."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It works perfectly and mi wife loves it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good phone! Battery life at 85% but that’s all my iPhone XR was at before switching and didn’t have many problems with it. That and a couple scratches around the edges are my only complaints- better than $450 for cracked ones on Facebook marketplace! I would buy another phone off here!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This Phone came in 1 week after buying. I was a little skeptical but it came like brand new. There is some scratches but they are not visible. The only downside is the battery came in at 84% but it’s not that bad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A huge disappointment. I understood that buying a refurbished phone could be a risk, but I figured that it should be pretty safe in this case, being on Amazon and having a bunch of good reviews. Big mistake on my part.I started setting up the phone the very same day I received it. During the set-up, the phone kept spontaneously shutting down, but I figured this had to do with the fact I was in the lengthy process of transferring my information from an Android phone. This continued for *literally* hours until I finally gave up and decided not to transfer ANYTHING from my old phone just so that I could set up this new one. The spontaneous shut-downs continued until, by the end of the night, the phone would not even power on again.At this point, I knew that I should just return the phone, but according to the seller’s directions, you must perform a factory reset on the phone before sending it back. I couldn’t do this because I couldn’t even turn the phone on at all! I contacted Apple support, and I couldn’t remotely reset it because I didn’t have an Apple computer. So, I had to make an appointment at the Apple Store just so they could factory reset it for me so I could send it back and get my $1000 back.This was in all honesty an absolute nightmare to deal with. A financial risk because it was such a huge purchase (especially to risk getting stuck with once it was broken), and a huge waste of my time (the whole ordeal spanned nearly 2 weeks) trying to set up, then chatting with Apple support, then having to go to the store to reset, then finding a way to send back.Tl;dr: a nightmare of an experience, would NOT recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Such a good phone. I was very nervous about buying this phone. However there were no problems! The battery health was at 100% when i got it. Transferring all the data from my old iphone was very easy but took about 3 hours. It also shipped very fast like less than a day. And it came in 3 days. Took a while to activate the phone but It is very worth the money and time."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My phone arrived 2 days after my purchase. I set the phone up and have been using it for 48 hours with no issues. The condition was like new. The battery life is excellent. Phone was sent with an after market charger and generic box. I am pleased with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Amazing phone came in perfect condition no scratches no nothing everything works great battery life is AMAZING.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was kind of leery in purchasing a used phone, but decided that the price was affordable and an upgrade to my IPhone 6 (right). This phone has been amazing and the new features I can do (wireless charging for one). I would recommend this product and the seller as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love the new stuff iPhone and the one offer to get like that never happened thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bien cuidado esta como nuevo sin ningun golpe"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got one of the two switched over wife hasn’t got hers switched yet very happy with mine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came perfect, only one issue is when I get a call and put the phone to my ear the screen would bank out and would not respond. Other than that it was ok, wish someone would have reached out to get the issue resolved but no one did"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not the best first impression. Box was torn, protective film on the phone had been removed and had finger grease all over it. Camera lenses had adhesive covering them. I cleaned it all up and transferred everything over and it seems to function 100% with 87% battery health. Just seems like someone else had gotten this phone then returned it and Amazon just sent it to me. I paid $70 extra for the “Amazon Premium” renewed phone too."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in good condition. Battery life was only at 92 %"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had to buy an older iPhone since my brand new iPhone 12 (5G) (Verizon) would constantly drop calls - this is a known issue at Apple and Verizon on model 12. I even switched to a 4G/LTE sim card to try and fix the issue - nothing I was told to do by Verizon worked.Frustrated, I purchased this iPhone 11Pro, put the 4G sim card in and it’s worked flawlessly - just like my old iPhone 6S Plus.I then sold my 12 for much less but at least my issue is now fixed.The camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is so much better than the 12 (see “moonset” image) Aside from a few minor scratches, it’s like having a new iPhone. I’m satisfied with this purchase. Hope this helps."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Las esquinas del celular se encontraban con daños significativamente apreciables, llegó demasiado sucio en los bordes, micrófono y parlantes, con una mugre color negra muy difícil de limpiar. Parecía carbón. El cable y el cargador de muy mala calidad. La batería se encontraba en un estado normal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La camara funsiona bien y la bateria esta al 100% puedo grabar mis videos en alta calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The camera is outstanding."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","phone came in generic box without original pakaging or accessories. this wouldn't have mattered at all really but I'm just building up to it. so first of all, I've alway been an android person and never really cared much for apple, but because I never tried it and if it's not broken dont fix it. I mean a smartphone is a smartohone right? wrong, after using my girlfriends old iPhone cuz my phone broke the its simple quality of life improvements that sets apple apart. it's not always as intuitive as you want it to be but it's easy to learn. I was so use to having a back button and a home button. but back to my story, after unboxing I load up my sim card and turn on the phone, logo pops up and powers down right away. so turns out it's not charged... great, whatever. it's been refurbished, that acceptable. no big deal... as I'm charging the iPhone I snap a few photos and show my gf then sweet upgrade. she says why did I get the older model. she says that's not the new iphone... it's actually an iPhone 7 or 8 I believe. but after verifying for myself and double checking the receipt she was right. battery is slightly charged now so i turn on the phone again. I go thru the set up only to find that the phone is still locked to a previous owner and there's no ICCID number... even with sim card in, looked online and everyone said it's a bricked iPhone maybe someone previously tried to 'jailbroken' and bricked it. so now I'm here weiting this review trying to contact the seller before I formally request a refund/return. how does this happen? obviously I knew that ordering something used or refurbished could potentially have risks, but I was thinking, like a small scratch or something.. really fckin crazy that I ended up getting a locked older model. please can you guys double check your orders and maybe find out if I was sent someone elses order. indont see how this happens even with coronavirus going on. if anymore info is needed please email me!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased the phone for use on vacation. I took an island hopping trip in the Philippines. The phone is most definitely a good phone for water sports. I used it in both fresh and saltwater without any issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased it for my great grandson Christmas gift and he seems to like it. But that was a lot of money for an old phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was received in a sealed original factory box. There were zero scratches or defects in the screen or the body. Phone charged to 100% and works like a new one. Battery life is right on par with new as well. Very good for a renewed phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The device is pretty nice. Didn't come in the original box but the device itself had no damage or scratches, almost like new. The only problem is the charger (generic and certified) after 6 days it started making a noise. It does not happen all the time but I might have to get a new one. Also, the battery life was at 90%. Other than that I'm very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend the seller and the products"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came in Great condition, with 95% battery health. Passed 3uTools verification tests. Midnight Green Body was shiny and new, very slight screen marks in correct light but new as can get. True Tone, Face ID etc all works. Only annoying thing was cleaning off the glue from the wrapping and there being no sim card tool, but i had one at home. 9.5/10 Very Happy with the buy ( :"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received the iPhone in a non-Apple box, which I don't care for. The content is in excellent condition. You can't ask for more as a ""renew, recertified"" iPhone. I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I phone was great except it got scratches in bottom corner, almost feel like someone was forcing it an I phone case and it went down. Works fine, I will think about wait one day of it bothers me so much I may end up returning them in 3 days"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is pretty decent, the battery health was 86% but there were scratches all around the corners of the phone probably caused by a case, there was also a scratch on the screen but it’s barely noticeable, other than that I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone works as good as new, battery is good, it actually came unlocked and very clean"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is 100% worth the money and will last me years to come. It works like brand new & was promptly shipped in time! Packaged nicely with charger too :) very happy with my purchase & recommend it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Parece nuevo todo funcional"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Package Came in 2 days early. Phone is in excellent condition and Battery Health is 97%. For Me it was definitely worth buying. Very satisfied with the purchase. 👌🏾"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this phone as a gift for my wife (who really needs a new phone). Sprung for the unlocked version of the phone in ""Excellent Condition."" Amazon defines that as follows: ""Cosmetic condition: Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away)."" Certainly would've been OK with some mimimal scratches and nicks to the outside of the phone. But its screen, which came with a not well-applied screen protector on it (big bubble in the middle of the screen, so I had to remove it), is scratched maybe more than any phone screen I've ever seen. Like someone rubbed fiberglass across it over and over. Microscratches cover the whole thing. Comical in way. One scratch? Probably woulda kept it. Two? OK, sure. I'm buying a refurbished phone. I get it. 100+? Did the previous owner line his pockets with sandpaper or something?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Arrived a day early that was first great thing everything seems to be good, battery is not holding as long as expected other than that great product clean zero blemishes I would use seller again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No sound, speaker sometimes not working, many times visit apple store but no help. All garbage. Do not buy and beware of fraud."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great seller, fast shipping, excellent customer service. Product was as described, great condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Product was nice"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this to replace my iPhone 7 bc the it stopped charging. Transfered everything smoothly and it’s still working well"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","para ser un dispositivo restaurado funciona perfecto y sin imperfecciones el estado seria una A, lo mejor de todo es que viene desbloqueado para poder utilizarlo en todo el mundo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Screen is popping off on all the edges. Leaving big air pockets, making it very difficult to use those parts of the screen. The rest of the phone is exclent!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My first review was in error, my husband is very happy with his phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It was delivered 2 days sooner than expected which was nice! I’m always cautious when buying refurbished phones. but this is my second time doing so through amazon and I am pleased. My silent switch doesn’t work but there are ways to work around that in settings. My phone arrived with 90% battery health then went down to 87% but I’m now back at 90%. People have trouble hearing me when i’m using speaker phone with a case on. I usually use earbuds when on the phone so this doesn’t bother me much. all small inconveniences which can be easily worked around. over all happy with the phone !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It’s been about a month since I made my purchase and the battery life that I received was 87%, there was no scratches no dents no visible marks on the cell phone to be honest I’m really happy with the purchase and I would definitely recommend using the Amazon premium renewed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The product very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo de acuerdo a lo esperado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So the device I ordered was renewed. It was stated to be in “Excellent” condition. To quote two of the bullets in the description:This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.This product will have a battery that exceeds 80% capacity relative to new.I disagree with both of these as shown in my pics/screenshots. Also, the screen honestly as pristine and even tiny scratch free (that I get from my purse & pockets) as it was, combined with the teeny bubbles in the back I assume the screen was previously replaced. I have taken enough items to the Apple Store for repairs to know that if they open it and find third party repairs have been made they won’t work on it.This phone had a battery status of “service” so below the 80% stated. Not worth the hassle of maybe trying to get it replaced and finding out Apple won’t do it. I returned it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The condition of the phone was great but the battery heath came with only 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Honestly coming from a guy that has been in the iPhone family all his life I would say this is a really good deal had really no problem except for the audio from taking video bug out on me a couple times but other than that there has been absolutely nothing else wrong no scratches no design flaws great quality great battery life 100% btw and although I would prefer y’all to get the smaller model cause paying a extra 100 for the larger model seem a little off and I just like the smaller one better it seems more premium to me and bigger is not always better when it comes to phones the smaller one seem big to me anyways"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have had zero issues with this phone. It works perfectly! I was a little Leary bc if all the bad reviews. I’m glad I bought it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Finger print scanner didn't work, otherwise was as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I debated for weeks before buying this IPhone, for fear of buying a dud, but, finally took everyone's advice and gave it a try. I love it. It's one of the best buys of my life. It's battery is full 100%, I can find no problems with it and love being able to Facetime with family and friends around the world, it's like being with them for awhile. I truly love this phone, it's so easy to learn and use and the battery is so long lived that I'm not constantly charging it. Anyone debating trying a refurbished phone can use my advice and think about it positively."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My iPhone 8 died suddenly and with supply chain issues and back orders I would've had to wait for Verizon to get new phones to buy. In a pinch I ordered this and took a chance because it's not cheap. It arrived a day earlier, packaged nicely and at least 90 percent charged. I switched the sim cards and it's been a life saver ever since."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Dislike low battery life, good face recognition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bueno pero la batería está muy baja"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this phone for my 17 year old and it’s the second iPhone purchase we’ve made from amazon. Works like new and so much more affordable than thru the providers long term! It came neatly packaged and he had his phone swapped over in less than 5 minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I used Android phone and needed to update my phone. Wife has iPhone x so decided to try iPhone 11 as well as Samsung Android phone.Not sure what is so special about the iPhone but the way it is architected is horrible. I want to own my data and not have it in the cloud. iPhone defaults to saving everything in their cloud so reconfigured that. Tried to search for a picture and there are no directories (I thought what kind of rubbish is this).Android is not the best OS but at leas it is architected like a real system. I will continue with an Android phone.Just to add, I have returned this item and Amazon received the item on a certain date. It is going to be a month in 5 days and still no refund by Amazon. I do not like that they are holding onto my money for so long. I do hope I get my refund or I will have to raise an issue with them."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone looks good, no cosmetic damage. Only thing to be aware about is Battery Health and Cycle Counts."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 I bought this phone for nearly $700 and it was listed as ""new"", however it came in an after market box, with an after market charger that didn't even work. However, the real concerning problem is the minor issues I've had with the phone itself since getting it. Apps constantly crash, or completely won't even open (example shown in attachment, and unfortunately they will only let me post one video per review I have tons of examples of everything happening). The screen constantly glitches, sometimes with even a purple-ish pixelated color. Today the phone completely spazzed out and logged me out of every thing, including my Apple ID and deleted all of my messages, and will now not let me receive or make FaceTime calls. I've contacted Apple Suport and they just suggested I do a software update, but the phone will not let me download the update and neither space nor wifi is the issue. I also contacted the seller, but after reading the reviews and people saying the seller never got back with them I felt I should write a review as well, and I'm usually one to never do this. If you're thinking about buying a phone or anything else from this seller, I highly recommend that you DON'T. I was naive and assumed the issues would just eventually resolve itself, I also didn't want to admit I may've wasted nearly $700 on a dud, but they are gradually getting worse and worse, and I'll probably just have to suck it up and get a new phone or hope that GeekSquad or something can help resolve the issue."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone on Amazon shows up as refurbished but it is basically brand new, only a few minor acratches on the side. Overall this phone is worth the money."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Iphone for all reason it worked real good at first and now it doesn't work properly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estéticamente impecable, pero el lado izquierdode la pantalla no funcionaba. Tuve que devolverlo y comprarme otro, y hace 7 días que llegó mi devolución y sigo esperando a que procesen mi reembolso. Todo mal.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","todo excelente solo llego"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al principio estuve con un poco de miedo porque no había comprado nunca un teléfono caro y mucho menos que haya sido reacondicionado, pero, sin dudas, ha sido una gran compra.

Felicitaciones a los distribuidores de Hibryd IT, épico el celular! Luce como nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","bought this for our son for he had to have the latest phone. so far so good. Not had any issues yet and we gave it to him for Christmas. it was easy to set up and made his own apple account so he can use it own his own. So far he likes it and uses it everyday"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","When I first opened the phone it came on as a Verizon carrier (the product description indicated that it was fully unlocked for all carriers, and we needed At&T). I put in the SIMS card from the old 7 (upside-down was the only way it would go in ). Still, came up as Verizon. I shot out an email to TRADEMORE asking for help. Meanwhile, I went into iTunes to download what we managed to save. When all the updates and uploading were completed the phone indicated our AT&T carrier. I wrote to TRADEMORE once again to say we had it figured out. They responded the next day. The phone has worked perfectly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone arrived in like-new condition, despite being renewed. There was no previous sign of use. The battery lasts me over a full day of use on a single charge, often seeing over 7 hours of screen-on time, several of which are on maximum brightness while outdoors (which the screen remains remarkably visible in). The battery also arrived at 100% capacity, so it is brand new.

I've been very happy with my purchase considering the software and hardware improvements from the 6S that it is replacing.

Did I mention it came with a screen protector already on it? Not a single scratch on the housing or screen of the phone. Save yourself a few hundred dollars, buy the phone renewed. If you get a bad one from the bunch, just exchange it - returns are free."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this for my daughter 5 months ago now and we have not had a single issue. It works perfectly. Came packaged great with a charger. Worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","In general, everything is very good, I will have to send it to a cleaning service, even inside due to how covered the speakers and the microphone are with dirt."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone looks new no scratches or blemishes just wish it was a better battery life. Phone came at 81% battery life. My daughter likes it so I’m happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was a bit wary at first trying Amazon Renewed with these insanely expensive flagship phones, but with the 90 day return window and the battery and condition guarantees I figured what did I have to lose?I purchased a Galaxy S10 for myself first and I was so pleased with it I got my dad this iPhone 11 Pro soon after.I much prefer Android overall personally but when my dad's iPhone 11 Pro showed up I couldn't help but be a bit envious.The cameras and camera software are amazing. And there's something about holding the device in your hand that just exudes quality. It feels so premium and so well made.If you're wondering about picking up this phone from Amazon Renewed, don't hesitate."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A veryy small scratch but no big deal as long as the phone works thats all that matters... also very happy with the seller because he added screen protector temp glass 😍😍😍😍. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone works good, only issue the speakers don’t work that well! Sounds like it went through a washing machine. Hopefully easy cheap fix"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I thought the battery life was going to be better, the health said it was at 90 after spending almost $700 I expects a new battery but it gets through about a day and a half with out charging."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got my new phone in today and was super disappointed to find that my phone was at 87% battery capacity when amazon renewed ""guaranteed"" a MINIMUM of 90% other that that everything was okay"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was skeptical about the product's relatively low cost, but the phone is fantastic! I received the color and carrier I wanted, and I'm very satisfied! However, the phone was at 10% battery when you turn it on, and the included charger looked old and a little dirty. Overall, there were only a few minor inconveniences, but it's still a great product nonetheless."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Mint condition like it said and no problems with phone, Been using for 2-3weeks now with no complaints and easy connection to my service . Great Buy! Would definetly buy agiain!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nice and clean and everything things work"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone arrived on time and in exceptional condition. The notes say it was handed to a person or receptionist. That was inaccurate because it was delivered to a home and left outside the door."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone had alot of scratches around the frame, but the battery health is at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Still getting used to phone but enjoy fully functional phone now……"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is good for the price. The battery last not much and the speaker when you take a call… the sounds come up distorted. (So i an using it with the EarPods)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like Apple products, but they’re expensive. So, I’ve gotten into the habit of buying refurbished and a couple years old. No problems at all with mine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got the apple iPhone 11 Pro no issues, phone looks brand new, unlocked just as stated, camera works excellent. So far I would say this was a excellent buy. Will update if there are any issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","At first I was a little skeptical because of the comments I read, but overall one of my best purchases so far. There wasn’t a scratch on the lens, screen or anywhere on the phone which was my biggest fear. Also, the battery life was at 97% which I thought was great since most refurbished phones come at low 90’s %. I’ve been using this phone for a little over a week and so far so good. Great response time and no lag. I’ll be back to give an update in a couple."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone. Arrived in one piece with no scratches. Was easy to set up with my straight talk plan. Been using it for a few months now and pretty happy. The only issue I had was with FedEx and that’s no reflection on the seller since FedEx in my area is a total mess this summer. I love my phone with its huge storage. I have the 250-ish storage and my old phone was 32gb so I can take as many photos as I want. Very happy :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone. Bad battery life. This is my 6th IPhone. Unfortunately they only last 2-3 years before needing to be replaced. Their batteries are TERRIBLE always in need of recharge"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","autonomía de la batería muy buena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Absolutely zero issues with this phone. Came with a screen protector and charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Still learning."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Have had for a few weeks now. Battery lasts two days almost. I did give 4 stars because I am overall satisfied but sometime my screen does freeze up. I have to lock phone then unlock and completely close app and reopen for it to work. Has became a little bit of a pain since I use my phone a lot for work. But everything else is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The product unfortunately did not come in the original box, but if you read the product description before buying you would know that they did mention some orders would come without that option. They did provide a charger though. For a “renewed” Product this phone was delivered in great condition. There were no scratches nor cracks on my iPhone 11 Pro everything worked perfect from the camera options to just basic browsing. Battery came in at 100% health. Set up was simple. Face-ID works, definitely not a fake phone because the App Store is from APPLE where as fake phones take you to an android App Store and there are other ways you can tell a fake from an original apart."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cumplió las expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La bateria muy baja"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Optimal condition, the battery is not 100% but its a refubrished phone is what it is, i would recomend 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En perfecto estado, funciona a la perfección, solo que los datos de repente no los agarra bien no sé si sea por la señal porque llamadas se reciben u salen perfectamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Didn’t use face recognition sign in featue. But works great was easy to set up with my Tracfone SIM card."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","siempre he comprado telefonos Sansung en Amazon Renewed y siempre viene 10/10 esta vez con Iphone 11 pro la calidad del mismo no me parece mucho, aunque no se ve mal si siento un producto de menor calidad en base a calidad / precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Setup was simple although it took a while to complete, phone was charged when I received it, setup easy cloning my old iPhone. It looked and worked like a new not a refurbished phone.Delivery was fast and package was in good shape when it arrived.It came with a generic cord and ac charger plug, I have not used either as I have several others."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was so excited to finally get a new phone, I was looking forward to Midnight Green as it's one of my favorite colors. I GOT SPACE GREY. Yes. Wrong Color. Very disappointed. I didn't want to hassle with an exchange or return so I decided to just deal with it. It also said AT&T on the box even though I ordered for T-Mobile.The phone itself is in great shape, no scratches or marks on it. It looks brand new even though it is renewed. The Tech guy at the T-Mobile store was able to activate it and transfer all my stuff to it without any issues even though it said it is a AT&T phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have to say that it this iPhone looks great! The only reason I wouldn’t give it a 5 star is because the SIM card slot is not perfectly flush when closed. This makes me concerned about the waterproofing of the phone. I would not trust it’s waterproofing, that’s why I don’t give it full honors."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto exactamente lo que se alista"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had brought the same iPhone 11 Pro from kiss electronic Inc through Walmart. it was damaged. that’s why I returned that phone.But when I ordered the same phone from kiss electronic inc through Amazon. I got a phone just like new. I found everything is okay. I don’t know why?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life sucks. Get what ya pay for. Phone in good condition tho"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No funciona bien la cámara cuando abro la cámara empieza a temblar y ase un ruido estraño adentro voy a tener que regresarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Been using the 11 pro for the past week or since I've gotten it and everything works fine. Battery life is 97% and the only cosmetic defect I notice is a 1 cm long scratch near the bottom of the screen that is barely noticeable. It came with a screen protector already and a charger.So far I'm batting 2/2 on Amazon Renewed and I look to be buying more products from them in the future. Prime shipping + 3 month return window is just too good a combo, especially with how easy Prime returns are if you have a Kohls nearby."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I recently ordered the iphone 11 pro. When I recieved the phone I was very excited and happy because upon further review everything worked good. I went in to my carrier to pick up a SIM card and found out I was unable to. The lady did everything she could but said the pre-existing account had never been canceled. She had to factory reset my phone and it still did not work. Very disappointed and let down. Read the risks before ordering."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","battery health came 88% but the charge holds good for right now! The phone came with a glass screen protector when I took it off it had a few scratches and smudges that feel permanent. Other than that everything else is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is my very first review ever. I was very skeptical about purchasing this device based on the mixed reviews. I want to say my phone is perfect looks brand new. I want to give it 5 stars. However, I am leaving only 4 due to the fact that the battery life is only 91%. I expected 95% or more."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this renewed phone is. Some reviews scared me a bit but what I received is very nice"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Vida útil de batería 91%Llegó con un cargadorNo tengo ninguna queja.Lo volvería a comprar sin ningún problema"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo está muy bien tiene buenas funciones no estaba dañadoMe encantoAun que no traía el cargador original funciona bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Like it all"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in and it looked brand new, it just had a tiny scratch at the very bottom. It’s not really noticeable unless you’re like looking for it. Other than that was very pleased with the quality of the phone. Highly recommend!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estabamos muy nerviosos de la compra pero todo resulto excelente estetica de 9.9 el celular. ningun rayon,Todo lo que se menciona : cargador generico, cable generico, no bloqueado. y bateria con vida util de 86%En general muy contentos con nuestra compra y recomendamos a el proveedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this iphone by mistake but the phone is perfect, i return the item and I get my money back, best seller thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Huge upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus. Love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me agrado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Recibí el teléfono. Se ve en muy buenas condiciones, pero solo me llegó el teléfono y el cable. No recibí el enchufe"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Absolutely satisfied with buying this phone. It looks brand new and what makes it even better is it came with a glass screen protector already on it. It also came way earlier expected! Highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It works perfectly, but the outside has many imperfections."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone is in excellent “cosmetic” condition but no one can hear me on the other line of the phone. Can’t use a phone where no one can hear me 🤷🏽‍♀️ Returning"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love the phone the camera system is amazing the phone is 512G I recommend this phone I purchased 2 I will absolutely buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the midnight green iPhone 11 Pro. They delivered it three days earlier than they said they would deliver it. The phone looks great, and so far it well works very well. It came with a charger cord and adapter(not original apple cord or adapter but it works fine). I like how they sent it with a screen protector on the phone, but there is scratch like thing under it. The phone’s maximum battery capacity is 100%, which is more than I expected. Overall, I am very happy with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m not sure if I am out of my warranty date since it’s refurbished but there’s just some things that are not working as they should (sound) for the most part"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I feel like since I paid this much money for it, it could’ve been almost like new. My phones having problems with the touch screen . It’s either dragging(slow) or won’t work at all when I try and exit out of something etc. it’s not like I can send the phone back because this is all I have to communicate with families and friends during this stressful time, so what can I do about the screen being more up to date or working better when it comes to the touch.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After getting my iPhone X wet on the lake this summer I was freaking out. I didn't want to purchased a new phone through my carrier and have the additional fees added to my bill. So I decided to do my research, and stumbled across this buyer. I was worried that the phone would come in pretty rough shape. To my surprise it came in very mint condition. I. was able to get the higher Gb iPhone at a fraction of the price. What's great about this company is its backed by a warrantee if anything is wrong with the phone just send it back. Needless. to say I'm really happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Arrived with 3 very small scratches on the screen that aren’t super noticeable but they are definitely there. Did not come with any of the original Apple packaging and the packaging that it did come in seemed insignificant for such a fragile and expensive device - thankfully it arrived undamaged but I would buy with caution. Otherwise, it seems to work as well as a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Okay so the only reason I’m not rating this higher is that there are micro scratches in the top right portion of the screen, and while the seller makes no mention of condition on their product page it would’ve been nice to know what I was getting myself into. Other than that the phone is in near prestine condition on the body and back glass plus, it’s nothing a screen protector can’t cover"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was amazing. Was weary buying a refurbished phone but there was not a single scratch on the phone and it came in just 2 days after ordering it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The product for the most part was in mint condition. Face ID won’t let me set it up but other than that the product works great! Definitely great for the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bien empacado, trae cargador y cable generico, esteticamente perfecto, 100% funcional, bateria al 88% muy bien para el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It ordered two for me and my wife. I have Verizon and she has Sprint. It worked great for me but for her not so well. The first one she tried it wouldn’t activate and she took it to sprint and they flagged the phone as stolen because it had two IMEI numbers, I got it replaced through Amazon and it happened again so we had to return hers. Mine still works very well but it apparently does not work for sprint."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It arrived very quickly, and it appeared to be a brand new product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Overall, great phone. My only issue with it is that the battery health came at 88%. Other than that, great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","For the price of this phone i’d recommend it to anyone, especially refurbished. Runs and looks like it’s brand new, And there was no scratches at all!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No problems no issues. Charger works. Phone came in great conditions. Everything works. I’m happy 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not what I had planned on from and iPhone 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The quality of the phone and space at this price, was a great deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great product for a good price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this phone for my nephew. Initially the speaker was not working properly and my nephew tried to get it replaced but they didn't have the speaker and advised him to buy an ear pod to use with phone. He bought the ear pods and was using them. The phone started to make a noise each time he was on a call. The noise kept getting louder each time. I tried to get him to return the phone but he wanted to see I'd the noise would stop. He eventually went home to Jamaica with the phone. Now the phone is completely useless. It has overheated and stopped working and even damaged his Sim card.They refuse to give us a refund and it's only been 2 months!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Impressed with the great condition and physical appearance of the cellphone. Set up easy and almost seamless. Very pleased with this acquisition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was in great shape. It came with a screen protector on it and when I took it off, the screen did have some very small scratches but with a new screen protector on, you can’t even see them. Remember - you are buying a REFURBISHED phone like the ad says."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Really great purchase 🙌🏾 No issues so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good deal and amazing service!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me agrado mucho la forma de atención al cliente.Fue bien rápido el revolcó.👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was SUPER nervous purchasing the iPhone 11 Pro 512GB due to the reviews. However, I’m extremely happy I went with my gut feeling & brought it because the phone came with no scratches. It works & looks as if brand new. It’s completely unlocked (Carrier Lock: no SIMS restricted) and the battery health is at 96%. (Though once fully charge, I can go the whole day without charging it). I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought phone as a Christmas present for my wife. Phone ear speaker does not function properly. At max volume, you can bearly hear the speaker. Headphones and out-loud speaker is fine.Wife is disappointed, we'll return it once we return from vacation."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No problems at all, literally exactly the same experience as a brand new iPhone. Zero complaints. Came in two days. Easy to register to metro by T-Mobile, took 15 minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","overall good product no issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto ninguna falla ni detalle a la vista"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone physically wise is fantastic. No cracks. That’s where it ends. The speakers are terrible quality. The phone screen was good but internally was botched. Had to pay $140 to get it fixed not even 24 hours in owning it. I ordered 2. Haven’t opened other but I will be hoping it isn’t the same deal. Just got a call, the audio is actually SUPER terrible and will have to be replaced. Will have to see if other phone I got is as terrible or if I simply got a sour apple"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery level is at 100%, and is in mint condition, very happy. Excellent price and even better phone.Came with charger and cable, no earpods.Highly recommendOne thing to note; I purchase this in June (this phone was release around October) and Apple typically offers a 1 year warranty (which is transferable), which mean there should be a few months of warranty left but there isn't. Something to be aware of."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone showed up quickly and is in excellent condition. Absolutely no scratches, there was some sticky residue on one edge that cleaned off easily, and it already had a screen protector (former owners gift to me). The only negative at all was that the battery Maximum Capacity is already down to 90%, but that was expected and explained in the description. I purchased the Fully Unlocked phone and it works perfectly with AT&T so far. I would highly recommend as a great alternative to buying new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came with a great (85%) charge, it does have a minor scratch on the screen but I dont notice it nor does it interfere with anything. My phone came with a cheap screen protector on it. I did remove that and put my own privacy screen protector on it. The set up to my cell phone provider was no problem and so far I have been very very happy with my Iphone 11 Pro."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","As expected, no scratches ..looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","the screen i very scratched , battery capacity was ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love that it came with no scratches and the cameras are flawless. The battery health came at 100% too which is awesome!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in a good condition, no scratches or damages. Battery life is good so far and the phone was unlocked as indicated in purchase details."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buena la compra , era mi primera vez comprando en línea y en esta plataforma sin embargo me precio una buena compra solo que tenía 84 por ciento de condición de batería. Del resto todo muy bien , el teléfono como tal está perfecto sin rayones. Me lo traje a Ecuador y funciona correcto todo, tanto SIM como el teléfono. Me vino una mica gratis con el cargador y el objeto de sacar el chip."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","799?! What a deal for 512gb, pro camera and a flawless phone with 100 percent battery health. I will never buy new iPhones again. I also bought a renewed MacBook Air from the same seller and it is flawless too. Never again will I buy new apple products. I returned my new iPhone 12 mini that cost 200 dollars more with no widescreen lens and terrible battery life.Don’t think twice about renewed. Keep your money and get great tech that is indistinguishable from new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","85% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo unico es que vino con 86% de condicion de bateria de ahi todo perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenia mucho desgaste en la parte de atras y rayas en la cámara"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen equipo, protegido y serio en el envío"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Según lo descrito, estoy contento con el producto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","so far is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","While there were no scratches or dings on the phone’s surface, there is definitely something wrong with the display. The colors have a bluish tone, and when turning the brightness down there are vertical lines all across the screen. That being said, 2 days in there have been no issues so far with phone functionality, battery life, camera, etc. I’m keeping it because I will probably be upgrading to the 13 anyway, but now that I’ve noticed the display flaws they are really difficult to ignore. If you are visually picky, or just on your phone a lot, I would shop somewhere else."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It takes time to get to use this iPhone compare to Android. And while learning and setting this iPhone the battery does not last more than half of the day"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I never leave reviews, but this phone for the value was great. I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews. Yes this is a refurbished phone, but at an arms length it looks brand new. Works just like new too, so glad I took the chance and bought it. Battery was at 97% so more then enough life ! Small little scratch on the bottom of the screen, can’t even tell unless you are looking for it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is great , i got the color silver, it works great it has no problems, the cameras work amazing the phone is in good shape. But the sides of the phone has a bit of scratches but they are not too noticeable on my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone was in excellent condition. First day battery overheated and has had inconsistent battery life since. Most days phone will last for whole day and a half with light usage, but if you’re using your phone significantly as I do for work then it’s less than a day for sure. Overall the product is a good, enjoy the camera quality and face recognition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life 84%.... NOT GOOD for the Price ... the iPhone it's in good shape except the batteryI brought it as a Christmas present to relatives in Brazil... I had to change the battery at Apple Store... very disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The Bluetooth wasn’t connecting"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered green, I received the graphite color but I liked the color as well so I over looked that. Immediately, I noticed the speaker sounded blown out and very low. It’s only gotten worse. It sounds like my phone is under 20 blankets and coming from an Alien signal. I would return but I literally received this the day I was moving and I don’t know where I put the box. Next time I think I’ll just spend the extra money at the apple store."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was worried with the reviews but this phone is flawless, had it for almost a couple weeks now. Came with a screen protector already on it so that was a plus (Might not be included for all of them). Aside from the packaging, I could hardly tell it’s not brand new. Battery was at 98% efficiency. I might be a little biased since I went from the 7 to 11 pro, but this is an awesome phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very happy with my purchase. I received exactly what I ordered, an IPhone 11 Pro 64 GB in midnight green. The battery came in at 100% which was awesome! The two negatives were the screen had a few scratches, one very noticeable the others not bad. Second is the box came in slightly crushed, thankfully everything was ok. Shipping was fast and even came a day early."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works great haven’t got any issue. Definitely recommended"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iPhone 11 ProA+ Looks New. Works PerfectNo visible scratches or imperfections!Will update accordingly if anything happens. It’s only been two days. Works flawlessly"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Littler higher on price side but well maintained. Good quality without any defects ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The condition of your phone will depend on the seller. My seller, BuySpry, provided me with a nearly mint condition device. Except for some extremely faint scratches on the edges the phone was perfect. At the time of this review the 11 pro is also a relatively new device so, most of the renewed products should be decent. The iPhone I received even had 5 months of AppleCare left.YMMV. I was fully expecting to receive a phone with ""minimal"" defects as opposed to the near mint one I actually received. Basically, you should expect to receive a product based on the description."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this product as a work phone. Outside the camera not being as I would have expected(I’m not writing a review based on that) the phone showed up with scratch marks on it which were highly visible. It had one small dent that was minuscule. The battery life from the get go was worse than my iPhone XR. Overall everything else works as expected. I feel it deserves a 3-4 star. If returning it wasn’t such a hassle I would have and spent the extra money for a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone is extremely delicate. Scratches easily. Other than that it’s ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I would upload photos but I am way too lazy for that, but I would like to say the phone was in great condition. The battery health is at 97% you can't beat that! the phone works fine and I've had no complications at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Apple iPhone 11 Pro, 512GB, Silver - Fully Unlocked (Renewed), Final Price after discount was $899 purchased on Aug 14, 2020.

This phone was in very good condition and it was like new only, No scratch or dent on the body. Box contain a compatible charger (Not original apple charger). Seller will give a proper instruction in the box if you want to return the item."

The tracking number was created within 2 days of making the purchase, but only after I contacted the seller twice for a refund did they finally drop it off at a post office. (Yes, they sent by USPS...who still does that?)Product is great, as advertised, refurbed and not in original box, but I didn't buy the box, I bought the phone. Its genuine, and relatively flawless. 5 stars for product. 1 star for seller."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was in pristine condition and I’m typing on it now. The battery life is great so far, it was the perfect size for me and I hope it lasts me a long time! I use straight talk and picked a Verizon chip and so far so good! Very easy to set up. Great product! Only complaint is the shipping through USPS, and would recommend another option as my phone was a little late getting here."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No scratches or flaws! Came with a screen protector installed. Battery life at 97% Came a few days sooner than expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I liked the fact mine as perfectly fine, no icloud lock, face id is working, no scratches not cracks on the back nor front, good speakers and mic and over all amazing. the battery life is at 86 which isnt so bad for its price but i was a bit skeptical since the reviews werent the best but its mostly based off luck i guess"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Shipping was quick, no cracks or blemishes that I've noticed so far and my SIM card worked fine and transferred over with no problem. It didn't come in the original box or with original chargers, but it did have a screen protector on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The screen came with two noticeable scratches. It was difficult to see them with the screen protector but as soon as I took off them, it was very easy to see and it is still clear when the screen is on. Very disappointed with this purchase. If you order one, please make sure to check the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Device is having th problem , where it didn't pick up the calls . Product is not good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought a renewed phone Fulfilled by Amazon, and sold by BuySpry. Received it and it looked great. Then during setup discovered the ""TruDepth Camera is deactivated."" After an hour of my own troubleshooting and an hour with Amazon/Apple tech support, I was sent to the Apple Store. There I was told this phone's history says this issue has existed since at least 4 months prior to my purchase. So this was a known issue that they sold as ""works like new"". Without the TrueDepth camera you can't use Face ID.

Neither Amazon nor BuySpry was willing to replace the phone, I had to purchase a different one and request a refund for this one. Now I have to pay more for the next phone and I'm out all the time I spent trying to resolve this issue. Hopefully the next purchase goes better.

The moral of the story is, read through the reviews, BuySpry appears to have a history of selling defective phones in this listing. Make sure you buy from a different seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono lo traje a Ecuador, llego en un paquete que obvio no es la caja original, estuvo en óptimas condiciones, llegó con protector de pantalla y un cargador.
En serio les recomiendo a este vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone arrived in perfect condition. However, I waited one week later to activate it only to find out that the product was defective. I called Amazon customer service whom transferred me to Apple for support. Once I talked to Apple they advised me that the product wasn't under warranty and they sent me to Apple store. When I arrived there they trouble shooted and told me the product was defective. Amazon had replaced/repaired the phone with a screen that wasn't backed by Apple which caused audio issues. Phone can only be used on speaker phone. Apple sent the phone out for repair and provided me with a loaner phone. Had to take my phone to my service provider and pay activation fee on loaner phone because it couldn't be done online since the phone was unable to receive sms notifications. Too much hassle for the money I paid to Amazon. Online nor Representative gave me the option to obtain a replacement phone for free. It's holiday season so the turn around time for repair will be longer. Item has unauthorized Apple parts causing audio issues. Took phone to Apple store for repair and it wasn't able to be fixed. Store supplied me with a certified letter from Apple explaining why"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A lot of small screeching.. will return."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The charging port stopped working after a few weeks had to get a wireless charger but overall everything else seems to work."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La descripción dice que es un artículo renovado y no lo es solo reiniciaron el teléfono a la forma de fabrica estaba con la pantalla muy rayada además lleno de mugre y suciedad por todos lados"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is great. I have NOT tried out camera yet ( I will add to review if I find it faulty). It came with no scratches, it looks brand new. I’m glad I took a chance after reading some of the negative views.
I am beyond happy with purchase as of now.
If I don’t update review means iPhone still works great .
P.s I can not review facial recognition as I’m really not trusting of the intended purpose. I can vouch that the phone works great !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","all perfect 92% battery life, just like new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m a product design engineer as 20 years of experience. I agree with the overall quality level of the product. And I would like to recommend this choice of ‘Renewed Premium’ for others."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone is in good cosmetic condition and generally works well, but the sound is AWFUL. From calls to podcasts to music to ringtones, it sounds muffled, scratchy and tinny. For calls, it doesn’t matter if it’s on speaker or not. I thought it might have been my case covering the speaker, but have the same issue when the case is off. This is my second subpar refurbished phone purchase from Amazon (first from this seller). Lesson learned."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Complete!! Great condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This review is for a iphone 11 pro i purchased, after receiving it powered up and showed a battery life of 93%, i have owned the phone for a little over three months and now the battery wont fully charge and i'm getting a message to replace the battery, so i took it for a battery replacement and the Apple certified service tech said the screws are messed up and the last person who worked on it did damage to them. He also mentioned the screen would probably break if they try more to get the screws out. So be aware when purchasing an iphone from Amazon that the phone can be damaged with a bad battery. Never again"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Telefone veio em perfeito estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excellent phone! It works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo excelente con excepción de la batería, sin embargo está por encima del 80% tal y como establece el sitio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like the camera most, actually that is why I got the iPhone 11 pro. Not disappointed. I am not one to run out and upgrade every time a new phone comes out and I think iPhones are priced way to high. But I decided the camera was worth the price of a refurbished 11Pro."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","REALLY GREAT PHONE! Absolutely nothing wrong, and I’ve had it for about a month now. The battery will last me all day and half of the next day, the camera is beyond incredible (all cat photos were taken with the phone), awesome gaming ability, huge storage capacity, nicely organized system, easy to understand, and a bunch of cute little features! HOWEVER, the screen is the thinnest glass I’ve ever seen, and I already cracked it. But if you aren’t a clumsy buffoon like me, it’ll be fine!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m enjoying the phone so far no problems I’ll update my review if something goes wrong"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","At first I was suspicious of buying a renewed product, but I must say that I am impressed, my iphone 11 pro arrived as new without details, battery at 98% so far without any problem, generic charger and cable but it is not a surprise because it is published like this, I noticed that the phone was renewed because it had a little adhesive on the top of the phone, happy with the purchase from this seller BuySPRY"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone arrived in perfect condition with 90% battery life. Very happy with this."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I completely love my new phone! Works great, just like brand new! I was a hesitant to buy a phone online (my first time buying Renewed) and it works great! It did not come with the original box or the original charging cord and plug, which I’m ok with. The item came in great condition and was packaged well. Phone had no scratches and accepted my SIM! Phone works so we’ll! I’m so happy with my phone! Will buy again when it’s time for me to upgrade!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ha tenido varías fallas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The screen became unresponsive over the course of only 3 months and stopped working completely as of today. Before this, it was ghost tapping since I got it, but was manageable after a quick turn on and turn off. Wouldn't ever buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","the phone had two large scratches on the screen that i can see from far out... and other mini scratches, i dont know who owned this phone before but they really didnt show it any kindness.

more scratches on the frame aswell, and battery was at 78%, I thought this was a better deal, shame.. i could have brought this locally for 50 dollars less and probably have non of the scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great purchase arrived 2 days earlier! The phone is unlocked in perfect condition with a 98% battery life. Sis is winning!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me Agrado que esta muy bien Cuidado a excepción del Glass tiene unas Rayas profundas del Resto Bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fast shipping for certain, the battery life was originally 91 I believe then after one update it went down 2 to 89. There was also some screen damage. A quart in. Gash in the screen I noticed when I took the screen protector. Wasn’t pleased with that cause if I’m paying high money for this the screen could have possibly been replaced beforehand. Otherwise not too noticeable if you don’t focus in on it. All in all the phone is decently good tho."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great….. it’s smaller than u thoight but hey."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is my first iPhone. I switched from a pixel 3 that I felt was overpriced for what I got it for. This phone came in perfect condition, battery life was at 100% life and really like this device. It’s fast, no hesitations or odd pauses to be seen in the few days I’ve had it. For a renewed device I think this is a grand slam. Won’t need to get a new phone for years now. Goodbye Android"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Looks brand new. No scratches and comes with screen protector"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El aparato me llego en perfecto estado no tengo queja alguna, excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was skeptical about the product but as soon as it got here and for about a month’s use, it’s very good for your money if you’re looking for an upgrade"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I'm a happy customer! I bought a phone from this seller, and the phone was the incorrect size. (My own error) but it was so easy to make the return and get a refund! Very pleased, all smiles!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love my new phone it arrived like new and in great condition. I bought it right before the iPhone 13 was released so was a little upset because I paid so much for a phone 2 generations behind but I’m happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I do not recommend this product in 2022. Other reviewers were lucky with the battery having 90%+ health, however, in 2022 I'd assume by now most batteries are hovering in the mid-lower 80%, which is right around the suggested replacement point by Apple and will cost you an extra $70.

While the promise/guarantee is 80%+, again, the replacement recommendation is at 80% by Apple so it is not saying much. If I could go back and do it again, I'd just buy new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","100% battery health. Exelent!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto en muy buen estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works well with Walmart Family Mobile"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was so scared to receive this item after reading all the reviews. But it’s literally in flawless condition AND came with a glass screen protector installed on it. The charger wasn’t an original but that doesn’t really matter. There are no scratches, dents, or anything and it looks absolutely brand new. Thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Batería 97% se puede usar en Honduras"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Screen has scratches all over and the battery life is at 87%. The seller should be honest about it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","😍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought two of these phones and one works great but the other has problems with the speakers. The in call volume is horrible, you can barely hear at all despite the volume being at max. Also when you try to watch a video the speakers sound blown. I'm hoping they can just replace the phone as the price has gone up since I purchased it last week"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tengo un mes con el teléfono y todo ah ido muy bien es rápido, llego muy bien como nuevo sin detalles y con un protector de pantalla incluido todo funciona como si fuera un iPhone nuevo. Lo único que cambia y en la descripción te lo dicen el cargador es diferente y no incluye los audífonos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought an 11 pro and the battery barely charges on my usb - c and dies very quickly. Bought an “excellent” condition, returning and hoping the next one works and is “certified” to a higher standard."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I paid for a renewed premium cell because battery was supposed to be at least 90%, but it is 83%. Too bad!! I live in another country, I can’t send it back because I’m not at USA anymore"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfecto!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m very pleased with this phone!! It works great!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","There were several, unacceptable problems with this Amazon renewed phone from the beginning, and now, 5 months later, those problems are even worse. I spent a lot of time making sure these problems were not issues with my settings or fixable. I even spoke to an Apple technician, and he agreed these were not things I could fix myself. The touchscreen is weak or nonexistent in particular areas of the screen. The phone only rings or gives me notifications for about half my calls and texts. The screen locks up way too often, and sometimes the speaker is staticky. I understand I bought a used phone, and I wouldn’t expect it to be perfect. However, the standards advertised by Amazon Renewed were not even close to being met in this phone, and Amazon would not help me. They directed me to Apple to have it fixed at my own expense."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone came a day earlier than expected with a protective screen already on top. It comes with a charger cable and base both of which are third party items. It did not come with the adapter cable with headphones, unfortunately. The screen is also arguably third party but it comes it great condition and you can’t really beat that."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My phone screen either doesn’t work half the time, or will randomly just spazz out. This didn’t start happening until AFTER the warranty expired, Ironically enough. I messaged seller about the problem and they didn’t respond. Do not buy from this Hybrid IT."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m only 3 days into using the iPhone 11pro. This is my first iPhone ever and I think I love it lol! As far as this exact device it’s flawless. It has a screen protector on it so I’m hoping that isn’t to cover up major scratches but the phone performs and looks perfect. Not a single scuff even on the bezel"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono está como nuevo y todo le funciona perfectamente. Lo único es la batería al 88%. Estoy muy satisfecha con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ordered this thinking it would have some light scratches and OK battery health... Turns out, the phone was brand new. Pristine condition. 100% battery health. And I have the option to purchase an Apple Care plan within the next two months. Wow! For the price, I don't think I could have made a better purchase. Your mileage may vary, but this really worked out for me."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Para comunicación y música y fotos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","BUYSPRY, ECOMMERCE,AMAZON RENEW ARE ALL SCAMS. I AM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE ITS PRICEY I BOUGHT 2 IPHONE 11Pros THE FIRST ONE COMPLETELY DIED MEANING DID NOT WORJ AT ALL DID NOT EVEN CHARGE.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone didn’t work. Took it to 2 different places to get it fixed and they couldn’t fix it. Was refunded my money very fast but it’s still a hassle. It was a present for my 86 yo mother"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very skeptical about buying a refurbished phone. But I saved about $300. It said in the description that it was guaranteed to come with 80% battery and mine came with 96% battery. I am very pleased with this purchase. It has also helped me to buy other refurbished products."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono no funciona la pantalla se cambia las aplicaciones, No me permite escribir bien y no hay como trabajar pésima inversión. Desde el principio estaba así fallando pensé que mejoraría pero ahora no vale en lo absoluto no puedo utilizarlo. Y nos tiene ni 3 meses ya que lo compré desde noviembre pero recién lo pude ir a ver en febrero."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","OK"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A couple days into having my iPhone 11 pro the touch screen had problems to begin with it wouldn't read what I would click on at times. Other times the screen would jump so I wanted to get refund but then it stopped so I said to myself maybe the problem just went away but THEN today 7 days into me having this phone the screen went black, I already tried a hard reset, did it a couple times in hopes but its just not working. So sad about this purchase.AND NOW IM READING THAT I WILL ONLY GET 50% OF MY MONEY BECAUSE I CANT TAKE OFF THE ICLOUD!??? IF I WASNT SOLD A PHONE THAT WENT BLACK BY THIS COMPANY NAMED CELLULAR SOURCE I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF MY ICLOUD!!!!! I SPENT $620 SO THAT MEANS I WILL ONLY GET 300 BACK WHICH IS A BIG RIPOFF"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Paid for the premium renewal. It looked fine on the outside but inside was sus. Speakers didn't function correctly as if it was submerged in water. There was a black / gray grease along the bottons and the charging port was gunked up. I wiped it all off and started the backup process. After it was done I left it alone after noticing it was hot for half an hour but it wouldn't cool down. I shut it off and waited, same thing. I though Amazon quality stamps meant something. I returned same day, none of that gypsy BS. Get your quality control in line if you're trying to stay in this refurb business. -5/5"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","quick shipping, seems to work fine, looks real good, set up was easy even for an old man thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone is in good working condition, there are many scratches on the sides and screen which is disappointing but expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Even though the listing gave the model number as A2160 (North America), I received model A2215 (UK/Europe). Both models are iPhone 11 Pro, but the A2215 will not work in North America due to the different cell bands. I don't know how to make sure you get an A2160 since the listing clearly states the product is an A2160. I'll be returning for a refund and looking elsewhere.
The phone itself arrived early and is in great shape and I wish I could keep it, but it's a pretty expensive paperweight right now!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I didn’t use it yet because I bye it as a gift for someone so I can tell Weather if you walk in good or not"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in perfect condition with a great/new USC to Lightning rapid charger. I hoped for a better batter battery life with the 11 pro, but love everything else especially that it felt like I got a brand new phone from this provider ❤️. Great value for your money!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works as should, and looks new."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was shipped to me without a SIM Card Tray... There is just an empty hole in the side of the phone. When I called Amazon they scheduled me an appointment at the closest Apple store. They told me that I have to wait another week for them to order a SIM Card Tray and then drive back and pay for it when it...

This is unbelievably inappropriate for a 3rd party company to sell a phone that is missing essential hardware for its function.

The Business Card for Warranty Information by the company Stone Group USA has an email listed that comes back as undeliverable when you email and a phone number that doesn't exist."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this phone as a gift for my brother who lives in a different country. It arrived as promised, like a new phone, no scratches, works like new, and unlocked. Very good value. Thank you very much."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It was well pack in excellent condition ready to use outstanding seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good phone for the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just received Iphone 11 pro 64 gb variant and the phone was in amazing condition, it had no scratch or any defect. However I'm really disappointed with the device warranty. Serial number showing warranty expired however there must have been 1 year warranty from apple with it. Tried contacting customer service of amazon and apple but still no luck."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was in great condition besides a single dead pixel on the screen. Other than that my wife loves the camera and is happy with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cosmetically the device looks brand new, no scratches, dings or dents anywhere. It also came with a screen protector installed. Operationally, the device performs like it’s just out of the box. I am very satisfied with the purchase and the seller. I purchased two already and now I am about to purchase another this week."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","very good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I expected slightly lower battery life (this one came at 86%) so happy with refurbished 11 pro w/ AT&T carrier. Some tiny scratches at the top of the phone and came with a tempered glass screen protector. Overall no complaints a few days in."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I loved how new it look and clean its the best decision I could ever make"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like the size fits in any pockets"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Really nice bang for a buck. Definitely smaller then I thought though."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This was smaller than I thought, I didn’t realize that there are two iPhone 11 sizes and this was the small one. Over priced for what it is. They said it would be delivered a week before it was actually delivered."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","They did a great job in having the phone delivered 2 days before it should’ve arrived... and the refund process was simple. Even though the phone only read my SIM card for 15 minutes"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was impressed with the reduced price but had some reservations about the phone marketed as renewed. I honestly thought it might come with some scratches or other minor damage. However it was in pristine condition and I am quite happy with the way it turned out. I love the midnight green color and, of course, the features of iOS 13 and the remarkable camera. I would buy this again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m very happy with the product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This product was amazing! It literally looks new and the battery life was 100%! I have no complaints and the shipping was so rapid. It does come with a charger and cube, but they are not apple. I don’t know why there is even any negative comments because the phone I got looks perfect. I definitely recommend buying this iPhone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The product works well and the seller is awesome. Please avail more products to my area."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It’s a good phone. I should have got a 11 pro max though as I like a bigger screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone died in 11th month of ownership! Even with ridiculous protection plan, I’m at a loss of $250. Not worth all the aggravation and stress!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cuando el equipo inicia, muestra una leyenda de que la pantalla no es original, pero luego de unas horas el táctil se vuelve loco, es imposible usarlo, es una lastima que indiquen que inspecciónan a cuidado los equipos y al final vienen defectuosos.

Vendedor respondió rápido y recomendó devolver el producto para reembolso."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone I received had a broken/damaged speaker that made it so I could only do phone calls via Bluetooth. This ended up creating issues at work. Was unable to return phone as I could not be without a phone for work or afford to purchase a new one before a refund was issued. Unfortunate situation, wish the seller would have done their due diligence before sending out my phone, now I’m out $400+."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am so pleased with my phone! Got the one I ordered. It was in excellent condition - like new. I’ve purchased phones through amazon before (don’t think it was this co.) but I never received a special tool to remove the SIM card with before. Nice touch. Came with a charging cord. Very satisfied with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like my IPhone 11 Pro"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is like new...glistening without a scratch on it. I bought the gold one, which is more like rose gold, and it's gorgeous."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I'm still learning this phone, but so far I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life 96% Face ID work perfectly 512gb now that’s a win for me it was worth it ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased this “supposedly” like new refurbished iPhone and the screen came with scratches along the edges. It was supposed to have no visible scratches from arms length which was not the case. I had to use it for work otherwise I would’ve returned but couldn’t afford another inconvenience after already having it arrive with the scratches.
Would’ve liked a refund to make up for the difference in the advertised condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came with 100% battery life

very little scratches but you cant even notice it b/c it's so small.

battery came 100%

The only thing i had a problem with was the wire it came with, It didn't work at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had to leave a review after reading all the other. I place my order before reading I was really scared from the reviews I did read. But I must say it came on time looks like new was able to activated threw metro with no problems. Love the new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","it's said that This product is eligible for a replacement or refund within 90-day of receipt if it does not work as expected. but it's not true I returned the phone because of the battery life but they didn't accept to replace it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es el iPhone pro
Y no es el max

Es lo único en que mienten

Pero de ahí en excelente estado 🥰"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto en muy buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone did have a charging issue no problem right purchased and sold by Amazon wrong still waiting on refund never had this problem before I don't know why I probably would purchase a cell phone locally next time I'm still waiting for a refund?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Been trying a week to start the ""renewed""phone. Downloaded update and installed updated operation system but still won't pass the initial setting steps. Just goes back to the initial ""hello"" screen.
Will try to get refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto en excelentes condiciones, sin rayones, batería 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Had a mixup in receiving another device I hadn’t ordered. Customer service sprang into action in making everything right. I received my correct model phone, with great battery life. You wouldn’t be able to tell this was a renewed device. The quality is out of the box. Thank you HQTronic!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works great! Sometimes Wi-Fi GO! In and out. Not sure if it’s my connection or the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great deal for phone that had a 99% battery life still no issues as of right now. No scratches on the back or the front and every feature works. I’ve had iPhones forever and this is again a great buy from a company I have used for the first time"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Yego en excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like alot"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It has a crack screened"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone had many scrapes and scratches around the edges and on the screen. Which was expected. Battery life was at about 80% which isn’t awful. Volume on phone is also terrible I can barely hear people when I answer my phone and have to put them on speakerphone to talk and speakerphone is very quiet as well. I spent $600 on this phone so I wouldn’t have to purchase another one soon but I’m definitely going to be getting another one to replace this one I need to be able to hear when I answer the phone. I always buy my phones refurbished this one seems to have the most damage out of all the phones I’ve bought in the past which was disappointing since it was the newest one I have bought."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nice deal, couldn't wait to receive it!!!!."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After seen mixed reviews about the product I decided to give a try, as mentioned by others it does not come with original charger and cable. This phone looks like new but after using for about 3 weeks it started having problems, it would freeze and show pink pigments and restart, it happened around 4 times, specifically while watching videos. The seller was nice and accepted a return for refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This company sold me a blacklisted phone, basically where i can’t used this device unless of wifi because it was stolen & the person got the phone unlocked and sold on amazon, I have contacted amazon customer service and also been back and forth out of MetroPcs and amazon haven’t helped me one bit , phone works good but won’t let me use my service for my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had read the the reviews to this and had expectations but i’ve been filled with nothing but trouble. came in clean and nice, great camera quality and nice and fresh, didn’t come with original charger but that’s ok. everything worked fine till it came to the issue of service. I bought my phone unlocked but when i had put my sim card it appeared as “searching” for an extensive amount of time then later appeared as “no service” just as the image ive kinked gotten from the web.i called my service provider, was on calls for hours, spent money for 2 new sims, and even $40 addition for checkup at best buy but yet no results and waste of money. good item i guess but i guess i wasn’t lucky as because without service the phone is useless"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","First the good- the phone looked brand new except for the packaging.Now the bad- it was not able to be activated. My carrier informed me that the phone was ether not actually unlocked or, had been reported stolen.I returned the phone without a problem amd a refund was issued."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The first one was great so I bought a second one and this is it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone came spotless and came with OEM apple 5Watt Brick and cable. Everything is smooth and no issue except it came with 100% then dropped 5% battery health since I received it on December 10th. At the time I write this it’s at 95% hopefully no more drastic drops from here."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Poor battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Grandson loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I really love the phone but there is a freaking scratch on this phone and I just paid 700 dollars for it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo funciona muy bien y está en excelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just got the phone a day early, pretty satisfied, had some huge scratches however w a nice screen protector they’re barely noticeable. All in all satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Screen stopped working the first day… I had a cheap case on it until I could get something nicer, and on the first day when I returned home from work it fell out of my pocket onto the hardwood floor… this kinda seems like my fault, but the screen didn’t shatter it just wouldn’t work (really colorful screen with no picture) so it’s almost as if there was a cheap off brand screen put on it. Maybe it really is just my fault because it fell, but I’ve never had an iPhone break from such a minuscule impact so something seems off. Anyways, now I’m down the price of the phone + the price of a new screen and I’m not exactly thrilled with that."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have this a 2 because in theory it would have been perfect. It shipped quickly with everything included and the setup should have been so easy.But this phone IS NOT unlocked for Sprint/T-Mobile. It’s very disappointing that it is marketed as unlocked and even lists Sprint/T-Mobile as carriers. But it is not actually unlocked and will not work. Luckily amazon has an easy return policy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iPhone came in nearly perfect condition. No scratches on the screen and the body is intact and beautiful. Very pleased, thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought this for my little brother and he has been using it for a few months and he hasn’t come across any problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me ha llegado impecable, sin rastros evidentes de injurias, ha llegado con una película antishock por lo cual no veo a detalle pero una mirada minuciosa impresiona libre de fallas cosméticas, aún no compare la calidad de la pantalla con otro teléfono igual, impresiona colores muy cálidos delatados por los colores blancos. Lo recibí recientemente por lo que la funcionalidad total no la puedo evaluar. Precio justo para la calidad recibida, lo recomendaría"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buena compra 9/10 viene ligeramente rayado de la pantalla pero lo demás muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone came with a1 inch hairline crack towards the top. Other than that... the phone works... battery life a little less than expected.... but then again it's a renewed phone... not New.... so they're are things that I compromised on. It will serve it's purpose.... Just keep your charger handy on those long workdays...."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Every day in used"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love the phone but unfortunately I wanted iPhone 11 Pro Max and I thought I selected that but they sent iPhone 11 Pro"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it a Lil blemish but you can’t tell...will order again"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came literally like brand new! It’s hard to even think that this was refurbished! I was a little skeptical and worried at first buying a refurbished phone on amazon after reading all the other reviews.

I paid extra for it the be in excellent condition and it didn’t have genuine apple parts. Battery life was 83%. Wouldn’t recommend, item not as advertised. Not worth the hassle. Ended up getting a refurbished I I phone for the Apple Store. All genuine parts, no problems and better battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","one scratch and battery is about 82%. product received as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Scratch hidden under screen protector. They should have mentioned that in the description"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased two renewed iPhone 11 Pros via this listing and both arrived without a visible scratch, all functioning perfectly, and with 94% of battery capacity remaining.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ve been wary and skeptical, because of the reviews and I ve never purchased a renewed smartphone. Since Amazon offers a friendly return policy, I decided to give a shot.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me agrada en todo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Price and celular"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The device arrived with some mark on the screen looking like water or some liquid. The speakers had something white blocking them I don't recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Finally enough space for my photos and all my apps. It gets a ZERO for fingerprint reader, there is none. I bought the renewed iPhone 11 Pro and it hasn’t a scratch or blemish anywhere. I would certainly recommend one"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Didn’t even care to replace the broken battery or screen it broke not even a day after getting delivered went to Apple to find out that you did a background check and you knew there were broken pieces to the phone. But still didn’t care to replace it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is very good however the delivery really let it down"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Downgraded our payout from $120 to $61 said the screen was cracked. It wasn’t when we sent it. They didn’t include a picture. Just paid half of what we expected.I wonder how many others had the same issue."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery capacity less than 75%. Bottom speakers not even working at all. The Sound is horrible on the handset."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I haven’t even had this phone a year and it will not turn on at all. I took it in to be repaired and they said it would cost $500, which im obviously not going to pay. So now I don’t have a phone and im out all the money I spent on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So I purchased this for my wife in hopes to replace her current phone 10. I was expecting a renewed phone but instead it seems like I may have gotten a renewed used phone because there are tons of scratches on the screen upon opening the phone from the box. The phone has been functional so far so I that’s great, but the screen is cuffed in multiple locations and that’s a bit upsetting. Will update soon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No visible scratches. Like the Face ID. Phone is an aller than my 7Plus, but same screen size. Looking forward to trying the camera, which is main reason I wanted to upgrade. Pleased with purchase, have been waiting to get it since it came out. Great price and will get $125 for my old iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The order came in a plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap like once and a brown box. The charger that came with it also didn’t work and also the battery goes so quickly. But everything works perfectly and they did give a screen protector on the phone already which is thoughtful"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No quiere leer mi targeta sim ayuda por favor o es que el teléfono viene bloqueado?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So far so good!! I would go for this iPhone I trust the reviews a little bit more. Still be cautious. I was still with an Android so I didn't have a SIM card, I just went to Metro and got me sim card from their."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Its worth to have the renewed iphone with good quality and packaging."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ordered the 11pro Amazon preferred and received the phone and bright to my carrier (Sprint). The phone can’t be hooked to their network, so it’s not Unlocked. Called Amazon, got the runaround. They finally decided to replace with a different phone. 2 days late for delivery, at least I got a replacement, at least I have it, right? Wrong….another trip to the carrier. Guess what? Won’t hook to the network. Again, Amazon advertised that it would work for sprint. So now I have 4.5 hours of my time at my carrier and multiple phone Calls, approximately 3 hours, and still no phone. This was an extra bad experience with Amazon with a side of wasted time. Save yourself the aggravation and look elsewhere. With all of this said, I’ve been a Prime member for 14 years or so and this experience has me seriously questioning my renewal with Amazon. Good luck."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono está como nuevo ligeros detalles"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had return the phone & was issued a full refund because I had purchased the incorrect model prefer MAX but the phone did NOT have any flaws no scratches, dents, or smears! Excellent condition, but I like what I like so returned!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","when i got my new phone the screen had a bunch of hairline cracks. coming from the edges inward at they were very small and gradually grew some go all the way across the screen. i wouldn’t buy from this seller again. just because i would have to go without me phone for as long s it took them to fix it and send it back and i can’t be without my phone"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My past phones battery life was awful. I was quite surprised with how long this iPhones battery lasts without charging. The phone is sleek and looks very nice. The functions of the phone itself work wonderfully. Overall a great phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Guess I’ll try again for an iPhone that was really refurbished. The last one from Amazon was perfect. This one had an old battery. Chose the 11pro specifically for improved battery life over the X, but I’m not going to accept a battery on its way out!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I loved everything. It was in really good condition. The problem was it did not take any SIM card. I was gonna spend more money fixing it with a 50/50 chance. So I returned it. But if it worked I would have said it was awesome!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I wanted a better camera and this phone has delivered! I also like the new features and longer battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Screen little bit scratched."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this renewed IPhone in March 2022. In September, it began to not hold a charge. Upon, further investigation the Apple battery was replaced with a generic product, prior to my purchasing. Since, it is not an Apple battery, I can get no assistance with this product. I took a chance and definitely got burned!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","IT almost looked like new if were not but a few scratches on the screen maybe due to lack of screen protector by the former owner.But good performance.. this is my first Iphone.. I also have an S10 plus"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love this phone!! At first I was worried about it being unlocked but no, it all came as I wanted. I was able to switch my SIM card to this iPhone with no problems.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo vino con salud de batería de 96%, con golpes evidentes en sus esquinas y parte frontal, no funcionan bien los parlantes, ni el auricular ni el altavoz. He comprado varios productos en Amazon pero jamás había recibido algún producto en tan mal estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Needed a new iPhone with more storage but because the new iPhone comes out next month, my phone carrier is only offering the 64gb with all models. Decided to grab this one and so far I’m absolutely amazed at the quality. Did come with an off label charger and plug but that’s totally ok, phone works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was worried about buying this for how cheap it was compared to other places, but it arrived almost brand new (with the exception of the charger which was fine..) Definitely worth buying instead of investing $1500.00 on a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Speaker on the phone sound like it is broken and has very bad qauality. Can't hear phone calls or music properly.Otherwise a good product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone cosmetically was horrible, it was all scratched up and hidden with tempered glass.. so I don’t think it was worth what I paid however it worked just fine, decided to just keep it because it’s troublesome returning and paying for shipping all over again so purchase at your own risk."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto pero pensé que vendrían los audifonos y cargador original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono tiene rayones en la pantalla visibles a más de 60 centímetros, tiene rayones grandes al costado, en la base, en todo el marco y en la bandeja del chip. Vino con el auricular sucio con polvo y con rayones en los lentes de la cámara de fotos y además la batería tiene una autonomía del 57%.Una compra completamente inútil. Una estafa."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 I just open the pack and start using. After a while it stop working and started working by it self. Dont recognise my touch.
Then I order another one which works perfectly."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The charger they provided (a third party cord/block) for this iPhone 11 Pro does not work, nor does any other third party charger. I tried multiple charger on multiple blocks in multiple outlets. The only charger I own that works is a very old frayed/taped authentic iPhone cord. I don’t know if this is just how apple operates with the newer model phones or if this phone is defective and needs to be returned. I Messaged the seller and I’m waiting to see what they say. Everything else is fine with the phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Awesome , it’s almost brand new, with 512 storage, its e very good phone, for $900 it’s worth it, better then you go in Apple store and pay $300-$400 more for the same quality. I will keep updating if something changes. Thank you seller 🤝"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life mainly, and as a second tool, I have two phones, the other one is a iPhone X, I get stunned by the camera and how the back looks, every time I use it, the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely it for 2020"

However, the item came locked to t mobile carrier even though I bought it “unlocked”. I had spectrum mobile and couldn’t connect with them so I ended up changing to metro pcs ( T-Mobile) and it works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Software not working and battery drain"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My daughter love this phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Straight forward, overall great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great iPhone! Like Brand New, except it doesn’t have the original box. Even has Battery health of 200%. It doesn’t matter because it also came with a new, compatible usb & plug. Love the camera!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Exactly what I was expecting. Great condition and good battery life!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ordered mine from the seller BuySPRY -

The first phone arrived with minor visible scratches along the rail - nothing I couldn't live with.
But once in, it said ""Non-genuine Apple Display"" (see pic). Secondly the battery was almost degraded at 80%. Returned it for a replacement.

The replacement arrived in even worse condition.
1. The main camera lens was scratched (see pic)
2. The screen had a tempered glass screen protector - to hide the fact that the screen underneath was indeed cracked (see pic)
3. The front speaker was crackling - so it was definitely blown.
4. The battery came at 83%

This is really poor from Amazon Renewed. These products aren't even checked before sending off.

Do yourself a favour and pay more for an Apple certified refurbished product instead."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Personal use"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love this phone. It completely feels like brand new, I never would know it was refurbished. I love the gray color, I love the size, I love the camera and the battery life is great too."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía muchos daños en la parte física, era un producto que evidencia mucho uso.

7/10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","If y’all looking to get a look like new phone. This isn’t the way to go. The one they gave me has scratches along the side and the top of the phone. It’s def not a look like new phone. The screen and the back look fine, but when looking along the edges and the camera there are hella scratches. If your not trying to save money just get a new phone, it’s much more worth it. This purchase I would say is not worth $750 for all of its imperfections especially when the description says “minor to no scratches”. These scratches are not minor and I am dissatisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone comes without any presentation I thought I would receive a refurbished phone but with the real conditions the charger does not work or is compatible with the phone since the cell phone itself indicates it. The charger is not original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone I received was in great condition, no cosmetic issues at all. Battery health was shown to be at 86%. Have had it for over 2 months without any issues whatsoever."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought a premium renwed and they mentioned the battery will be not less than 90% and i found it 85% iam so disappointed 😞"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great condition although I changed my mind and bought a 12 instead and returned, full refund was honored"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The only thing I didn’t like about the phone was that it was very small for its price which I really can’t say is amazons fault but everything else is in great condition so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received my iPhone 11 Pro in new condition and delivery was pretty quick. It was exactly as described. Everything works as should. I’m happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","never like it looks fake and small"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A little scared but once it came it’s 100percent real. No scratches, no damage, nothing it’s like if it was new. Doesn’t come in iPhone box. If anyone cared. I didn’t. 100% would ordered another!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It's like grand new, no scratch, no problem it's 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came very quickly and works well."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is a used iPhone
in the description it does not say that it is used and this phone is not new because it did not come in its original box"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Arrived really fast. came with third party charger and cable, understandable. Well packaged with screen protector. Almost brand new and everything works as it should. I would highly recommend so far.

Battery life is 100%, they obv put a new one in, which is nice. Great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","ya son varios los celulares que compro con esta empresa, han sido excelentes en todo sentido, la batería tiene buena capacidad de carga."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Batería al 98%, sin detalles técnicos ni estéticos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo que no me agrado es que el teléfono no sirve para nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","If you are looking for an iPhone I wouldn’t purchase with this company BUYSPRY. I received the phone via mail NOT properly boxed instead the phone was placed in a standard USPS shipping BAG. As you can image the phone was not properly working. I opened my camera app and the phone vibrated uncontrollably and make a loud electric noise. Of course I returned the phone ASAP and requested a refund. Fast forward BUYSRY had received the phone and never refunded me so I reached out after a few days. Only then was I made aware something needed to be done on my end. It took BUYSRY almost an entire week to refund me. SMH!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","charger is generic but works fine

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","scratches on screen and battery 86% and it has a weird noise and vibration when notifications drop its like if the screen isn’t the original but besides that everything works fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","As an iPhone user my expectations have been set pretty high and unfortunately they have not been met with this ""renewed"" premium iPhone 11 Pro as the phone has a tendency to freeze and process very slowly at times. Physicaly the phone was sent to me in 8/10 condition which is fine.

Unfortunately, I have no options except to return it. I'll give the renewed sector another chance but will definitely temper my expectations."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not satisfied with iPhone 11 Pro has problem battery I send back them they will pay me refund"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","looks good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Had to return this phone back to the seller because of a damaged LCD. You won't be able to return for an exchange. I placed another order again also purchased the screen protector from another seller. That phone came with original headphone and charger. So I returned everything back to the seller and completed the return.

While I got the 2nd phone, it didn't come with Apple charger. Found this phone is been used because it comes with protectors already. So I contacted the seller to ask for original charger and headphone. Here is what she emphasized in message to me --

Below is the description of the accessories included with your purchase.
""Box may be generic and accessories may not be original, but will be compatible and fully functional. No headphones included""
Please keep in mind that even when the accessories are not original they will function perfectly with the device and headsets are not included.

I should just keep that original charger based on their attitude. Think hardly before you want to save that $200 to get an iPhone 11 from this seller. They won't check the quality. You get what you paid for."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Si bien el teléfono no tiene golpes y lo estoy usando, el sonido no es bueno, se escucha como latoso. La batería no llega con la carga al 100, llega al 80 % y no sube mas, de hecho comienza a bajar estando enchufado. Envié mail desde la plataforma y nunca me contestaron. Una pena porque ya había comprado un usado hace unos años y no tuve un problema."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything about the phone was okay until I checked the battery it wasn’t 100% it was 83% which was disappointing I contacted the seller and am waiting for them to contact me back."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was skeptical when I first got this, but it felt right and indeed it had been everything I could hope for. Thankfully it was fully unlocked and the only thing that surprised me was needing a nano SIM card, otherwise five star rating."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","First time buying a renewed iPhone on Amazon. I was super worried that it wouldn’t work. But it looks just like a new one! I will keep buying electronics on Amazon!
It will be even better if they can provide original box and charger!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Batter health was only 82 % I was expecting a new battery at least"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came a little scuffed with permanent black marks on the back. I mean it works it’s a phone but I expected better."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","His phone was not refurbished correctly. It had a screen cover that probably cost a dollar late over the top to decorate the front and make it look like it was in good condition. However after realizing that The sound was hard to hear when on the phone we discovered the cover that wasn’t even placed on correctly so it covered the earpiece. Pulled it off and discovered all the scratches at the cover was hiding. When I was first delivered it came out of the package with the waterproofing hanging out the side. This phone is not refurbish correctly but more hidden to make someone make a purchase and not know what they were getting. Don’t buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone comes in a generic white box, generic plug and charger.
Phone looks like new, I believe screen has been replaced on both of the phones I bought as they constantly freeze and you have to wait for phone to die before touch screen works again. One phone will randomly start texting letters after a sent text BBbbBbb non stop. Its like its possessed and starts randomly jumping from open tabs. Phone is not worth the hassle, now have to shop again, wait again, and transfer again. All while hoping the phone doesn't freeze up on us. Unbelievable that this type of phone with these problems right after receiving are allowed to be sent out. Risking a review like this!!!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is the 2nd one I bought I love mine and he loves his it’s fine with me but there is 3 sizes for the screen just know it’s the small one but it’s still not small you got to think that this is all screen no Edges or home button space"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was nervous buying from an Amazon Renewed vendor, but BuySpry really came through! They sent a phone that looked practically new (with the exception of some very minor tarnishing on the aluminum surrounding the sides of the phone)! Very impressed and would absolutely recommend!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This item is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The battery that was put into the phone was rejected by the phone! You’d think that would be checked before selling.
Also my local Verizon ran a sale for the iPhone 11 right after and I got it for $150 less. So remember to check around first."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone works just like new. No scratches. Great price, highly recommended. I do find it odd that the phone doesn’t charge when it’s turned off."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this iPhone as a gift for a family member who lives overseas. So once I received it, I turned it on to make sure it was working and noticed they had added a screen protector to it. I didn’t think anything of it and put the phone away in a drawer. Fast forward 4 months later, I’m adding stuff to my luggage and go to set up the phone for her (I bought a case and screen protector) and as I remove the current screen protector from the phone I realized that the current screen protector was added to hide tiny cracks all over the screen. It’s hard to see from the photos but the cracks run through the entirety of the screen. It’s more infuriating because if the screen protector wasn’t there, I would’ve noticed the cracks when the phone arrived. This truly seems like an intentional deceit."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Damaged screen. Product not as described"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Meet the expectation"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is to small. Why make the 11 pro smaller than the actual 11. Just dumb! I hate this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The front facing camera arrived with a scratch on it.
I purchased a protective case and the screen shattered on the first drop - this is clearly an Apple issue as my old Samsung was dropped hundreds of times without so much as a scratch on it."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My phone came basically brand new... it already had a screen protector on it also. The best part is that it came two days earlier than it’s original delivery date. This is the best iPhone I’ve purchased so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone came with a relatively damaged box which was initially concerning. The packaging was very cheap. I was first happy to see that the phone came with a screen protector on it but later noticed it wasn’t from good intentions. I noticed what looked like a crack so I removed the screen protector to notice the phone was very heavily scratched. Safe to say this did not look like new at all so I returned it. Another surprise upon return came as well though. You have to pay for return shipping costs. Do not purchase your better off to buy an older model from Apple."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased December 2020 and phone died January 2022. Had the 1 year and 2 weeks and it’s a brick. Didn’t drop and attached photos to show no damage etc.SELLER WILL NOT ANSWER MY MESSAGES!! Very poor customer service and do not recommend. All of my past iphones have lasted me 5 years before I upgrade. I spent over 5 hours on the phone with apple and a couple hours in person with apple tech support and essentially I have a paperweight. I’m 100% grateful for Apples customer support and working with me to fix the phone even though there is no warranty with them. This is unreal. Beware of product being “refurbished” and actually a lemon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Satisfied with my phone it looks brand new and it even still had the apple warranty"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Been using it for a month now and haven’t had any issues. Great upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo llego en super buen estado 10/10 lo uso en Perú y es una maravilla"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came with both speakers blown and distorted. Beyond that, it was in impressive condition. Battery was at 84%. I ended up returning it and was a disaster. Took 2 weeks and a call to Amazon. If the return was better it would have boosted my rating."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was extremely happy with this purchase! The phone appeared to be brand new! No scratches or anything. Battery at 100% capacity. Came with a screen protector on. Also came in a generic box with generic charger as expected. 5 stars!!! Completely worth it 👍🏽"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","In great condition battery is better then my iPhone XS Max. :) it’s also came 2 day early so that was nice"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have really no complaints. It came out almost like new the box is different but the phone is very solid"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It was good no scratches and even came with a charger works good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I only bought Androids this is my first Iphone and I love it so much so thank you definitely worth it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Do not buy it, my phone broke and I went to the Apple store to get it fix but then they couldn’t fix because it had no apple material in the phone and everything was tape down in the inside of the phone I know it sounds crazy but it true plus I bought this phone for like 850 and I only had it for 8 months so that money went down the drain, i recommend going to a apple store to buy a iPhone or going to your local service store do it the right way and don’t buy even phone on amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone11 Pro that I received works exactly as stated and I am totally satisfied with my purchase. Saved a few bucks buying used and the phone was as good as new. The battery life/capacity is still at 100% as well. Great buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in PERFECT CONDITION! Nothing wrong with it! The seller has great communication and in a timely matter, thank you so much !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone meets my expectations but when I ran a diagnostic on the battery its capacity is only 85%. That’s within the advertised specifications but the bare minimum."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Shipping was great, got it in good conditions. Was hella happy with already screen protector on it. Only thing I'm mad at myself is that I missed and forgot my lock code so now I'm going through hell to unlocking it again. But overall Best Buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Una pésima compra no se lo recomiendo a nadie comprar este producto, me llegó con el faceid dañado y la cámara frontal de dudosa procedencia con un rayón en el botón de bloqueo, el auricular frontal defectuoso y sucio además del tiempo perdido en hablar con los vendedores ni amazon me ayudó les ayudó a los vendedores a estafar porque les di pruebas y no hicieron nada, soy de Ecuador al parecer si eres de otro país aprovechan y te envían equipos defectuosos por que saben que se nos dificulta la opción de devolución del producto, se excusan diciendo que son errores y que se lamentan de lo ocurrido pero ellos tienen bastante tiempo para verificar y estar seguros de lo que envíen y no estar mintiendo a las personas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was so afraid to purchase item due to comments I’ve read but this phone is amazing. I love it and I am giving this a 5 star."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Overall the phone is a good working phone but sometimes it won’t get me notifications when I get messages off Instagram or some other apps even though I have all my notification settings on."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this phone as a replacement, and it works great. Everything was exactly as described."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hours after activating this device it was blocked by my carrier because it had been reported stolen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","horrible phone do not buy from this seller, they clearly do not check or inspect the phones they are selling.paid hundreds of dollars for my iphone 11 pro but the speakers did not work. the speaker holes looked like they had glue or silicon stuck in there couldn't hear an type of audio. besides that everything else on the phone worked fine but who would ever want to pay hundreds for a phone that does not work properly. the process of returning the phone and getting my money back took about 10 days."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just a heads up"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got this phone in May. It had a weird screen protector that was cracked and difficult to remove and now randomly just shuts off. Having hardware issues now. Contacted seller will let you all know how it goes. So far not impressed!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very hesitant to buy a phone online especially off amazon but I was not disappointed. The phone came earlier than expected and is in perfect condition and even had a screen protector on it. If you’re hesitant just do it cause yolo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is in excellent condition, you would not know it was refurbished. No issues at all"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I'm glad I bought my iPhone 11 Pro. Great price. I wish it to continue as wonderful as it does now. I bought it a month and a half ago."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Vale la pena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone arrived in like-new condition and works perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","That’s good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had to reset and unlock it with iTunes which I found silly considering it says fully unlocked in title. Working fine besides that and in good condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came in great packaging, better than I expected. Also came early!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone está como nuevo, fue una excelente compra, y el detector de rostro funciona muy bien."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","LIKE BRAND NEW. I LIKE IT 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 I thought it would have something wrong with it but I was actually wrong....it’s in like new condition. Only downside was the original cords was replaced but it’s replaced with a certified fast charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro"," I thought it would have something wrong with it but I was actually wrong....it’s in like new condition. Only downside was the original cords was replaced but it’s replaced with a certified fast charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received in the mail after a week of order date. Thought it was a refurbished or newish phone, but it only has 87% battery life for $800. Not to mention the storage space has been compromised from previous owner after adding and deleting. Trade in value for this phone is $450, so they profited $350 and did not put a new battery in it!

Now I wish I would have spent a bit more for a brand new iPhone 11 instead"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No dan detalle del tamaño del producto. Al recibirlo está bien, pero es muy pequeño."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this renewed iphone, and things were ok at first. Had a few glitches with apps randomly closing, etc. Nothing crazy. Then the phone started shutting off when I opened certain apps. Again, not a huge deal. I thought maybe I didn't have it configured correctly, as a first time iphone owner. But it kept getting worse. Now 3 months in, for 2 days it shut off EVERY time I opened an app. Now it won't turn on at all. I spoke w/ Apple, they walked me through some steps to fix it, but they aren't working. It is so corrupted that it won't update, and can't even do a factory reset/restore. It's just stuck on the black screen. Not happy with this purchase at all- a phone with this price tag should last more than 3 months."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I spend the money because I wanted their best camera. I you don't need the best then save some money and buy a plain Eleven. Nothing wrong with that camera either"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I need to return it since it stopped working, tried to reach out for free shipping to return but was not able to get it. Disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just like new! No scratches or any imperfections! Great buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone looked and felt fine but then I made a few calls and thats when I found out the sound was horrible, static and muffled. Wasted my time"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy pequeño"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this product twice, and at first the camera was defected but second product had defected audio, I had to put my phone my phone on speaker every time. Do not waste your time and money please. This is crap."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It came in perfect conditions, 100% battery life percent, not asingle scratch, totally unlocked. It is like new. Im very happy because before the purchase, I read the other people comments and I was pretty worried but my phone is totally perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Worked decently for a couple of months and now the touch screen freezes all the time, the battery dies within a few hours, the text constantly switch’s to numerical and back again. Overall just a glitchy phone. Not worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love it it’s exactly what the description said. Very clean it looks new to me. I’m impressed. I was so impressed I bough my fiancé one and he loves it I got the gold and he got the black."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone looks and works like new! No scratches, hardware, or software issues after 3 days"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love the phone......I didn't like that it came in an android phone box"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","arrived like a new product, you can not differentiate this one from a new iphone, except the box is not original iphone box."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto , 97 % de batería , luce como nuevo realmente , 0 rayones , libre para Colombia 🇨🇴"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Para el trabajo es perfecta"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Could not hear through the speakers."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came in as described with an already applied screen protector. No issue activating on T-mobile"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life was greater than 90%. Really nice.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything is great with the phone, until I saw that it came with 86% battery life.. why call it “renewed” when the most important thing, THE BATTERY, is old."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Wouldn't recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love the camera on this phone. Also the 256 gig hard drive space is wonderful as well. I feel I am gonna have this phone for a long time."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came essentially brand new. 99% battery life, everything works and functions as if it was a brand new phone. Very pleased, but this phone does not come with original box or accessories."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Best shipping and receipt timing ever. The product was easy to activate and turned out to be a great gift. Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone vino con el altavoz dañado, hice una inversión alta para comprar el teléfono de buena calidad y me llegó dañad, soy de ecuador y volver a enviarle a US me salía más caro que comprarme uno nuevo, pésimo servicio y producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone wouldn’t even get past the start up screen. Factory reset over a dozen times and still nothing. Super disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The product exceeded expectations. Loaded from my old phone easily once SIM card installed and was up and running perfectly in less than an hour."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Solid phone with an excellent camera and feel."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Product was in perfect condition, I returned due to the I order the wrong model, but I will recommend this product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","An iPhone is an iPhone and doesn’t need a lot of reviewing. Buying a renewed one is a cost effective way to own an iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Would recommend buying ""renewed"". Says it's in grade A contrition but mine came with large scratches on front screen. Nothing wrong otherwise just false advertising and misleading seller. Would advise paying extra $150 for product straight from Apple."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","en funcionamiento todo bien pero la cámara vino dañada y es un presupuesto alto para repararla"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Very good product just like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was nervous to buy from this seller as I had seen some bad reviews, but my iPhone 11 came good as brand new! No scratches or anything, working perfectly! Thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very disappointed with my purchase! I knew i would get a refurbished phone so i wasn’t expecting a pristine phone, but i also didn’t expect such low quality for the $600 i spent on it! The metal surrounding the phone edges was chipped and full of scratches. I could live with that because i planned on using a case. But the big disappointment was in the huge scratches on the screen itself! It was very noticeable in every angle and lighting. I needed a phone immediately so returning it would leave me without a phone since i sold my old phone to buy this one. I ended up taking it to a phone repair shop to replace the screen since that only takes 30 minutes. I really thought i would get a better quality phone for my money."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is unlocked and in perfect conditions, it includes the new fast charging charger from apple. Not even a single scratch"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","the volume button is sunk !!!! 😔😔😔😔😔 I can only control the volume on the screen !!!!! and some scratches on the screen ....."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I'm glad I didn't spend the money on a new one. I was skeptical of the reviews but I decided to ""bite the bullet"" and just went for it. Happy to say that it worked out."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone itself was in excellent condition. The problem was this was the model for the world version, not the US version. Therefore, It would not work on my carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Visible dents and dust can be seen easily. I can’t believe they chose not to clean it well before shipping."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Had some battery issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Looks great and performance is fine. It has a little scratch at the top but nothing to worry about."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fully recommended, nice product and very good battery, good cosmetic grade. Definitely I will buy my next iPhone with this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Was a little skeptical by the reviews but my phone arrived in amazing condition. Just has a little crack on the back corner of the phone but for the discount I can’t be mad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great buy come with a 100 % battery health very clean I’m so happy than I buy this iPhone. Came in good package"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have had this iPhone for around 6 months and dropped it in a small amount of water (6 inches). The iPhone's screen immediately shorted out and after about 5 minutes shut off. I tried many things to dry out the phone (placing it in rice overnight) but nothing worked.
I contacted Amazon about the issue of their product not fulfilling the product description of being IP68 water proof and received an email back from a 3rd party (BuySPRY) telling me that my actions voided the warrantee.

I am wondering how me dropping my phone in less than 3 feet of water for less than 30 minutes is voiding a warrantee that claims to do just that buy claiming a IP68 water proofing rating.

This iPhone is not waterproof and they will not receive returns once you (the customer) figure this out."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought an iPhone 11 Pro, then a few later months it died. I paid $700 for the phone. I took it to a phone repair tech and the mother board went defunct, cannot be repaired. I contacted BuySPRY and they informed me that the 90 day warrant period had expired. Obviously I neglected to pay close attention to that, however who thinks their new phone will die in a few months. They had no concern about my loss, offered nothing nor any compromise of a solution. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! They sold me a bad phone. Now I’m out $700, and have to buy a new phone. I feel robbed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo lo demás bien solo la bocina de enfrente tenía mal audio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The size speakers loud.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery health was at 95%. No scratches or dents. Definitely recommend, but results may vary."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought two phones from this company. Both worked good for about 5 months. One day I do the newest iPhone Update and my phone is crashing every 3 minutes. I brought it to the Apple store who told me that the motherboard had a problem and the iPhone would need to be replaced. Repairing it wasn’t an option. I contacted the company and they told me they couldn’t help me at all with the product. I bought it from them with a bad motherboard and find out once it’s too late for the return by date. The warranty is also no good because it expired before the company was even built. The least they could do is charge me to fix it. But no they provided no help what so ever. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It will simply be broken after the return by date just like mine."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was exactly as described! Will definitely shop here for my next device"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller :) 100% satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The camera quality on the front camera is worse than any android phone I’ve ever had I don’t know if it’s just broken or if all iPhone 11 pros are like this"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came like new! No imperfections or scratches!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fast delivery and iPhone is in very good shape.👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came with more scratches than I expected. The speaker is fuzzy, I can’t hear the caller clearly & it sound mumbling. I requested an exchange. They keep pushing the delivery date “ Your new estimated delivery date is: 04/27/2022” and after 2 weeks they ended up canceling the exchange. I tried again for exchange for 2 nd time and I am going through the same thing again. I will never buy from this company again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought it for my lil bro and he like it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iphone no es nuevo, tiene muchas marcas de uso, funcional. estéticamente no me gusto especialmente la pantalla y los filos del dispositivo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nada del otro mundo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","mine came with a defective screen and Amazon didn't recognize the problem. never again buying crap from Amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone has issues. Best to buy new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it would recommend but have a unlocked SIM card or talk with your carrier to see if it is locked phone won’t work if both the phone and sim is unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not problem yet"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life was not what I was expecting. Almost touching its bottom limit with a poor 80%.
All other aspects were working good."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono internamente previera estar bien, aunque sabemos que son reconstruidos, el teléfono por los lados está rayado, vino con vidrio templado, al quitárselo me percaté que la pantalla tiene unas rayas. Pudieron haberlo envido en mejores condiciones. Solo me dieron $20 por los defectos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó con un ligero detalle en la pantalla pero ni siquiera se ve
Estoy súper contenta"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased this phone from BuySpry in October and found out in December that the microphone was defective and that the phone would only work for calls if I used my headphones. In December, I let their customer service team know and they said they would be able to help as long as I had Apple diagnose it. I told them that lockdown had shutdown the shops and they said it would be fine. After a couple weeks, I was able to get to an Apple store that opened and had them put together a repair quote. I sent it to BuySpry and they blew me off and said they would not honor it. This company sucks - you're better off buying directly from Apple. They have plenty of refurbished iPhones so you don't have to deal with these shady people."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The cellphone looks great but the battery life is horrible. I got it with 88% and a month later is at 80%. I contacted the seller and they never responded"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it, the only weird thing is it came with a screen protector already on the phone that’s a little bit off center."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente compra.. el teléfono llego nítido... y en perfectas condiciones 94% batería. Full recomendados"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great product like brand new!! Love it! You will not be disappointed with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","battery's condition says 84% but it does not last half a day, the touchscreen doesn't work properly ir seems they have changed it. The maximum of volume is not that much and people say they don't hear me at phone calls.
I woud have returned it if I had how, unfortunately I live in Argentina and this was something they brought to me on a trip."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought renewed phones for the entire family and so far so good. this phone came new, no scratches, no signs of use, battery had 100% . face is working perfectly fine."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got the phone, noticed right away it was preused, the top camera lens had a crack and the apple logo had a noticeable scratch on it. Screen seems hard to tap sometimes, borderline unresponsive. Also see the top half of the screen flickering for a few seconds for no reason. Coming from android, not too inpressed with the “apple quality” everyone I know has been boasting of. Bummer!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came super quick. Looks brand new and performs as expected. Very pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m so disappointed with this purchase. I was hoping this would work, but unfortunately it didn’t work as expected. Also, returning and getting a refund is so much bigger a process than just sending back and getting a refund. I shipped this as requested through UPS a week ago and I am still awaiting a refund. Awaiting a refund of almost $500 is not fun for the budget."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Venía con una cuenta de otra persona y fue un desmadre para poder activarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought the cell phone as a Christmas present for my sister. I'm very disappointed. The cell phone started to give a lot of problems between them, the device started to heat up, burning my sister's hand and turning it off by itself, thus disappearing the information. Look for support with the seller and he told me he couldn't do anything. I was supposed to contact amazon. I do not advise anyone to buy these devices and neither does the seller. I will never buy anything like this again. For me it was a lesson."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","At first I was nervous about this purchase but after receiving and activating my phone M worries were put to rest . I love this one thank you so much"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ha funcionado muy bien el celular. Me ha gustado mucho y por menos precio. Además de que llegó en muy buen estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love it no problems works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I tried for hours to get the phone to update the software during the initial set up and transfer of data. It was unable to update the software after trying for over 4 hours. I took it to a professional who could not get it to work either. I was unable to transfer my data to the phone, or even make it to the home screen. Not as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Wasn’t completely unlocked. Only compatible with AT&T."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It never works for my password and stuff that I have on my phone I have to key everything in to get into my apps. This phone has been nothing but a headache. Some days I can’t even get a good call. It’s always dropping calls or they breaking up so bad that they can’t hear me I have to hang up. For this phone to be 550 plus I should not have the problems that I have with this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Vida útil de batería 80"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I don’t understand why you not sent to me headphones?Phone work but I need headphones!!!And charger is not apple charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iPhone 11 exceed my expectations the phone looked brand new with no blemishes and all the functions work perfectlyI will definitely recommend this vendor quick delivery and great product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pienso que por el costo debió ser un teléfono en excelentes condiciones me siento defraudado con esta compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","If I could give this iphone a zero rating that is what it would receive. The original seller was buyspry. The phone arrived in a non apple box, screen covering seemed moist, side of the phone was dirty, and scratches everywhere at $535. I didn't cut the phone on to see how it worked because the outer appearance was enough for me. The charger is so bootleg it was a absolute terrible purchase. I would not recommend. Immediately requested refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was clean honestly it works like it’s brand new! Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone freezes from time to time."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very excited to get this phone for my wife for Christmas, but it's been a total waste of money. It's had major issues restarting constantly after three months, but it seemed to fix itself and was alright for the next few months. However, just a few days ago it started having the same issues again. We took it to an Apple store today to hopefully just get it taken care of, but they claim it's a hardware issue and due to it being refurbished, they won't touch the device. So now I've got a nice $850 paperweight. Will not be purchasing from this company again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Went from an I7 to this. Like going from a 1963 VW to a 2020 Caddy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great product! Like new! Just perfect, so pleased with my purchase. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iphone 11 pro was great for a couple of weeks then something happened and it won’t run internet through my cell service only WiFi.It was working fine then it quitNow I have to take it to Apple and pay more money to fix it after I paid almost 900 dollars for itUpdate: the phone was fine it was in the carrier's end they reset it and it works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","this was a very good value and even came with a screen proctor pre-installed"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is the first item I’ve gotten from Amazon and I wasn’t satisfied. The screen is loose at the top and when I press something it just goes crazy. It starts opening and closing apps while flashing really fast. I DON’T LIKE IT AT ALL!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","There was a mark on the screen!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received my phone at the end of July, and so far, it’s operating no different than a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came unlocked just like I asked, no scratches, easy set up and came with a charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","First off mine came with a couple of scratches on the screen but they aren’t really noticeable while on. It also came with a screen protector already on."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nice and comfortable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It is a good phone but the audio is pretty bad. very low. bad quality and even when you put to record those 3-4 second doesn't even record the audio. in general looks like a fake phone not a real apple phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect with 93% batteryJust Phone and a generic charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Purchased this product only to find out when trying to change providers that the phone had a balance left on it from another purchaser. Consequently until the balance was paid the other person was considered the owner. Obviously I paid the balance in full but can do nothing with the phone. Plus Amazon is not assuming responsibility or at this out point even assuming any responsibility. I in the other hand am out over $1000.00. Which no assistance in store. Pretty risky to purchase a phone thru Amazon. Be very careful you may end up like me!!!! Just to let you know this was an IPhone 11 pro. The company Amazon subbed is not willing to refund it or exchange it. I will never buy anything again without knowing where it comes from."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","DO NOT BUY!! I regret buying this phone for this price. This phone shuts off or restarts itself about 2-4 times a day. The charger it came with sucks really bad!!!! I would return it but I had already paid to activate it. The phone itself does look nice and camera works great but this is the last time I buy a phone online."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was listed as EXCELLENT CONDITION. There are pixels out on the screen itself. Not happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It’s great, I bought it for my husband. The battery life is amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Looks like new but too small for me .But an overall good experienceThank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect device, everything working, just a criticism, it could have come in the box."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Doesn’t hold charge"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got the iphone, everything seemed ok, but the charging port was broken. I could only charge it via wireless charger.... Since it arrived fully charged, it is hard for me to think that the provider wasn't aware of this malfunction.They sent it to me like this intentionally. And still haven't got my money back.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Teléfono en pésimas condiciones deficiente de batería y detalles por todos lados"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came as advertised without any scratches or damages."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love itGreat buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Unable to activate if your phone carrier won’t take a refurbished phone!! Unable to get a refund as they’ll only refund the card purchased with. Sadly the card used was a legitimate gov’t issued SSI card. (My disabled sister needed a new phone and this was her phone of choice) and now she’s out almost $1000.00 and they cannot refund the card for legal reasons BUT are unwilling to grant her a refund any other way!! And still has no phone as it was sent back when we asked for the refund. Why can’t they just send her a new phone vs a refurbished one? Especially since they refuse to refund by just sending her a check. All we really want is the phone! Do your research prior to purchase!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything works great especially the facial recognition, i just don’t like because its was smaller than expected,"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Wonderful product.you would think it’s an iPhone 11 Pro Max.the difference isn’t much.just a little bit shorter than the 11 pro max."

This site small sellers on Amazon don't sell genuine iPhones. They are made from scrap parts of other phones. Shame shame.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this iPhone for my brother to use in overseas. But I found out that it’s not working there with their sim so I just wasted $800 dollars for nothing.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Read in the description that this product was like brand new , it came faster than i was told but it doesnt work . This phone shuts off every 5min
NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great shipping time just wasnt what i expected."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life was 90, I went to replace it, and the highest it went was 97 not even 100. The back camera's when I take a picture has a weird blur to them and glare especially with the flash on. The screen turned blue twice."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto y funciona muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone didn’t even last one month before it was broken. I took it in to have it looked at to be repaired and they found rust all over the motherboard the previous owner must have dropped it in water. Now it’s just a big waste."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Don’t waste your money buying from third party seller, I receive a phone late also got a iPhone which my SIM doesn’t work, and other things work perfectly. I also check on Apple store if they can check it or exchange, but the iPhone is always been sold to apple store. I don’t know how many people used it, but the important is they don’t inspect the iPhone 100%. I recommend people to to buy from either apple store or your local store. Hope THAT will help some of you.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","100% Recomendados"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ver good product not a single scratch and 100% battery life"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Man if you got a bad review your lying I so far so good man what! It’s brand new! Don’t sleep!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Literally the only apple thing is the iphone, not even the box and accessories are Apple. Not even worth the quality and the battery life for what I pay for. This is a total scam, and for send the phone back I need to pay $150 more, my worst experience buying on Amazon even though I always bought refurbished phones on Amazon like a iPhone X and a 7 plus, they were in perfect state, not like this crap of iphone 11 pro. Amazon just lost a customer. incredible."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was really excited to receive it but it quickly turned to hell. You can't hear the phone ringing, notifications NOTHING. The volume is set up as far as it will go. If you are refurbishing these phones checking out whether or not the sound works should definitely be apart of that scenario. I'm returning for a full refund! I definitely should have listened to the reviews."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","item in excellent condition. like new"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect condition and just as stated. Fast shipping. Very happy with purchase."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great camera system, fantastic smart phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Do not buy apple products from this seller or any other seller other that apple stores.My phone shuts down completly after a minute or few seconds. Normally if bought at the store, i would have a 12 month warrianty. But With this purchase I do not. Tried to contact the seller but they say the warrianty ia for only 3 months.Do not buy your phone here or you may loose your money as I did :("
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Got one with a screen protector installed. Pulled it off and saw one of the most scratched phones I've ever layed eyes on. Forget arms length, those canyons could be seen from across the room. The glue in the protector just helps hide them a little.If that protector lasted 90 days, I'd be paying $300 to get a replacement.Adding insult to injury, now I've got to pay a bunch of money to return the phone to the scammers where I'm confident it'll just be pawned off on another unsuspecting victim.As Amazon certified them, I hold Amazon responsible as well.What a waste of time and money. Never again."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I switched from an android"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Everything was good"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The speaker is not working properly, it is very difficult to make a call. Also the screen came very scratched.The rest is working properly though, but this iPhone is not renewed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen calidad de producto remanufacturado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Vida útil de la batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I try to exercise discernment when buying products of any kind.For example, car defects out of the factory, as opposed to a potentially sneaking car salesman neglecting to tell me about the transmission slipping. You won't know until you drive it.This phone looks great, functions well but the battery has a false bottom, and probably from water damage. It dies between the 10-20% threshold. Buyer beware."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was such a disappointment.It didn’t come with the box, it came with some generic charging cable and a cheap one at that.It came with some random screen protector on it so not even how a renewed phone should look like!I bought an apple computer renewed and it came as factory but this phone I give these people a 1 out of 10…I was cheated out of the box, charging cable and everything else that is supposed to come with it.The pictures were misleading also…WOULD NOT BUY FEOM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It takes the best pictures"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó muy bien y antes"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","As described. Mint."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This iPhone is very good to use and secure.I’ll never regret to buy it because I used to search network and a lot of things."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great service, recommended to all."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This company likes to charge $1000 for a phone that they refurbished but somehow don't care to replace the screen on phones that have big scratches on them.If I refurbish a phone, if the phone has deep scratches I will replace the screen. Especially if I plan on charging $1000 for what amounts to a USED device. Because I'm sorry guys but refurbished doesn't mean you polished it up with some glass cleaner or maybe replaced a simcard tray. It means that you make the phone look brand new.And I guarantee you as a phone reseller all the phones I call 'refurbished' look brand new. Stay away from these sellers. They cut corners and charge outrageous prices."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I Receive the phone without Bluetooth so I’m not happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works as expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","great phn"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone is no longer operational. The phone out of nowhere started to open up from the side and gave a very strong chemical odor. The phone now will not charge 100%. I never dropped the phone nor mishandled as you can see from the photos. The Seller is unwilling to take the return nor fix the problem stating I had a 90 window only to return the item. My suggestion is to stay away from the seller they're horrible to do business with."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love my new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone looked brand new, and the battery lasts me a day and half with normal use."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So far its worked perfect. I love it."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone looked brand new... no issues switching over."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The battery life was supposed to be improved from my old I-phone, but it’s worse! Charge only lasts me until late afternoon. And I don’t use my phone a lot. What a disappointment."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Product super good. But the delivery was the main problem."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estéticamente está muy bien es rápido y todo lo único malo es que se friza la pantalla y una ves se quedó la pantalla en negro durante un minuto tal vez en lo estético excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Exelente"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the IPhone 11 Pro and it was advertised as NEW. When it arrived it had scratches on the screen and not in Apple packaging nor did it come with Apple charger. I paid more money for it supposedly being new and it was not. Very disappointed. I wouldn't complain if I knew it was a used one but the fact that I paid more money for something that its not doesn't make me very happy. If I was buying a used one I would expect the flaws, but that's not what it was advertised as."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","when the phone was first delivered the screen was very low quality and it kept glitching. I contacted the seller and was told a replacement phone would be sent, it has now been 3 weeks and i still haven’t gotten the replacement so i’m stuck with a phone that doesn’t work properly"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No issues with iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","All good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","We purchased this phone in May and in September it stopped working. Brought into the apple store for help, and they diagnosed it for us, finding that something in the internal workings wasn't getting enough power. To fix the phone would cost more than purchasing the same phone new now, $550. Basically, with no return policy we have had the phone for 4 months and have wasted $615. An very expensive piece of trash."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just what I wanted"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","At first i was browsing to buy iphone 11 pro max and this product came to my attention. I checked all the nessary features and it was fine. Then when i put it on the cart, automatically the item was changed from i phone 11 pro max to just 11 pro. Didn't notice that change and i end up buying wrong item for same price.Then after i received the phone, the battery was only 95%.I will never recommend this seller to anyone!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I hate to comment negative but I have to! It's obvious that Lcd, battery, charger, and box changed and do not use apple part, so it's not iphone anymore and its just copy of the iphone! Amazon please do not let them sell a iphone copy under your name!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I thought I was purchasing iPhone 11 Pro MAX, but did not receive MAX version. I read negative reviews to this effect, but the positive ones outweighed, so I took a chance.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Avoid this seller at all cost. We bought an iphone 11 pro and it broke down and wouldn't start up after 5 months. The seller refused to take it back, replace it (even with an older version) or fix it. We took it to Apple and they said there were too many things wrong with it to even bother.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","What a bargain"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m so happy with my new phone thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I’m not reviewing the phone. The iPhone 11 is great. But SpryBuy has now sent me two “renewed” phones at $999 and $949—both with cracked displays. In the $999 phone, the display has a crack across the top right corner (and numerous scratches on the display). In the $949 phone, the display was cracked all the way across from side to side, about halfway down the display. They did cover it with a screen protector to conceal the damage. But it was visible from a distance in both cases. So these phones were not “renewed” in any sense."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","My wife hates apple and I thought this new model would convince her. I also bought her an new model iPad. She hates them both from a uses point of view. Not an easy phone in general. Sits on the counter unused."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Horrible company sold iPhone defected and don’t want replace it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought two iPhone 11 Pro, one of them comes with a defective ear speaker which indicates that it does not test the equipment well before selling. The other had a lot of scratches on the screen under a free courtesy projector that the kit supposedly carries.Too much money for a product in these conditions and without quality."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Whats to say it’s an apple."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The camera quality is poor. I’m convinced this is one of those china knockoff phones. Save your money"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me encanto el teléfono, muy buen producto..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excellent Condition. Like New. Works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Upon opening the package my “new” phone was covered in black gunk. The screen was dirty and scratched. Also, it doesn’t come with an apple brand phone charger. So I opted to return the item because I wasn’t satisfied with how poorly the state of it was and I also had to pay for return shipping."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Bought the phone and straight out of the box it was scuffed around the edges and around the lenses as well as having a crack in the screen. I don’t know what world calls that “refurbished”. I returned it as soon as I got it, which I had to pay shipping for, and about a week later I have yet to get my refund. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I've had this phone for just over 2 months and the battery is already pretty weak. The facial recognition doesn't work. The interface is skewed and the touch screen is minimally receptive. The camera is nothing to brag about. Don't waste your time or money."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This company does not take the time to perform quality control on their products. My phone came covered in dust and dead human skins. Also, after using the phone for a day the battery became very hot in which let to completely dying. Had to let the phone cool down to turn on once again to reset the phone for a return.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received the product and it was in mint condition from outside, no scratches or dents. But after the first charge I realized, it's max capacity was 80% & it will absolutely not go beyond that. Upon further observation realized it charges slower than other 11 pros. The cable I was given was generic and even after using an original from my previous phone the issue still persisted. Very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iphone 11 pro did not have a clear signal. It froze during use and calls broke up and they could not hear me 1/2 of the time due to the poor reception. It was the phone not my service. I went back to my Iphone 10 and it works perfectly and my calls are clear. It has been over 2 weeks since they have received the returned Iphone 11 pro and they have not reimbursed on my credit card. Would not recommend this company."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was purchased refurbished and I’m realizing now why that is. It gets stuck a lot and freezes, and is sometimes unresponsive. Buy a new one with warranty."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I bought this phone and tried to put it onto the Spectrum Mobile network, and Spectrum came back saying that both the primary and digital SIM IMEI numbers (phone's cellular ""serial number"") were not compatible with their network. They couldn't tell me why (their database doesn't have this information), so I assume then that it has something to do with the previous owner of this phone, or something about how it was refurbished, that has now made it incompatible."

Phone scree came with deep scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After only less than a week of having this phone and it working great, it started to restart randomly here and there. Not thinking much of it, I decided to leave it.

But it clearly visible sign of use (visible well beyond 12 in), and was missing all of the accessories it should come with.Really felt like a scam."

Very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Dura bien excelente hasta ahora va todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone was dead on arrival and I am fighting to get the refund. Avoid buying a refurbished or renewed phone. The product may have some internal issues that look fine on the surface but will fail, but you will be out of warranty. Sometimes those phones are not actual Apple Iphones either."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I got apple care when I bought my mom's phone. It covers battery runout and screen break. But I wanted to have additional warranty since my mom drops her phone like crazy. But additional apple care was so expensive that I eventually did not get it… and the private insurance was not worth it I heard... make it cheaper apple!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","purchased this exact green 256gb phone and i read after buying that you are guaranteed a minimum of 90% battery health and i got 91% and my reason for upgrading was to escape the battery deterioration on a previous iphone 11 at 86%he who expected nothing shall not be deceived.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Does the job just fine!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered this product though I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews, however, I was blown away by the perfect condition of the phone. I have now been using it for 2 months everyday and still, it works perfectly. I couldn’t ask for more!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Unlocked with 512GB of storage and it came in about 4-5 days. It was $869 which was a great price for it. There was a screen protector installed on it but I could see a small scratch/crack at the camera notch. When I removed the screen protector I found 5 or so scratches in various places on the screen. I can't see them at all when the display is on so I don't mind them for that, but I can see the scratches turning into cracks if it were to be dropped and so they just make the display a little more delicate.One of the biggest concerns I have (I may return it because of this) is that it's not under warranty anymore and that also means it's not eligible for AppleCare, so if something happens in the future, the motherboard fails, or display fails, then any of those costs will be something I have to cover which means it's entirely possible that if one or two major things go wrong in the next couple of years, that the money I saved from buying this renewed, would just be put into paying for potential fixes. Hopefully nothing like that happens but it's important to think about.I haven't noticed any dead pixels or anything else wrong with the phone. The cameras work, the lightning port always charges, all buttons work and it's now in the Apple Battery case, which has the camera button, which is fantastic!All in all, I think it's worth buying."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","i liked it"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Don’t buy a phone from them. I got my iPhone 11 Pro Max and the phone freezes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Having spent so much on a phone, I have some sort of regret. I wouldn't do it again that's for sure. The price has to come down in between $300 and $500 for me to know that the product was worth the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It's perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me agrado porque vino con protector de pantalla"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I cannot get rid of the 4 copies of contacts (over 4000 on this GD device now). I spent hours one evening cleaning them up, only to have them all reappear. Seriously?!The options are zero contacts or 4000 contacts.“Merge” does not work.Once this phone is dead, I’ll be going back to the Google phones.Terrible."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is renewed and used and costs more than a new one that I can get at apple's website or an apple store. I dont understand why, a lot of these Amazon Renewed phones are like this too. The phone is good I'm assuming, but I wouldnt buy it from here since it's about 200 dollars more expensive. What a scam this would be."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone was chipped and screen scratched. This is the first time we’ve had a problem buying a refurbished iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I mostly like it it was nothing I don’t like"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I loved the customer service because even when the phones speaker went bad they were there to help me out not like other brands.. shop with them you WONT REGRET It."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Terrible experience. Seller sent iPhone with the gaskets removed. These gaskets keep moisture out of the phone, especially moisture due to humidity. After a few months of use, this phone's cameras stopped working. Local repair shop informed us about the removed gaskets. Seller said that because it was outside of the 90 day window there was nothing they could do, despite defective product."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I purchased a phone form this seller, upon arrival i discovered that the phone was indeed not unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is so so so so incredibly good for me so can I please have a nother one for my sister for free please because that would be awesome."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is bad it is glitching and color switching and it looks nice but has problems with the screen lighting or idk wat you call it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is very shiny and the most important thing is that you can serf the web and make a phone call at the same time. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hi, my name is Tania and I like your product I can give a five star rating for one of your products."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is over priced for sure. It does a lot and is quick but give me a break, Apple just charges too much for their products."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","None of these phones make sense to purchase, esp, they are renewed and price for them are higher than is being sold on Apple for the same phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","it was coooooooool"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","JH"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I made a purchase of a renewed iPhone 11 Pro, 512Gb and they sold me a stolen phone, if I buy again will you sell me a stolen device?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came, turned on and allowed me to set it up for about 20 minutes before turning off. Tried to hard reset, plug into iTunes etc... Stuck on Apple logo. Not recommended"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It was in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery drain very fast please stay away"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La vida de la bateria cual es ?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The 13 just came out. This is not worth the listed price especially with all the negative comments about poor customer service. WOW $350 and maybe then we can talk."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I recoment this seller very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","They market this item as renewed, but in my case they simply slapped a screen protector on it. Take a look at what we received.I'm returning this for a replacement. If the next one is in the same condition, I will ask for a full refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good product"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It has three cameras"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lastima la caja. Y los artículos originales del celular. Muy mal que no viniera completa, y el servicio de envío se demoro."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","bought this based on reviews, turns out its crap, the sides are completely ruined and scratched, im leaving t go back to my country tomorrow so i cant return it, this is awful, i want a refund!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I recently noticed there are no patriot themed iPhones and now my son is throwing a tantrum thanks for ruining my wine night"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","READ THE DESCRIPTION !This comes with nothing original!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone came in poor condition, giant crack on screen...do not buy save your money"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iPhone 📱 it’s totally garbageDon’t buy don’t buyThanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So my experience with renewed premium has been a mixed bag. The value is pretty good , you get a year warranty on the phone which is what drew me to this program. But clearly the guarantees they give are not 100%, as i got my first iPhone with defective speakers and the second with 87% battery health. Physically, both phones were in great, nearly flawless condition which is great. Maybe the battery health of this phone was 90% when they packaged it a year or two ago and degraded, but I doubt it. A bit disappointing to be honest."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This product was brand-spanking new! So relieved and happy. I just can't bring myself to pay full price for what I really want, and this iPhone 11 Pro has me happy snappy. It said there would be minor scratches etc, not visible from arm's length, but I can't see any imperfections on this at all. Battery is great - I've done things like listen to a book for 3 hours, and at the end of the day, the battery was only 50% used. Very happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was needing a new phone and I found this renewed 11 Pro on Amazon. I knew it could have some flaws to the case. When it came I noticed one of the lenses was cracked. Kind of a circle crack. I waited to get it set up and take a picture to decide if I was going to keep it ior not. When I took a picture, the crack didn’t affect the quality of it at all. I was very pleased, so I decided I would be keeping it. I have since purchased a lens protector and put over the lens so it doesn’t get anymore damage."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I had purchased an XR a year ago and noted that it was just perfect. It replaced IPhone 7. Now I’m replacing another iPhone 7 for my wife. But I wanted to be farther from obsolescence so I found the 11 pro. It has worked as expected an it seems to slicker, thinner and shinier."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Just received so may update later but the phone came in physical great shape. The box included a generic cord and power box but did not include a SIM card pin like promised. The sticker over the camera left some goo that i thought for a moment was scratches, thankfully came off easily with a little cleaning. The battery health is 100%! All iPhone 11 Pros have it but the dual-SIM thing is really great (one eSIM and one physical SIM). I was upgrading from an iPhone 7, the main differences so far other than dual-SIM is the face recognition, battery health, screen size (the whole phone is a little bigger and heavier), speed of operation, and the camera of course is much nicer! So far happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I liked everything about this phone. Color, battery life, face recognition, and most of all no damage. I also had no problems putting my SIM card ( cricket ) in and it working right away. The only thing I could say that was an irritation was the fact that my texts didn’t transfer. But other than that awesome product. Thank you will be from this company again. 💯 percent satisfied!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","one tiny scratch on the back... but all good. Hooked up to my carrier. amazing quality, not what the seller did, its the phone... lets be honest... Seller did have quality product and not all scratched up.... so cudos..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","i got the green one and its more of a gray color tbh so i was a little sad abt that. theres a few scratches on the screen itself but theyre very small and it was also advertised and used so i expected it. everything works perfect no issues other than the color difference"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am still mainly using my old phone but, when I am using this one it works very well. There are a few places where there is visible damage but it is barely noticeable. Also, it came with a screen protector on it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This iPhone is in great condition, no damages or markings. I was extremely satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was very worried about ordering this phone on line but I gave it a try and no regrets. It arrived earlier then planned. And works just perfect and have no complaints. I am not phone savvy but surprisingly I was able to transfer my phone information over by my self and with in 25 min. I’m happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This “refurbished iPhone had to be brand new. There was not the slightest scratch anywhere on the phone front or back. The generic box had the word “new” on it. Battery was 92%. Quite happy am I."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love this phone! Not a mark on it, was able to transfer all my apps and data from old iphone 8+ in 10 min. Inserted SIM card and all is good ! Much better audio quality on calls, face recognition works well (unless I am wearing sunglasses or a mask)."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I like this iPhone 12 pro. This phone works great. I recommend for others. But i am first time iPhone user. I am not interested with small screen. Charging time is almost 2 hours to get full charge. My previous phone get full charged in 15 minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The equipment did not work, but they quickly accepted the return of the equipment"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is the second phone I purchased from Amazon and honestly, I wasn’t disappointed at all. The phone arrived quickly and in mint condition. It was gorgeous, battery life was at 100. I’ll definitely continue purchasing."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Is working well so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Amazon’s “renewed” packaging and boxing was good. But, it was a different story when I got to the phone. Someone had taken off the protective plastic film from the phone or a new plastic film to protect the phone's screen and back was never replaced in the ""renewing"" process. The result? The plastic film was beat-up and barely adhering to the phone. There was dust, finger prints and hair trapped under and on the plastic film. This phone either had a different owner between the original purchaser and me or, as I said before, they never replaced the plastic protective film when renewing. This is my first experience with a renewed product and it did not go well. This phone is going back to Amazon. I suggest that if you have any, even the slightest dissatisfaction, with any facet of this phone or any “renewed” item, you do not keep it and you send it back! Never again for me! I will only purchase new in the future. To avoid having a similar experience as me, you may consider doing the same."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó todo ok.Se ve bien el teléfono"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Used phone in New condition great value."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Perfect device, everything working, just a criticism, it could have come in the box."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone lasted 3 days. I put it to charge overnight and when I woke up the screen was black...I assumed it was dead and never actually charged, but then could feel vibrations from texts that were appearing on my watch and realized that the screen is just completely black. Nothing I could do would fix it so I had to return."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I really love this iPhone. At first I was scared to purchase based on the bad reviews that I read but trust me I bought it and no regrets. The phone is next to new, my only issue was that it has a battery life of 83% but it’s renewed so that’s expected. Value for money tho."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This is the second iPhone we purchased from Amazon my wife like it so much that I had to buy her one"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Very disappointed to get a phone that wasn’t cleaned and has some type of guck in the speaker. Has scratched and crack on bottom of the screen. I paid top dollar for what I thought would be an almost flawless phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It works perfectly fine battery life around 85-90 but it was way better than what I had before"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone arrived in great condition. 100% battery life, everything works. It has only small scratch at the edge of the corpus, but it's only visible in light at a specific angle. I'm still using a case, so couldn't care less. Great value."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Like new works great so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 Whatever they did to ""renew"" this iPhone wasn't very thorough. Furthermore, they shipped this very expensive iPhone in a bubble envelope versus a padded box. The display worked initially but then started flickering and next thing I know the display died. See video I posted.

The actual listing for this 512 GB iPhone advertised in the images a 1 year warranty (and still does) but seller would not honor it. Thankfully Amazon has 30 day return policy so that was honored so I have returned the iPhone back in the bubble envelope."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Came fast and product works great. Only a little scratch on the camera but battery life and screen are perfect ! :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It came fast and it’s in great condition! No deep scratches only micro scratches on the sides but I put a case on it and you can’t tell it’s a used phone at all!
I was able to update to iOS 14.6 and it’s super fast, face recognition is perfect, it’s compatible with basically any carrier.
I love it!! It was well worth the money and looks amazing ❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Honestly the box that this came in (not the amazon brown box but the iphone box inside) looked a little sketchy and I was afraid the phone wouldn't work but the phone has worked just fine so far! It had protective film over the front and back and mine even showed up with a glass screen protector already on it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro",":)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I got it in good condition was package very good and secure I love it the same way I went I updated my new phone right away with T-Mobile was very easy the volume was perfect the shape was good I love ❤️ so far so good was beautiful thank you 😊"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I need to up grade my iPhone. I like it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone works perfectly well! Long lasting battery life for a used phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Love it! It came early and it's exactly as described. It even came with a charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I found out the iPhone 11 I bought had been black listed that means it was either reported stolen or sold before it was paid off. It can’t get service until it is taken off the blacklist. It wasn’t a great price for a refurbished cell it’s an awful price for a blacklisted one. I hope Amazon will not let this company continue to sell stolen phones on their site. I should probably return it but I also don’t want to have to pay for a brand new phone while I wait to be reimbursed for this one. I am hoping to have it taken off the blacklist, they said I will have to wait 24 to 48 hrs. I am tired of going in to AT&T at this point."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Only issue I had was when taking pictures in lightened area the pictures comes out very poorly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El telefono viene tal como se describe y al menos en mi caso venia totalmente nuevo sin el mas minimo daño estetico y con el 100% de salud de la bateria"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It's really just a hit or miss. I knew purchasing a refurbished phone had its risks. I purchased mine, and I was pleasantly surprised. The phone did not come in an original box, nor did it come with original accessories, but I knew about that. The phone's condition was mint. You can't tell that it's been used, and mine came with a screen protector. Setting it up was really easy, but the main problem I had with is was the stiffness. I had a hard time opening the sim card tray, but it did end up working, and the volume down button was hard to push. Other than that, everything works fine. Battery life was 100%, unlocked, etc. So, if you're thinking about buying this, DO IT. At the end of the day, if you're unhappy with it, you can always return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone was perfect from the first moment that I charged it and turned it on. Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es un excelente producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batería venia con 90% de vida útil, pero. O importante"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It came scratched"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Even though I bought it not new it’s working pretty ok. It’s an iPhone, which means it’s something good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","When I first received the product, the front protective film has been attached. And I thought they were kind.
But when I turned on the flash light and inspected the product, I found the scratch. It's on the right side of the front camera.
I guess they put a film on to cover up those scratches.
I took a video and pictures of them.
And I would like seller to either replace it with a normal product or provide a quick return label."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A nice device , picture quality is great, looks great, water resistance is a plus for me.Fast processor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","91% battery life so not to bad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","As advertised. I bought the iPhone 11 Pro 512GB silver, unlocked. My AT&T sims card worked with this iPhone. The battery capacity came at 100%, which is like new, much better than my iPhone 6s Plus, 79%.

So far the phone works and I have no issues activating it, transferring my data from my old phone to this one, and adapting to the new updates. The sounds in calls and FT have been a little off, but hopefully it’s not the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I don’t like having to sign in to everything again. I can never remember my password which is why I loved the fingerprint option on my last one. This one doesn’t have it. So I need to reset some passwords but this happens with every new phone so it isn’t the phone’s problem, it is mine but I do love my new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I'm so happy with my phone. It came in earlier than expected. Kinda upset I had asked for a silver phone and got a grey one. But it doesnt matter anymore I love my phone lol."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am totally impressed, the iPhone looks and works like new, no scratches 5☆"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am not going to review the iPhone 11 Pro...there are a ton online for you to peruse. However, this Amazon refurbished example was literally like new. Well-packaged and in a secure mailer, it fired right up. Battery indicated at more than 90% after a deep charge.

I have no idea what the refurbishment process is but, when I ran Apples Diagnostics - everything was A-OK. Not much else to say other than to buy one and save!

PS: I can't speak for those who have had problems - but, that's the beauty of purchasing through Amazon, you can always send it back."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","So unhappy. Got the phone within the next day of ordering so I was so excited (originally had to wait 5ish days)! The phone came with no scratches or other visual defects, PERFECT! And then the set up came. It was terrible! Took 5 hours because I had to backup my phone to my laptop, and then download that backup to this iPhone. It would not do the quick setup because this iphone has no WiFi or Bluetooth capabilities! The WiFi is greyed out and the Bluetooth is forever loading. I contacted AppleCare and of course, IT’S A HARDWARE PROBLEM! Very unsatisfied. Does all of the other basic functions work? Sure. But my phone bill is going to be through the roof since I don’t have unlimited data. It shouldn’t have to be that way. I took a chance with amazon renewed because it says all devices passed all diagnostic tests, clearly they missed one. Never again. My seller was BuySPRY.

——— Update:

I am trying to find ways to fix this since returning the product would be a hassle. Tried a bunch of googled advice and it still doesn’t work. And now on the morning of Day 3, the apps aren’t loading properly and the phone doesn’t charge (I am using my own original iPhone charger) unless I turn the phone off and back on again. If it’s about the luck of the draw, I sadly drew the unlucky defective one."

I’m quite tech savvy as I’m 22 years old and even after changing my wifi and trying my hotspot and leaving to use someone else’s wifi, I was still unable to get past this. I tried rebooting it and everything you can think of. Unfortunately, it has to be returned.

It came in NON original packaging with a non Apple cube and a new wire. The iPhone was clean and crisp with no physical damage to the appearance. Also had brand new clear covering to prevent fingerprints while in packaging."

It charges EXTREMELY fast, the battery life is about 6 hours with constant use. The camera was dirty so I had to clean that off too haha but once I got everything clean and working it hasn’t given me a problem since. It’s a pretty good phone, I like it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was great it arrived dead so I thought it didn’t turn on but then I charged it and it was fine you can’t use the original Apple charger which is odd but other than that it was perfect"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was a little bit worried since I have seen mixed reviews and it is my first-time mobile purchase on Amazon. There are so many things to write about. The most important thing is I got it in 3 days though it is a pandemic situation. I thought it wouldn't be that good. But surprisingly it is like a new phone. I was worried about battery performance. But it is great as well. NO scratch, this one had the original cable and the charger which I didn’t expect. On top of that, it came with a screen protector. Thank you so much for this wonderful product at a reasonable price!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone was amazing since i first got it. I had my doubts on Renewed phones from Amazon but I am now reassured that renewed phones are legit and would recommend buying. My iphone had very minor signs of wear, signs that you really had to inspect very closely to see. so it was a well taken care of phone, popped in a screen protector and case and it was good as new. Battery was at 85%, if you're new to iphones like i was that is still a day and a half of battery life before next charge. I used it a fair amount of time maybe 2 hours of hulu each day and checking socials here and there and it lasted perfectly. Dont shy away if you're concerned for the 80%+/- battery life it is still an excellent percentage for anything."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","the phone is nice and clean, working like i expect it to."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono se encuentra en muy buen estado, igual a nuevo, le funciona todo no tiene ningun detalle

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Delivered as mentioned in the ad, the phone looked as new as it had nothing wrong, not only the outside but it also worked perfectly! It’s been 15 days now and I’m so happy about that! Thanks a lot!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Reconditioned Apple 11 Pro iPhone replaces my aging Apple 8S that decreasingly handles today's technology. Looks and works great for me, at half the cost of the brand new Apple 12 now selling. Encased in the Otterbox Defender Pro to keep it very well protected against damage (like my workplace Apple 8S iPhone). My only dislike is that the reconditioned 11 Pro battery quickly drains daily, so I have to recharge it at the end of the day everyday. But that was an advertised ""at least 80%"" capacity original battery, so no surprises there. I do not need, nor use, the fingerprint reader, and the sheerness is not a consideration for me, being encased in the protective cover."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Screen was scratched up badly"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen tamaño muy bien 😊"

Muy complacido con el vendedor y el estado del equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was actually very nervous to buy due to some bad reviews. But either I got really lucky, or Amazon renewed products are really decent! The screen doesn’t have one scratch. The battery health is at 93%. It’s 256 GB Just like I ordered. Everything works perfectly. But just in case it doesn’t, I bought a 2 year warranty. The phone is basically new. A lot of people with iPhones want to upgrade as soon as a new one comes out. Leaving very good and basically new phones to be sold as used. I recommend getting this if you need an upgrade. (I’m slow to upgrade phones. I’ll probably keep this until the iPhone 17 comes out) so far so good! I’ll update if anything changes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fast shipping looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone arrived faster than expected. Set up was really easy. Everything worked perfectly as described by the site."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I decided to get the pro because I thought the 11 would be too big, and i don’t regret my decision (i had an 8 before). The reduced price make this phone worth it."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The battery percentage is 85% I am disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Make sure you remove the screen protector, my screen looked fine, but i could notice something under it. I removed it and the screen was mauled, the scratches can be felt with your fingernail and seen even when the screen is on."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received the phone as promissed in good condition. Purchased this phone as a phone for traveling overseas. In a few days will be able to use it on my trip and emit a comment on its performance."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Over all I’ve found my renewed iPhone 11 Pro a very good and in excellent condition…no signs of wear and no issues, just learning it’s functions is all for me. I’d been without a cellphone for a longtime due to being home and just not needing one. I’ve found great support not only through online videos but also through Apple Care is there 100% to help you at no extra cost. I do recommend getting your security in place first thing! So glad I decided to avoid 5g phones with the emerging issues coming out! I’ll never buy a brand new cellphone again! Recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","After I read some reviews I was nervous that the phone was gonna come looking beat up and old, but it came in perfect condition. It was easy to set up, already fully charged, and to my luck there were no scratches or dents. The battery life is at 100% still which is awesome and it only took a week to ship out. Everything works perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have wanted the iPhone 11 Pro as an upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus because I love the camera upgrade. Surprisingly there is not a noticeable difference in the screen size but there is a definite difference in the phone size.
Also, I love the face recognition! Much better now that mask mandates are being relaxed.😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It was good"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was honestly very weary buying a refurbished iPhone online, especially with the negative reviews but I have to say I am so impressed. It came with no scratches no dents and 100% battery capacity!! Basically brand new. Highly recommend"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Funciona muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Thought my review could help someone like they did for me. I was kinda skeptical buying a refurbished phone but it came like it was brand new. They don’t let ppl trade in phones that are damaged at all so they come in great condition. The battery and camera and everything works great."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Do NOT buy this. I’ve only had my iPhone for 6 months there is a hardware issue and it got hacked. I’m trying to return it to either get my money back or have them send me a new phone but they denied it because it’s been past 90 days."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Amazzzzing product! Arrived 3 days earlier than expected, not a scratch, 100% battery capacity! I returned another phone I purchased from a different seller that was scratched, 80% capacity and 64GB for the same price!"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excellent!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone was 9/10. I am not giving it a 10 because when I received it the phone was dirty the speaker was full of dust and the phone looked like it was taken out of a phone case and not cleaned off. Everything works perfect.
I recommend the seller to clean the product before sending to customers"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todas las funcionas del teléfono al 100% y estéticamente excelente 👌"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono está prácticamente nuevo estéticamente, ningún raspón ni rayón en pantalla, ni en marcos ni en la parte trasera. Llegó con 93% de condición de batería, está muy bien para ser un teléfono del 2019, y en cuanto al funcionamiento, impecable, ninguna falla hasta ahora, vale la pena la compra el único detalle son los costos de importación en caso de comprar desde México."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Entiendo que es un teléfono reacondicionado pero desde la configuración decía que no funcionaba el FaceId. Pensé que lo podía solucionar una vez que lo configurara, pero terminar de copiar mi teléfono a este que compré el Face ID siguió sin funcionar.

Busque en internet y todo pero había una falla de la cámara, por eso decidí mejor regresarlo porque por mi trabajo, es súper práctico usar el FaceId"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego muy bien empaquetado, sin un solo detalle estético y con batería en 97%. Simplemente no se puede pedir más. Satisfecho al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone me llegó más rápido del tiempo que marcaba el rastreo de paquetes, me llegó con batería al 94% sin ningún rasguño en la superficie del teléfono. Los artículos con los que venía era una plumilla pero extraer el chip, cable y cargador, aun que no son originales funcionan bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente batería, se ve muy completo a excepción de la cámara que es el único lugar en el que se nota el uso pero mínimamente. 😃 si algo le llega a fallar editaré el comentario para avisar 😁.
Yo creo que comprar Renewed es cuestión de suerte! Pero definitivamente con Renewed Premium hay mayor seguridad y los estándares de calidad son mas altos 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía duda de que no me llegará esta compra, pero llegó en la fecha estimada de llegada, sin problemas, el equipo tenía una caja con un cargador (cuadro) y el cable para poder cargar el dispositivo, la batería llegó con el 80% , se entiende que no son dispositivos nuevos, si no reacondicionadas. En lo fisico solo vienen un rayón en su carcasa en la parte superior izquierda, por el color no se nota mucho, pero todo lo demás el equipo esta en buenas condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iphone llegó rápido, en una caja de Amazon con un certificado de calidad y de inspección, tiene garantía de un año y luce completamente nuevo, cable y cargador nuevos genéricos. La batería con 93% de vida. Recomiendo ampliamente los productos REACONDICIONADOS PREMIUM ya que estos sí son respaldados por Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ya se calienta cuando está mucho tiempo en actividad, y eso que no juego, a 2 semanas que lo compre."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Compra buena"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo unos 3-4 meses con el teléfono, me llego con el 87% de batería, no se calienta ni ha tenido ninguna falla. Lo recomiendo la verdad"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego rápido, en buen estado, excelentes condiciones! Recomendable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono en general está bien aunque cuenta con un rayón muy llamativo en la pantalla, lo único que si me disgustó mucho a comparación de otros comentarios es que solo contó con un 81% de vida la pila, cuando otros cuentan que viene incluso hasta con 95, 96% aprox."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto parece total mente nuevo el único problema era el nivel de vida de la batería llegó con un 79% pero aún así me dura todo el día, 100% recomendado quede encantado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo es reacondicionado pero viene impecable, todo completamente nuevo y original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó bien sellado y en una caja genérica. Cuenta con algunos detalles estéticos como algunos rayones en el cromo, pero de ahí en fuera, funciona todo y a la perfección.
Si lo compras en oferta, no te arrepentirás.

Debido a que es re acondicionado, puede que tenga algunos detalles."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es un dispositivo que destaca en la gran mayoría de situaciones, con buena calidad de cámara, batería, pantalla, tamaño compacto y sonido. Sin embargo de lo que se debe hablar es de los dispositivos reacondionados, fue mi primer experiencia comprando, pero para mi suerte fue gratamente satisfactorio, como se ve en las fotos es un dispositivo que llego con sus huellas de uso, incluso alguna caída que pudo haber sufrido pero después de casi dos meses probando el dispositivo ha funcionado como nuevo. En cuanto a la batería si llego con 84% de batería lo cual no me agrado pero con el descuento por el cual me lo compré poco podía decir, Apple ofrece cambio de la batería en $1700 por tanto podría ser ese gasto a considerar, sin embargo en dos meses ha bajado 1% el porcentaje de la batería y en su estado actual me da al rededor de 6 horas de pantalla por lo cual me rinde a mi casi todo el día, si fuera necesario yo recomiendo esperar a que llegue al 80% de estado en la batería para su cambio, y realmente así como va fácilmente puedes durar todo un año con esa batería. Por otra parte recomiendo analizar el número de serie y descargar 3Utools para que hagan su propia revisión, en mi caso vinieron todas las partes originales de serie, hasta donde se puede ver. Yo como les mencione en el título recomiendo que compren con BuySPRY, en mi caso todo ha ido perfecto y con la confianza de Amazon, sus tres meses de garantía así como la disponibilidad de piezas que te provee Apple, estoy muy contento."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo compré para regalarlo a mi mamá, llegó aparentemente bien, sin rayones ni señales de mucho uso. La capacidad de la batería era del 82% (lo cual cumple con lo prometido en la publicación), el tema es que se calienta un poco luego de unos minutos de uso y la ubicación por gps es muy intermitente e inexacta."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sin detalles, me llegó casi nuevo.
95% de pila y todo funcionando al 100% en esta primera semana de uso"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó esteticame te impecable, todo funciona muy bien y la batería considero que está en buena condición 86%. Muy recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Como nuevo, excelentes condiciones y excelente empaquetado supero mis expectativas, obviamente por ser reacondicionado no esperes la caja original del iPhone pero por el precio lo vale, las cajas se terminan tirando."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have 4 stars only because it said excellent condition and there was scratches on the side of the phone in a few areas that were quite noticeable. The phone charger it came with charged it extremely slow to the point where it took almost 24 hrs of being plugged in to fully charge. I ended up buying an additional fast charge cord for it instead of using the generic one given. The phone overall is great no issues there. However the battery life was at 87% once again a bit low for something considered excellent condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This product is great. Every feature works perfectly and battery is at 100% capacity. It’s not 5 stars cause when I removed the included screen protector there were a bunch of scratches. However, since I only use my phone with screen protectors and it completely covers up said scratches, this personally isn’t a big dealbreaker to me. If having scratches at all is a big deal to you, just giving you a warning that your iPhone may come with scratches. Other than that, I’m satisfied with the product :). And yes, the iPhone is real, no other damage besides that"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Solo llego con un pequeño raspon o desgaste en la esquina ... Se le descarapelo el cromo pero nada importante... Esperaba mas rallones o problemas... Lo que mas me preocupaba era el funcionamiento... Pero hasta la fecha marcha todo bien...llego con 100 de batería , lo recomiendo si buscas algo bueno bonito y barato.... Viendo esto creo q nunca me animare a comprar un iphone nuevo... La verdad vienen como nuevos y con garantia... Pocaa pero un vendedor particular no da garantía ni financiamiento a msi"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Actualizo:
Wilmer, de servicio al cliente, me ayudó para gestionar la devolución considerando la garantía de los 90 días. No podría estar más satisfecho con Amazon.

Sin embargo el producto que recibí sigue siendo igualmente malo, así que solo subí un poco la calificación.

Los motivos de mi evaluación tan baja son:

Pésimo estado:
- Conector lightning atascado de pelusa y mugre. Igual las bocinas
- Rayones en la panalla que son visibles,
- Rayones en las esquinas del telefono que son evidentes a un brazo de distancia.
- Batería al 84 % pero se drena por completo en menos de medio día (desconecto a las 8 para las 12 del día a está muerto),
- Se calienta al cargar via cable,
- Se calienta aún más al cargar via inalámbrica,
- Sin haberlo usado nunca (en estos dos meses) en ambientes húmedos o haberlo mojado, es frecuente que marque alerta de ""agua en el conector""... así que me quedo sin pila y no lo puedo cargar por horas
- El Face ID deja de funcionar y tengo que desactivarlo, reiniciar el telefono, volver a registrar Face ID y volver a habilitar cada aplicación en la que lo uso .

No encuentro aún cómo hacer válida la garantía Amazon pero preferiría devolverlo..."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad había escuchado mucho sobre los reacondicionados y tenia algo de temor que no fuera a recibir un producto en buen estado, cual fue mi gran sorpresa me llego el Iphoneen caja genérica plastificada como si fuera de fabrica, al sacarlo de la caja quede fascinado el Iphone me llego como nuevo sin ningún raspón en en ningún lado, ni en pantalla, muy bien cuidado la bateria la 92% tengo ya 20 dias con el y no me ha fallado para nada los primeros días por motivos de trabajo por mas o menos una semana tuve que darle un uso muy intenso con la red compartiendo datos con mi laptop lo cual en todo los celulares provoca que se calienten de mas y las baterías se agoten mas rapido pasa en todos este no fue la excepcion lo q ocasiono q si lo cargaba un un dia y medio y eso que soy usuario intenso de twitter, facebook, instagram tik tok lo cual consumen mas rapido la bateria compartir datos hizo q lo cargara una vez al dia aun asi paso muy bien esas pruebas de uso intenso, hice también validaciones con 3utools todo es original nada a a sido sustituido incluyendo la bateria es la misma de fabrica en cuanto a su desempeño a pesar de que es un iphone de hace 3 años no se queda atras al 2022 sigue dando batalla con holgura, en cuanto a sus camaras siguen siendo de las mejores camaras que hay, las fotografias nocturnas o videos nocturnas salen excelentes en condiciones de poca luz, incluso puede lograr astrofotografia en campos abiertos lejos del ambiente citadino si piensan comprar uno y o lo compre con el vendedor ""electron de mexico"" me dejo maravillado con este reacondicionado en excelente estado como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buena relación calidad/precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Que está en óptimas condiciones y que trabaja bien las Apps"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","amazing service, phone is like brand new.Great battery health , no scratches and fully unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó antes de lo programado
Excelente embalaje
Batería al 100% de su capacidad
Accesorios genéricos
Sin detalles estéticos
Pendiente uso de SIM
Hasta el momento muy satisfecha."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was a bit hesitant to pay over $1K for a refurbished iPhone 11 Pro, but did want a better camera, etc. and did not want to upgrade to the brand new extremely expensive iPhone 12 Pro. I was also a bit disappointed with the iPhone 12 features and new unrounded sides, so felt this was a reasonable gamble to upgrade for the next few years until 5G actually becomes useful and the next 5G chipset in iPhone is more power-efficient. The really beautiful forest green colour added to the desirability, nicer than the 2020 iPhone 12 colour options in my opinion.
The item was unavailable and then back-ordered for a few weeks, but then magically arrived 2 weeks before I expected! I'm very happy with the refurb unit I received - there are no scuffs, dents or other problems - looks like brand new and this 11 Pro has new options with the new wide angle lens for taking lovely pictures. The battery also holds a full charge. They did add a screen protector to the front which makes me wonder if there was a scratch on the screen or some other issue, but the screen looks fine and works flawlessly. I just popped my SIM chip in from my old phone and then transferred all my settings and data over from my old iPhone.
Note that the included phone charger and cable are not Apple items, but an equivalent that works fine. Also, you will not receive an Apple iPhone box containing the refurbished phone - it comes in the vendor's own box with setup instructions, etc.
NOTE: make sure you read the Apple Support article (support.apple.com) on how to properly transfer your settings and data from your old phone to make the process as easy as possible - it will save you a lot of time and effort. Also, make sure you log out of Find My, Messages and iCloud on the old phone *before* you do a final Reset.
Follow-up: I have been using my iPhone 11 Pro for over a month now and everything is great - no issues or regrets. I'm happy I saved a lot of money taking this upgrade route."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto por lo pagado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es una excelente compra, me llego sin detalles estéticos, con una mica ya incluida y batería al 98% sin lugar a duda 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tengo 3 semanas con el equipo, funciona bien, la batería dura Perfecto. El cargador que me llego es genérico pero funcione bien en carga rápida. El único tema es que trae un rayón visible en una esquina."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En general viene en buen estado, el detalle está en la batería que viene al 83%, que, puede que no sea redituable para mí en el futuro, ya que tendré que cambiarla y no es muy barato. Ahora tendré que pensar si debo cambiarlo o conservarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Creo que todos tuvimos miedo al comprar un teléfono refurbished pero en mi experiencia es una muy buena forma de ahorrar dinero y de cuidar el ambiente
El teléfono no presenta detalles más los descritos (pequeños raspones) muy contento con mi compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego bien empaquetado, trae accesorios genéricos pero funcionales (Cable y cargador). La pantalla presenta leves rayones que no interfiere en el funcionamiento del dispositivo, son pocos perceptibles a la vista, nada que no se solucione con una mica templada o protector de pantalla. La esquina inferior derecha tiene un rayón, nada que no se solucione con una funda (Case, protector...). La salud de la batería es de 84%, nada mal para un equipo del 2019, la duración de la batería depende de lo que estés realizando en el dispositivo, pero en general me dura casi todo el día.

Este iPhone lo compre para cambiar mi iPhone 7. La salud de la pila de este dispositivo se deterioro mucho, en menos de una hora me quedaba sin pila. El micrófono no servía, no podía hacer llamadas, excepto conectando unos audífonos bluetooth. Además, el iPhone 7 ya no es compatible con iOS 16. Por cierto, mi iPhone 7 también es Reacondicionado y me duro bastante.

Fue una buena compra, estoy satisfecho con el iPhone 11 Pro..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Esta opinión la estoy realizando después de usar por 1 año el iPhone. Cuando lo compre tenía daños de uso, nada fuera de lo normal, me encanto, lo recomendio bastante. SIN EMBARGO, cuando me lo vendieron tenía 93% de pila de vida y ahora solo le queda 77%….."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto es seminuevo pero en buen estado relativamente ya que se le ven rayones en las esquinas, el cargador no es original y viene dentro de caja cualquiera. Vino con un 79% de batería de vida 💔👎🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pues el equipo se siente bien ala mano y muy práctico de usar.."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nunca había comprado un celular re acondicionado y tenía mucho temor de lo que me iba a llegar. Mi celular llegó como nuevo, únicamente tenía un pequeño raspón en la parte de donde se carga pero fuera de eso, estaba intacto. La batería estaba al 90% y ya llevo 9 meses usándolo sin ningún problema. No aconsejo comprar el seguro como yo lo hice pues realmente no lo utilice, nunca te mandan muy bien la póliza y no tengo muy claro de a dónde tengo que acudir en caso de que le pase algo. Por el tiempo que tengo ahorita con el celular pienso cambiarlo en unos meses y ya nunca usé el dichoso seguro. Ya pensándolo bien, creo que si no tienes una tarjeta de banamex con la que sacar un iPhone en la modalidad iPhone for life que creo que vale la pena por el monto decente al mes, comprar un Rea condicionado es una muy buena alternativa. Puedes comprar un equipo un poco más premium a un súper precio. 100% recomendado!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo excelente nomás la pantalla tiene un ligero rayón"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo compre, llego en buen estado. Han cambiado la parte trasera del iPhone y no hay problema con eso. El único detalle que tiene después de más de un mes de uso es que el micrófono no se escucha muy fuerte desde el primer día que lo recibí, cuando hablo con otra persona tienen que subir el volumen al máximo para escucharme. El celular fuera de eso me llego con un 99% de vida de batería, se ve bien y no tiene ninguna otra falla así que decidí quedármelo a pesar del detalle del micrófono. Si lo recomendaría se entiende que es reacondicionado y por el precio es una buena opción (lo compre en primeday en 480dls aproximadamente)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo bueno:
Llegó en un día, incluye cargador y cable usb normal a lightning (lo que me gustó mas ya que se me hace más practico que el usbc-lightning).
Esteticamente le pondria un 9.8 tiene una leve rayita imperceptible basicamente en el área de cámaras (no en los lentes) y los marcos se acero se manchan con el sudor y con las huellas digitales pero se quitan con una linpiada, no se si sea normal.
En el funcionamiento perfecto. En la cámara también.
Traia puesto una mica de cristal templado, lo que se agradece mucho.
Los contras:
Siento que la bocina frontal duena distorsionada y cuando esta a volumen alto saca aire lo que me hace pensar que ya no es resistente al agua ya wue por ahi podria entrar.
La bateria esta al 81% de su capacidad original por lo que si siento una duración menor a la que esperaba.
Considerando que es un reacondicionado y que lo compre en un orecio bajo en el hot sale la verdad es que estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono viene en muy buenas condiciones estéticas, no se notan rayaduras en la parte estética, la batería 82% al raz de lo que se indica en la publicación el único detalle fue con el altavoz de la parte superior que llegó defectuoso pero de ahí en fuera todo correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","To start, this is one of the best phone I have used!

Even though it was a refurbished phone. The quality was 100%. Not a single scratch/dent/marks nor anything. Truly brand new quality. So, I was very impressed when I received the product.

The box didn't have the Apple branded cable and cube charger but I am totally ok with that.

The metal body gives it a really premium feel on touch, as it is Gorilla Glass back and front with stainless steel frame. The phone is IP68 dust/water resistant but I never try to test it.

The display is an Super Retina XDR OLED, HDR10, Dolby Vision with 800 nits (typ), 1200 nits (peak). With such high quality I am still not used to this small 5.8 inches screen. Even though it has 458 ppi density.

The Apple A13 Bionic chip makes everything so lightning fast, multi-tasking is a breeze.

The 3 front cameras are as follow:
12 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.55"", 1.4µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS
12 MP, f/2.0, 52mm (telephoto), 1/3.4"", 1.0µm, PDAF, OIS, 2x optical zoom
12 MP, f/2.4, 120˚, 13mm (ultrawide), 1/3.6""

Everything makes it look so nice, bright. It is true what they said. iPhone makes taking a nice picture a breeze. It makes sure you can take a quality picture everything you press the button. Without adjusting anything. Just click and that's it. Same with the selfie camera in its quality. Just superb quality!

Stereo speakers is really ggood as well.

The Li-Ion 3046 mAh battery will last for 2-3 days based on my daily use.

Really like the phone, good quality. But definitely over-priced compare to other phones out there in now 2021 market."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es la primera vez que compro algo Reacondicionado, llevo 8 días usándolo y en general considero fue una buena compra.

El equipo llegó bien empaquetado, no es la caja original (como podrán observar en las imágenes) pero cumple su función de protegerlo, el celular tiene detalles mínimos en los costado, como de uso normal cuando no le colocas una carcasa recién comprado, la pantalla tiene detalles pero igual son casi imperceptibles y no se sienten al tacto, para mi no hay problema alguno respecto a eso. Repito, llevo 8 días usando el celular y hasta el momento todo bien, funciona como nuevo, el único detalle es que la Capacidad máxima de la batería es de 87%, aun que tampoco es tan malo para mi.

Las únicas razones por las cuales no le doy 5 estrellas es porque el adaptador de corriente (el cuadrito) no funciona bien, como mencionan en la descripción tanto el adaptador como el cable USB (cargador) no son originales y el adaptador se siente y se ve de muy mala calidad, eso y por la capacidad máxima de la batería.

Recomiendo que siempre lean las reseñas, con base a ellas fue que decidí comprar el celular con este proveedor y hasta el momento no me arrepiento, mas adelante escribiré otra reseña porque 8 días de uso es relativamente poco tiempo.

Nota: En la imagen en donde se ve el logo, la manzana no tiene ningún detalle, sólo es una mancha de mis dedos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto para el precio que esta publicado, lo pedi con temor de que saliera defectuoso, tengo 2 semanas con el y ha funcionado perfecto. Tiene detalles minimos en la parte posterior de la camara que solamente se ven si te acercas detalladamente. La bateria venia al 84% por lo que no le pongo las 5 estrellas. Fuera de eso. Me parece un excelente producto. Viene en caja de carton generica con cargador y cable genericos que funcionan bien.
En conclusion, cumple con las expectativas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tiene estética de 10 y la batería tiene una capacidad del 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego sin la caja de iPhone, llego antes de tiempo y ha funcionado bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La descripción e incluso en las especificaciones de la caja decía que venía con arriba del 90% de condición de batería la cual no cumplió, y venía con el 85%.
5% es bastante en un celular de esta marca"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Súper relación precio calidad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad es que el producto llego un día después de lo esperado pero llego bien empaquetado, incluía un cubo y cable (no se ven de muy buena calidad) pero se agradece que traiga, el dispositivo llego con 83% en batería pero eso depende de cada iPhone, los bordes están muy bien cuidados al igual que la parte trasera y cámaras, por enfrente llego con mica de cristal ( tiene dos ligeros rayones en la pantalla ) pero nada que realmente afecte. Pagas por un producto “usado” pero de buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Compra justa, sin embargo tienes que tener suerte para que llegue un equipo con buen porcentaje de batería, eso si del 80% no baja.
A mi me llego con un porcentaje del 83%, la verdad tiene detalles mínimos, debes ponerle mucha atención para percatarte de ellos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batería su capacidad al 87% no me gusto, por lo demás, teléfono impecable y funciona perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El cel está impecable, parece nuevo, el único detalle es que el cable del cargador que viene duro un par de meses y tuve que comprarlo nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es una excelente oportunidad, sin embargo microfono y bocina estan dañados, me hubiera gustado que mencionaran eso en la descripción, todo lo demas funciona perfecto, es muy normal en los iphone ese detalle.

recomiendo ampliamente, volvería a comprar sin duda."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hola, el producto llego en perfectas condiciones, pero con una batería al 84%, todo lo demás al 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó en muy buen estado, y me pareció un excelente precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batería llegó con un poco más de 85% de vida y el teléfono se ve en buen estado sin golpes, lo único que no me agrado fue que tenía unas ligeras manchas en la parte de atrás, estás solo son visibles si inspecciones a fondo el teléfono."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Agarre una súper promo en hotsale, todo iba bien cuando me llegó hasta que escuche la bocina de las llamadas y sonaba volada, lo iba a regresar hasta que lo lleve a apple y sólo era limpieza lo revisaron y lo evaluaron 10 de 10 y batería al 100% hasta ahora todo ok, la neta me raye"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Una buena opción para adquirir un iPhone sin pagar tanto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó antes de lo esperado.
Por el momento muy bien, no noté ningún rayón en la pantalla ni en el cuerpo del equipo, parece literalmente nuevo! Y además de eso la capacidad de la batería esta al 99% así que ninguna queja, hare un update si algo cambia o noto algún inconveniente, hasta el momento todo perfecto.

UPDATE 1 de noviembre del 2022

Después de 5 meses de uso la capacidad máxima de la batería se ha reducido drásticamente en un 10% de ser del 99% ahora está al 89% me parece que ha decrecido de forma exponencial a pesar de que cuido mucho los ciclos de carga del teléfono, esto ya no me está encantando como al principio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pues para el precio creo que pueden ofrecer un mejor producto, apenas lo recibí hoy pero los detalles son notorios más un rayón en la pantalla que es muy visible a la luz de día y a la luz de la pantalla, lo probaré una semana porque llego con 88% de batería entonces veré si vale la pena la estética"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad dude en comprar un teléfono reacondicionado, pero salió bien, está como nuevo y con 95 de batería que es la que me preocupaba, lo recomiendo hasta ahorita sin ningún detalle…"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","excelente producto, unico detalle ligero rayon en pantalla pero en lo demas 10/10. La bateria llego en 85%, Face id funcionando perfectamente.
En general el equipo no me ha dado ningún problema, facil dura la bateria el dia entero con uso moderado, tiempos de carga acorde y no tienen ningún sobre calentamiento. Con una funda que proteja completo al equipo queda perfecto, recomiendo ampliamente el producto y al vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto estéticamente se ve bien, venía con un protector de pantalla que inteligentemente cubría un rayón en la parte superior de la pantalla, pero el gran problema son las bocinas, o están voladas o simplemente se escuchan mal y poco, tengo un mes con él y pensé que no iba afectar esa situación, pero cada que pongo una llamada en altavoz simplemente se escucha muy bajo y con ruido y aunque dice que uno puede devolver en los 90 días para solicitar un cambio o devolución, no se muestra ninguna opción para realizarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Comparto mi experiencia del producto.
Me llegó con la pantalla intacta sin ningún rayon notable al igual que la parte trasera, no obstante los marcos en la parte superior e inferior tenian dos abollones que supongo son marcas de alguna caida. La condición de la pila estaba a un 81%, eso no me gustó tanto la verdad ya que mi actual iPhone a 4 años de tenerlo consta del 78% y no es gran diferencia.
Venia con el cargador (bastante generico) y el cable de datos, faltó la herramienta para sacar la tarjeta Sim.

Al momento de querer transferir mis datos al finalizar me mostraba un mensaje de “No se pudo encontrar Iphone” y tenia de borrar todo y empezar de nuevo.
Por esos detalles decidí regresarlo e iniciar el proceso de reembolso."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hay un detalle muy pequeño que solo se ve muy de cerca y con un protector de pantalla ya no se ve"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The volume up button does not work other that that great quality."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Gran compra, dudé en la calidad y estado de batería y llegó con 99% pero es prácticamente nuevo. Recomendado 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Resiste lo que sea, se me ha caído el iPhone muchas veces y sigue impecable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","en si, es un muy buen celular, el color es muy bonito un tamaño que lo hace cómodo para traer en la mano, y por el precio hacen que tengas un teléfono relativamente nuevo con la diferencia al comprarlo a un desconocido, de que tienes una empresa que respalda con garantía limitada, pero una garantía; los detalles son que prometían un minimo del 90% en condición de bateria y llego con un 88%, venia la pantalla con rayones superficiales, no profundos pero si visibles los cuales no afectan el funcionamiento del teléfono solo estética, y tampoco traía la herramienta de extracción de la tarjeta SIM, detalle al parecer poco importante, pero si no tienes otro, andas buscando alfileres o clips cada vez que necesites quitar la tarjeta."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hasta el momento bastante sorprendida, tardo un poco en llegar pero parece nuevo, viene con batería al 98%, la estética de 10. Voy a continuar utilizándolo, si se mantiene así cambiare a 5 estrellas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 Tengo casi un mes con el teléfono, no había escrito mi experiencia porque quería revisar que todo funcionara y por ahora todo está perfecto.
El único detalle que encontré al recibirlo fue que la caja en la que llego, estaba semi abierta; en cambio, la caja que venía dentro con el teléfono estaba en perfecto estado.
Llego con los accesorios descritos en la publicación, cargador y cable genéricos funcionando.
Llego sin mica protectora y con super mínimos detalles en la pantalla, relativamente imperceptibles.
La batería al 100% de su capacidad.
Botones, sensores y cámara funcionando perfectamente.
Si durante el tiempo de garantía sucediera algo, editaré mi reseña. Por ahora recomiendo el producto."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono venia con unos pequeños rayoncitos en la pantalla pero solo se notaban con la pantalla apagada y en ciertos ángulos con la luz. Cuando le puse el protector de pantalla de cristal, es como si hubieran desaparecido, no se notan para nada.
La vida de la batería venia en 95%, que no esta tan mal considerando que solo te garantizan el 90%.
El cargador con el que lo entregan es genérico y no es de carga rápida, pero funciona perfecto y se ve de buena calidad.
Fuera de eso, el teléfono esta perfecto, no he tenido ningún problema, funciona de maravilla y por el precio, vale mucho la pena, sí lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batería, los costados un poco gastados"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ya había comprado productos Reacondicionados así que decidí comprar el iPhone 11 Pro, Tiene algunos detalles como rayones en la pantalla pero son ligeros que no afecta en su funcionamiento, también en la parte de atrás pareciera que tiene manchas o rayones pero igual manera no se ve a simple vista y con una funda no se ve, la verdad tiene pocas cosas malas, lo bueno el precio por lo que recibí, batería al 92%, estética de 9, la verdad es buena compra, además tiene garantía por parte de Amazon por si se presenta un fallo, o bien un mes más por parte del proveedor directamente. Si llega a pasarle algo al celular por algún mal funcionamiento actualizaré mi comentario."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en buen estado, en cuanto a estética todo súper bien sólo que en la pantalla venían algunos rayones muy mínimos no afecta en nada puedo decir que esta 9.8 de estética. la batería llegó al 89% llegó en 3 días a Mexico. Precio $10,199 es pequeño de 5.8 pulgadas me imaginé que sería más grande. Es mi primera vez usando IPhone y puedo decir que lo recomiendo ampliamente. Espero no aplicar la garantía y que me siga funcionando al 100% ya llevo un mes y no me ha presentado ninguna falla."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buena compra, el teléfono estéticamente de 10, la bocina algo dañada pero por el precio no me quejo, en 3 meses todo lo demás funciona Perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo viene bien,tiene detalles estéticos muy leves que con la funda no se perciben , sólo venía con un cargador genérico y la batería venía a una capacidad del 85% , dura un día y medio aprox.
La verdad es que tenía mucho miedo por los malos comentarios, pero me toco buena suerte , creo que lo volvería a comprar; espero les ayude mi comentario."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Delivery on time… battery life on phone underwhelming, takes great photos for the generation of phone. Over happy the phone other then battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buena relacion calidad precio.
El articulo pese a que se Renew, llego en muy buenas condiciones tanto esteticas, como de funcinamiento.
La bateria con un estado de salud mayor al 90%. Al momento con telcel y At&t funciona sin problema.

El unico contra que no tiene compatibilidad para funcional con la banda de telefonia 28, por lo que si eres usuario de altan o alguna OMV (Pillophone, Newww, Bait, etc) que funcione con las redes de altan, no podras usarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","13/10/22 :| sin duda una oferta tentadora a primera vista, un precio accesible por un teléfono de tan alta gama. ¿A qué costó? tu suerte, el teléfono puede ser un 10/10, impecable, sin detalles. O, puede ser también un 1/10, deteriorado, golpeado, raspado y desgastado. Lamentable el segundo fue mi caso, todos los botones tallados y el teléfono constantemente a alta temperatura, la condición de la batería en un 77% marcando “mantenimiento”. No dudo que puedan salir buenos teléfonos de ésta atractiva oferta, pero no fue mi caso. Estoy en proceso de devolución. ¿Mi recomendación? Buscar lo original, nuevo y garantizado; en mi caso, me decanté por adquirir el iPhone 13 mini en la página oficial. Saludos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto solo que en las llamadas se escucha muy distorsionada y grave la voz. Y también se calienta en algunas ocasiones, sin necesidad de mucho uso."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego con rayones en la pantalla bastante visibles pero muy pocos y en la orilla así que no afectan en realidad con una mica pasan desapercibidos, esperaba que me llegara con un 90 de batería pero llego con un 82 sin embargo no a bajado de ahí desde hace un mes de ahí en fuera parece nuevo satisfecho con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La bocina suena mal, entiendo que es ""renewed"" pero entonces tampoco cumple con su estándar de revisión y renovación."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Esta bueno el producto solo tengo duda con la carga de la batería ya que creo que le dura poco tal vez la batería no esté al 80% como lo describian"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","👍👍👍👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente equipo, lo único que le veo de malo es que la pila me marca al 86% de capacidad, pero no afecta que afecte su funcionamiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llega bien empacado. El equipo que me llegó tiene ligeros rayones en los marcos, con una funda se eliminan. La pantalla igual tiene rayones, ninguno profundo, viene con una mica y se vuelven imperceptibles. Cámaras, pantalla, sensores, bocinas y botones en buen estado, viene con cargador y cable genérico. Batería al 85% de vida. Lo único que no me gustó fue que no soporta la banda 28 entonces no es compatible con Altan."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tengo 3 meses con el equipo y funciona muy bien, de estética solo tenía un rayon sobre un costado pero el resto como si fuera nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó justo en el tiempo que me habían dicho, sin embargo, a la hora de abrir el producto no venía ningún papel que decía que era certificado o algo así, únicamente el equipo (con una protección tenue y envuelto en papel) y el cable de carga con el adaptador. No me llegó el gancho para sacar la sim.Internamente el teléfono llegó bien, nada se traba y con un 83% de batería (esperaba más pero el anuncio era claro). Sin embargo, la pantalla estaba bastante rayada de los laterales y era bastante notorio a un brazo de distancia.En general bien, pero por el precio que se pago (12,800 mxn) esperaba una pantalla intacta."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good for the price, battery 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En funcionalidad al 100. Estética si deja mucho que desear. Pero en fin, eso lo sabíamos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo viene en muy buenas condiciones, con excepción del eliminador de corriente del cargador, ya que, sobrecalienta el equipo y a medida que lo usas se calienta demasiado. Cambiándolo por un eliminador original el teléfono dejó de sobrecalentarse. El estado de la batería venía con un 98% de retención de carga y a medida del tiempo (Un par de meses) se redujo a 88%. Cosa normal considerando que es un equipo reacondicionado y estuvo apagado por demasiado tiempo, con el tiempo arrojó la retención real de bateria."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto se entiende que es reacondicionado, solo trae un pequeño detalle en el cristal de la pantalla un rayón pero muy pequeño como que no tenía mica protectora, la pila tiene una vida del 97% funciona muy bien y por el precio que pague estoy conforme ya que se siente la calidad de los productos apple he tenido también gamas alta de android a decir verdad siempre me han durado mas los iphones, por eso esta vez quise volver a esta marca, se que mucha gente desconfía de lo reacondicionado al menos aquí en Amazon he obtenido buenos productos, me da mucha confianza comprar aquí"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al igual que muchos, tenia duda al hacer la compra de un producto que no es completamente nuevo, el leer comentarios de estafas o malos productos te deja mucho que desear; decidí hacerlo para probar la experiencia de Amazon con productos reacondicionados y me sorprendió la respuesta.El producto llego mucho antes de lo esperado, el paquete contiene todo acorde a las especificaciones del vendedor tal cual como aparece en la descripción, con estética de 9 casi como nuevo ( diminutos rasguños de uso en los bordes ) pero estamos consientes que no es un producto nuevo, la condición de la batería es del 90% bastante decente para un producto que no es nuevo. En general todo le funciona a la perfección hasta el momento; antes de que termine la garantía de Amazon regresare a reportar como continua el funcionamiento del equipo después de tiempo.Buena relacion precio beneficio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","pues nunca había comprado un producto reacondicionado y decían unos usuarios que era un riesgo . y por lo menos en mi caso este producto salió muy bueno , nada de fallas y nada casi nada de detalles estéticos , yo estoy contento con este producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular realmente estaba nuevo por que tenía el 100 %en estado de capacidad de batería más no me agrado que lo mandaron con protector de cristal ya puesto para que no viera que tenía un tremendo rayón en pantalla y me di cuenta 2 semanas después que le dio curiosidad de por que con cristal ya puesto, eso me decepcionó vi otros detalles estéticos que pensé está bien por algo estaba barato no importa yo sabía que era con detalles por que esta especificado que no es nuevo de fábrica pero el hecho de ocultar un rayón no me pareció, todo lo demás excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en tiempo y forma, tenía muchas dudas respecto a la compra, el único pero que le pondría es la batería con un máximo de 82% de carga, fuera de eso todo perfecto con el producto, quedo satisfecho"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Item came well packaged and included a generic cable and charger. The case and screen were like new. Battery maximum capacity 85%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Actualización: decidí devolverlo porque tras 1 mes de uso, bajo 2% la condición de la batería y se calentaba mucho con los datos prendidos. Si no eres exigente es una muy buena opción…..Hasta ahora ha funcionado bien, llego con 89% de batería, tiene ligeros rayones en la pantalla pero son prácticamente imperceptibles. He notado que se caliente mucho la parte de atrás por debajo de la cámara cuando uso los datos móviles por un tiempo prolongado, si uso la cámara mucho tiempo y a veces cuando se esta cargando. Estética 9.5/10.Hare una actualización mas adelante sobre este calentamiento, si no me convence hare valida la garantía!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto me llegó muy bien y antes del tiempo indicado. Si quiero mencionar que al principio estuve a punto de devolver el celular porque trae algunos detalles de raspones en la pantalla, nada grave. Pero si me gustaría que Amazon tuviera un mejor estándar de valoración en sus productos, a pesar de que uno sabe de antemano que el producto es usado, pero aun así el precio es considerable. De manera general el celular me ha funcionado muy bien. La batería me llegó con 94% y el desempeño del celular es muy bueno. La solución que le di a los detalles fue comprar un protector de pantalla de cristal y se ve como nuevo! Gracias Amazon!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto! En excelente estado! Lo único que no se me hizo de buena calidad fue el cargador con el que viene. Pero de ahí todo súper bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular llego en excelente condiciones, venia en una cajita muy cool , al principio pensé que tenia unos rayones pero era cómo pegamento, después de limpiarlo quedó muy bien, podría decir que le doy un 10 de estética ya que de verdad no trae ningún golpe o rayón, la batería llego en 93% creo que igual está muy bien, además el precio en el que lo compré fue muy bueno ya que fue de oferta por el hot sale y ahora he visto que subió mucho, me quedo muy satisfecho con la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo viene sin detalles aparentes, la tapa trasera y bordes sin detalles, se ve perfecto!Venía con un cristal en pantalla que igual lo hace ver genial, sin embargo vi comentarios de que las utilizaban para disimular rayones, y en efecto, al removerla la pantalla tenía múltiples rayones pequeños y algunos más marcados. Con mica no se ven así que no tengo problemas.En cuanto al rendimiento, el porcentaje de vida de la batería es del 98 % bastante bien!Satisfecha con la compra, si hay algun cambio modificaré esta reseña."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto me gusto, llego en buen estado, ligeros detalles estéticos que se notan solo si lo miras muy a detalle, pila al 86%. Todo funciona excelentemente. Me gusto y el precio es bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batterie ne pas vraiment satisfaisant"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","al teléfono le cambiaron demasiadas piezas para mi opinión le cambiaron la pantalla la batería y la cámara la cámara quedo muy mal instalada cuando abro la cámara se traba demasiado y cuando muevo el celular con la cámara se mueve muy trabado y cuando tomo una foto se traba aun mas y cuando cambio el modo de foto se traba aun mas la verdad todo de la cámara esta horrible para el dinero que costo y el tipo de teléfono que es, también el touch aveces no detecta bien la verdad solo esas piezas logre saber que se cambiaron pero no se si le abran cambiado mas cosas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó en una cajita de plástico, el cargador obviamente es genérico (si fuera original sin duda se lleva un 10 de calificación) 512gb de almacenamiento, llegó con un 92% de batería, marcas mínimas de uso. El equipo muy bonito. Lo malo fue que lo pedí en verde media noche y llegó en color oro. Por el precio lo recomiendo y también por la fluidez, para el 2022 no le pide nada a los modelos actuales Android de media gama que rondan en precios similares. Sin duda una buena compra. Saludos desde la CDMX espero les sirva mi opinión. Si pueden adquirir el iPhone 11pro max lo recomiendo mas ya que trae batería y pantalla mas grande que el 11pro."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó sin rayones, como nuevo batería al 85% lo único malo es que cuando lo pongo a cargar se calienta muchísimo.Es rápido, le dura mucho la batería y la cámara está genial cambie mi 6s por este y la verdad si no se calentará le daría 5 estrellas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone llegó en excelente estado estética de 9.7 solo tiene unos pequeños puntos en la tapa de atrás que solo se distinguen a contra luz ( se han de ver hecho con la funda ) funciona de maravilla, la batería llegó al 93% y 4 meses después ya la tengo al 85% pero aún funciona bien en optimización.Lo recomiendo mucho, lo conseguí a 6 MSI y el costo fue de 14,500 el 11 pro de 256gbMuy conforme con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Decidí regresar el telefono porque traía rayones graves, sobre todo en la pantalla donde tratan de disimularlos con una mica de cristal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El artículo llegó en muy buen estado solo pocos rayones en pantalla pero en general bien lo único y creo para mí es lo más malo que el porcentaje de batería me llego con el 81% lo malo que dentro de poco tendré que cambiarla."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estética 8/10, algunos rayones en pantalla y marco de cámara, nada que se note demasiado ni que afecte el funcionamiento, con un case no se nota en absoluto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al pasar de unos meses comenzó a fallar la bocina y el reconocimiento facial; fuera de eso la estética es muy buena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Decepcionante: La bocina suena plasticosa, bajo y extraño, la pantalla no sé si sea percepción mía pero da tonalidades no tan fieles y la señal movil hay que alternar el modo avión para que quiera obedecer. Por otro lado rayones y batería al 87% que era algo a lo que estaba consciente previamente pero por lo anterior me decepcionó; el producto pudo ser bastante bueno en relación precio pero esos aspectos son clave, ni quise arriesgarlo a una gota de agua o caída después de ver esos detalles 😰. En espera del reembolso, veré si puedo reseñar diferente el artículo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo 3 semanas y hasta el día de hoy súper bien, estética 9.8 pero prácticamente como nuevo, único detalle a considerar batería en 87% de su capacidad. De repente las llamadas tardan en salir un poco, pero quiero pensar es mi compañía telefónica. Realmente sorprendió por el gran producto que recibí, sin duda muy recomendable. Espero todo siga como hasta hoy."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El dispositivo llego con una muy buena estética, algunos rayones en la pantalla pero solo se notan a contra luz, lo malo es que me llego con 86% de batería y a veces siento que dura muy poco, tal vez haga valida la garantía si es así editare la reseña con dicha experiencia."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","el producto me llego con rayones en la parte de las bocinas y de la cámara frontal, llevo 30 min intentando actualizar el celular y solo dice ""preparando actualización"""
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono por fuera está en impecables condiciones pero por dentro de batería está en 80% y las bocinas no se escuchan bien lo tengo que devolver"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto estaba increíble, no tenía rayones de consideración, la estética de 10. El problema fue la batería, llegó con un 75 % la descripción del producto indicaba que llegaba con 80 o más."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono está muy bien, solo que la batería me la dieron con 74% y tuve que ir a reemplazarla directamente a Apple."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo he utilizado 5 meses hasta ahora, en dos ocasiones las celdas de la batería se han descalibrado (se arregla descargando totalmente el equipo y volviéndolo a cargar) y pues fuera de eso funciona muy bien y estéticamente está como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iphone 11 pro adquirido llego sin contratiempos.En cuanto a la estetica del aparato tiene un 8/10, no tiene rayones o golpes. El bisel de acero no esta bien colocado y se obseva una separacion en la parte superior izquierda e inclusive se obsevan particulas de polvo. Trae una una mica de cristal en la pantalla y los complementos cable y cargador son genericos como lo indica amazon renewedEn cuanto a la funcionalidad del telefono:1. El telefono no vienen con una bateria original o genuina de apple y es lo primero que te indica el telefono, una vez que lo enciendes y comienzas la configuracion inicial. Dada la condicion de la bateria no es posible verificar el porcetanje que promete amazon renewed del al menos 80%. Con el primer dia de uso el telefono se calienta y la bateria se descarga rapidamente. El telefono se apaga repentinamente.2. El iphone 11 pro, llego con una version de software 14.4.1. Fue un calvario poderlo actualizar a la version 15.4.1 para poder migrar los datos de un viejo telefono a este que llego. No se puede actualizar el ios desde el mismo telefono, se tuvo que usar una macbook pro para hacer el proceso de actualizacion3. Tiene problemas para detectar algunos dispositivos bluetooth, se tiene que encender y apagar el bluetooth varias vecesConclusionesEl telefono no cumple con la promesa de ser un producto de calidad, inspeccionada y probada para trabajar de amazon renewed. Si luce como nuevo el telefono, pero el detalle de la bateria y el descuadre del bisel, evidencia que un deficiente control de calidad en los productos. ademas de no venderlo con almenos una version de ios 15. El vendedor de este telefono es BuySPRY, que tiene buenas calificaciones, motivo por eo cual me anime a hacer la compra, pero me llevo una total decepcionPor lo anterior mi calificacion es de una estrella y devolvere el producto solicitando el reembolso de lo pagado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","lo único que no me pareció es que lo abrieron y le cambiaron la pantalla por una generica, ademas el modulo de las cámaras tenía tornillos por dentro, pero ya quedo, lo demas muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Increíble llevo 3 meses con el equipo y no ha tenido ni una falla, la pila me llego con 99% y sin rayón alguno. Si duda alguna lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El hecho de que sea reacondicionado no quiere decir que se trate de un producto defectuoso, maltratado o disfuncional para nada está es la tercera vez que adquiero artículos reacondicionados a un mejor precio y realmente he quedado satisfecha hasta el momento, el teléfono llegó en muy buenas condiciones en un estuche de acrílico muy padre y sin ningún defecto, toma unas fotografías de lujo, aún me falta descubrir otras funciones pero hasta ahorita es recomendable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buena estetetica y funcionamiento parece nuevo estoi satisfecho"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Venia muy bien de estética pero al revisar la bateria estaba por debajo de 80% que es lo prometido, así que lo regrese"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Recibí un articulo con estética al 100, no fui capaz de encontrar ningún detalle, incluso llegó con una mica protectora instalada en la pantalla, cero rayones o golpes.En cuanto a la batería, ésta llegó al 94% y no he tenido un solo problema, carga sin problema y dura casi todo el día sin necesidad de recargar.Vino con accesorios genéricos el cable de calidad media (no sé si venga certificado, no lo use, yo uso un original de Apple) y el cargador de muy mala calidad, vino empacado en caja muy sencilla y el equipo bien protegido con plástico de burbujas.El equipo viene liberado e inmediatamente agarró señal de AT&T y Telcel.El número de serie empieza con F y según la información que uno encuentra en Internet esto significa que fue reconstruido por Apple o una empresa certificada por Apple para realizar procesos de reconstrucción.Pagué $16,300 pesos mexicanos por este equipo (menos de la mitad de lo que cuesta nuevo) y estoy satisfecho al 100%, recomiendo al vendedor y al equipo.Compré el equipo un Lunes por la tarde y lo recibí el Miércoles antes de medio día de esa misma semana."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","dejo de funcionar el touch a una semana que llego, como puedo ejecutar la garantia no encuentro un enlace"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto cumple oas expectativas muy bien cuidado estéticamente buena funcionalidad no doy las 5 estrellas ya que decía que tenia que llegar con 90% de batería y lo recibí con 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy satisfecho y sorprendido con la compra... hasta que le quite la mica con la que venía... ya que tiene la pantalla con 2 rayones importantes en la pantalla, que no se notaban por el glass que traíaLo recibí muy rápido, apenas al siguiente día de la compra.Tiene 1 rayón en una esquina, nada de escándalo y unos pequeños arañones en las cámaras.pero nada considerable... salvo eso, el teléfono podría pasar por impecableme llegó con el 88% de batería. Que eran cosas que tenía presupuestado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El dispositivo llego en perfecto estado, no cuenta con ningún golpe o rayon en la pantalla ni en la parte de atras, obtuve un dispositivo con el 100% de batería y estéticamente bien, ahora toca usarlo y ver que tal va en el dia a dia estoy satisfecho con la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buena opción! Está casi como nuevoMuy cuidado y es una buena forma de cuidar el planeta reutilizando. Por ahora me ha funcionado perfectamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This refurbished iPhone 11 Pro arrived quickly and in perfect cosmetic and working condition. I see no scratches, dents, or abrasions on the device AND it arrived with a screen protector pre-installed.On first use, the battery health of the phone was listed at 92%. There was a 5v charger and cable included, but it seems to charge pretty quickly. After several days of use, the device has no issues whatsoever that I can discern.The only minor issue was that the shipment was held up for a full week and I had some trouble getting a clear answer as to why on Amazon Chat - it ended up being a payment authorization issue. Once it cleared the phone arrived the following day (to an address in Quebec).Recommended !"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego en excelentes condiciones, 97% de batería, la capacidad 256 gb y la publicidad fue muy sincera al indicar que es de aparador o reconstruido. En mi caso llego con unos ligeros rayones en la pantalla pero nada que afecte o sea muy visible. En todo lo demás venía excelentemente cuidado, literal parecía nuevo.Me lo mandaron con un protector de pantalla ya puesto y hasta ahora ha respondido como uno nuevo en cuanto a su resistencia al agua.Estoy totalmente satisfecho con mi compra, me ahorre $$ al comprarlo así y el teléfono estaba prácticamente nuevo.En lo personal me quedo muy feliz después de este año de uso y me atrevo a decir un uso extremadamente excesivo, es mi herramienta principal del día a día y a pesar de eso no he tenido ni un solo problema con este teléfono."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buenas condiciones estéticas, si no te molesta que no venga en su caja original esta es una excelente opción!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en el tiempo indicado, prácticamente intacto, estética de 9.7 de 10, trae un par de marcas en el marco, pero nada realmente importante, la batería llegó con un 79%, aun así decidí conservarlo. Lo recomiendo ampliamente, la relación precio-calidad, excelente!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo en sí, tiene estética de 10, no tiene ningún rasguño y es muy elegante a la vista. Me vino con 83% de condición, pero siento que se calienta mucho. Además, el speaker de la parte superior se siente con volumen bajo. Por todo lo demás es un buen equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cumple con lo que ofrecen, cumple con mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","estoy muy contento y satisfecho con mi iphone 11 pro, tiene una serie de utilidades que no contaba con ellas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo regrese porque venía con muy poca batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Veía muchas reseñas un tanto 50/50, pero me quise esperar 1 mes usando el celular para dar reseña. Creo que ya es suerte el celular que te toque. A mí me fue muy bien en tanto a estética y uso: 10/10. Pero en batería me fue un poco normal, me llegó con condición de 82%, aun así me dura todo un día completo. La verdad yo si volvería a comprar otro acondicionado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone llego en buenas condiciones, estética de 10, batería al 100% pero al ponerle chip y realizar pruebas nos percatamos que casi no se escuchaba la Bocina del auricular, lo tuvimos que devolver, la devolución se realizó sin ningún problema y lo adquirimos con otro vendedor, este nuevo equipo llego con el 85% de batería pero hasta el momento funcionando correctamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The speaker on the screen came super dirty, yuck! Not even sure there’s a way to clean it? Battery life was 84%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono dice que la capacidad máxima es de 100% así que creo que está bien en ese aspecto pero vino de la cámara frontal súper rayado y de la parte de atrás justo en la manzana esta como despintado y muy polvoriento en el micrófono frontal, no me convence por eso."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en perfecto estado, batería al 98% lo único malo es que se calienta demasiado pero para el precio esta súper bien, yo lo recomendaría."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estaba temeroso en adquirir este producto pero a la hora de llegar lo recibí en perfectas condiciones, con el 89% de batería y sin ninguna marca visible, lo único que no me gusto fueron los accesorios con los que vinieron, el cubo no funcionaba y el cable estaba doblado, pero bueno era de esperarse, fuera de eso excelente producto.En 2 meses les confirmo mi experiencia."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Funciona bien, estetica bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No le pide nada a uno nuevo, llego impecable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo llego bien y la batería al 100, pero al mes y medio de uso me está fallando no se si la batería o el centro de carga, solito deja de cargar tengo que conectar y desconectar para que agarre"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al igual que muchas otras personas dude si el comprar un Reacondicionado era buena opción. La verdad es que estoy más que satisfecho con el producto, el teléfono está prácticamente nuevo, en cuanto estética solo pude encontrarle un detalle mínimo y cabe decir que soy muy especial con esos detalles pero no tiene absolutamente nada mal, ni un rayón a la pantalla ni ningún vicio oculto después de un mes de uso continuo el cual espere para hacer la reseña. La batería me llego con el 98% y se ha mantenido así, así que técnicamente recibí un teléfono nuevo a un excelente precio.Vendedor: Achemex"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tiene una bocina reventada :("
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo está en buen estado, solo no me convenció la vida de la batería que venía al 87% y una de la bocinas se escucha distorsionada. Solo por eso le doy 3 estrellas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía mis dudas al ser un producto re-acondicionado, me anime por la garantía de 90 días. El iPhone llego al día siguiente y en perfectas condiciones estéticas. Batería al 86%. Han pasado 3 días y funciona perfecto, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","shipping was taking sometime, here may be over a week, arrived in generic box with headphone only, the phone it self had noticeable scratches on screen, the body and the back looked like new, battery health was almost new, it was on discount and decided to keep it since I will put screen shield and those scratches will be invisible.keep in mind (Renewed doesn't mean phone will be flawless)it has been a month now and phone performing as expected.removed 2 starts for shipping delay and screen scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Beyond expectations! No signs of prior usage, battery health was at 100% (which was better than what I had started with on my previous iPhone from Apple). Packaging was great, came with a glass screen protector outfitted on the device. Runs smoothly, supports all my needs, basically everything I was looking for. My friends & family had doubts when they heard I was purchasing for a reseller, but the phone I received might as well be brand new. I specifically purchased from Amazon so I could get the 11 Pro which is no longer sold by Apple at this time but I’m thinking I will be a repeat customer when it comes time for a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto, el unico problema es que me llego rayado de la pantalla, lo demas bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Acabo de recibir el equipo y la verdad me gusto pero me desilusiona que no cumplan con lo que describen, me llegó con 78% de batería y sin llave para sacar el sim, veremos qué tal funciona, ya estaré modificando este comentario en el futuro.Ojo: si compras este producto o cualquier otro equipo restaurado, revísalo bien y que cumplan al 100% con lo que describen."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego bien solamente tiene manchas en la parte de atrás pero supongo que es por el uso de estética le doy un 8,5"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto en cuestión de estética llegó muy bien, nada de rayones ni golpes; sin embargo no cumple con la condición de batería. Traía una hoja de cumplimiento arriba de 90, pero el teléfono llegó con el 88% así que es lo único con lo que no cumplió."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me gustó el precio para ser de 256gb.La salud de la batería estaba en 90%Venía con una Mica de cristal incluida, no me gusta mucho tener el móvil con Mica de cristal y se la quité, me di cuenta de que la pantalla tenía demasiados rayones, muchos pequeños que solo se ven con luz y otros muy marcados.Eso no me gustó mucho y lo devolví"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone work very well, accept the battery life was very low 86%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A decir verdad el iPhone llegó en un excelente estado, venía súper cuidado y solo con algunos y muy ligeros rayones, la batería me sorprendió mucho ya que viene con 87%, todo funciona increíble bocinas, sensores etc etc, el cargador es uno genérico eso si pero en mi caso me llegó en un excelente estado !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I received the iPhone 11 Pro on April 1st, 2021, everything seemed fine! I am a boater and use my phone for navigation, I have been using iPhones for this for over 8 years with no issues. I also use various mapping apps for driving and general navigation. The iPhone 11 Pro I purchased nearly got me in serious trouble - the antenna on the phone was broken... meaning the GPS does not work outside of cell service (I live in a rural place so that is huge). These issues put me and my boat in major danger, the GPS kept telling me I was not where I was.I took the iPhone 11 Pro to the Apple store, after $56 they were able to tell me the phone antenna was broken and was sold broken to me. This was very disappointing and frankly dangerous. The Apple Store quoted me $880 to repair the antenna.The company was responsive but did not offer to pay for the repair or provide me with a replacement. I was offered a refund by Amazon. This is ok but i really just want a phone that works (as per their advertisement)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo ya una semana con el teléfono, es el primero de la marca que utilizo, no le pude encontrar ni un solo detalle más que la batería que venía al 91% (lo cual se me hace muy bueno por el precio que pagas) el teléfono está prácticamente nuevo y por la gran rebaja de precio que recibe me atrevo a decir que casi vale más la pena comprarlo remésese"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es una excelente opción el teléfono está certificado por Amazon y Apple, traía el 100% de batería y sin ningún detalle estético o en el funcionamiento del telefono"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego con rayones en las esquinas y la pantalla pero nada que afecte en cuanto a batería me llego con un 90 y con 5 cargas esta en 88 pero espero haya sido por las actualizaciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hasta el momento muy bien lo recomiendo me llegó estéticamente impecable y 92 de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La caja en donde viene no es la mejor, él teléfono viene con algunos rayones cómo se especifica pero funciona bien, aceptable."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pues solo el precio que se me dijo que valía 11 y fracción y al final fuero arriba de 13 y aún así decidí comprarlo mal sabor de boca pero estuvo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Overall the phone I received was fine. There were several cosmetic issues with the phone that I received.- There was a (albeit thin) 1.5 cm scratch on the screen, underneath the screen protector which was unfortunate- There were several fine scratches on the cameras on the back. Photo capability seems unchanged.- Battery health was pretty good at 95%The provided charger is unfortunately 5V/2.3a and therefore will not fast charge your phone. It would have been nice to see an 18 or 20 W charger included.Overall it’s fine for the price I paid."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Para haberlo comprado en $9,999 mxn creí que vendría con algo notorio, pero llegó súper bien, llevo 1 mes y no ha fallado de nada, tuve miedo al principio por ser Rea condicionado pero valió totalmente la pena!! Llegó con 83% de batería pero rinde muchísimo, muy bien!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad tenía miedo de comprar este tipo de artículos reacondicionados y pues como vi en muchos videos, esto es al azar. Puede llegar algo bueno o algo no tan bueno pero la garantía lo respalda.El mío afortunadamente llegó intacto a excepción de la pantalla un tanto rayada pero nada graveLa condición de batería al 98% y me ha funcionado perfectamente en estas semanas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estéticamente se merece un 10, me gustó mucho fue muy fácil de configurar, la batería venia con 93% de capacidad de uso, lo único que me comenzó a llamar la atención fue la pantalla, (estaba consciente al ser un producto “Renewed” podría tener detalles) la pantalla supongo fue remplazada pero su calidad era muy baja para mi vista fue un poco difícil y cansado, me gusto mucho la compra el tiempo de envío, volveré a intentar comprar un renewal pero ojalá que ya no venga con este detalle. Previamente tome el número de serie para cuando llegue el nuevo no tenga problemas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El sistema al manipularlo funciona normal, sin embargo el botón de encendido está un poco flojo, el marco del celular se ve de un material ajeno al del iPhone (se ve y se siente muy corriente).La batería es baja, si bien en todas la reseñas se menciona que llegan de 95%.En la pantalla hay una mancha que no es removible (se aprecia en la foto de la batería, está a la derecha de la última palabra “usarlo”)Los accesorios se ven de muy mala calidad también."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 La verdad es que el producto llegó mucho mejor de lo que esperaba, según las especificaciones que te indican de un producto reacondicionado. Por ejemplo, me llegó con un 95% de batería, lo cual esta muy bien, llevo aproximadamente 3 semanas usándolo y no me ha presentado ningún problema. Si llego con algunos ligeros detalles estéticos, pero claramente en la descripción dice que puede venir con ellos, además de que no van a ser percibidos a un brazo de distancia, lo cual en ml caso fue cierto, le agregue una mica de cristal y ya no se nota el rayón. Así que si, desde mi perspectiva todo bien, y de acuerdo a su descripción. Pd. Además es muy bonito 👀❣️"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego en excelentes condiciones y la vida de la batería en un 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono parece que funciona bien, tengo mis dudas respecto al uso en modo de datos. Fisicamente parecía estar bien hasta que le quité la mica, tenía la pantalla muy maltratada (con la mica no se logra ver) incluso hasta el ras de la cámara frontal tiene ligeros rayones, la batería testaba en un 83% en mi experiencia no volvería a comprar celulares renovados"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono me llegó muy rápido, no tiene ningún tipo de rayón visible a simple vista, la condición de la batería está al 85%.
Muy buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Una buena compra para el precio, está claro que es un producto reacondicionado. Hasta el momento ha resultado muy bien y está en buenas condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Vengo del iPhone X y este es tal cual se describe, viene con una leyenda en la pila que podría ser inferior, pero viene al 100%, al ser un producto refurbished es bastante bueno. No tuvo rayones ni nada raro. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al igual que todos tenía mis dudas pero valió la pena, el equipo llegó muy bien funciona perfecto salud de batería al 93% y en cuanto a estética no tiene ni un rasguño. Sin duda lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hasta ahora no puedo calificar la durabilidad porque me acaba de llegar (rea condicionado), pero me llegó en excelentes condiciones, si no fuera por la batería que tiene condición (85) podría pasar como producto “nuevo”. Me llegó sin ningún rasguño, perfectas condiciones estéticas y por lo que pagué estoy muy contento."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estoy muy complacido con mi producto. Me llego en excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me encanto el celular en general, no tiene ralladuras ni raspones, llego con 84% de batería, lo cual es aceptable para ser reacondicionado, el celular funciona excelente, como nuevo, las cámaras también, el único detalle es que tiene un poco despegada la pantalla en la parte de arriba, pero nada que realmente pueda afectarle al celular, venia envuelto en burbujas y con un cargador genérico."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó antes, no tenía ningún rayón y funciona a la perfección. La batería está prácticamente al 100% y traía cable original. Creo que tuve suerte porque se ve nuevo 🤩 ya tengo dos semanas con el y sin problemas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo bien y con la descripción sin embargo la bocina no se oye nada bien, está reventada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","De momento llevo una semana probándolo y todo correcto, desde la estética hasta el software, eso sí en cargador es genérico y no lo probé tenía originales."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Al principio tenía dudas acerca del teléfono porque había visto en varios post sobre que a veces llegaban fallados, con la batería muy desgastada o golpes. Pero en mi caso tuve suerte, el teléfono me llegó con 98% de batería y con dos pequeños arañazos en la pantalla que no afectan el funcionamiento del producto. El paquete llegó como indican en la descripción, una caja genérica y un cargador de dudosa calidad, pero funciona. Lo primero que hice después de configurarlo fue revisarlo con el programa 3utools para saber si alguna pieza había sido cambiada pero no, todo estaba como nuevo y me siento muy a gusto con mi compra y les quiero recordar algo que leí mucho “Es un volado” puede ser que te toque un equipo casi nuevo como el mío o que te toque uno con más tiempo de uso y/o imperfecciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad todo bien desde el precio pagado hasta la calidad del equipo, llego en perfectas condiciones. Ya llevo unos meses de uso y todo marcha bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Reacondicionado superó mis espectativas. El teléfono prácticamente está como nuevo. La batería me llegó con un 84% de vida útil. Estéticamente y en funcionamiento le daría un 10 de 10. Te lo envían con un cable certificado y un cargador certificado aunque ambos no sean originales. Yo soy de los que guardan la caja. Pero estos no vienen con una caja original sino genérica. Dicho eso estoy muy feliz con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estética de 9.5, batería en 96%, trae una mica de cristal frontal instalada, actualmente funciona sin ningún inconveniente, envío rápido.
Actualizare si tengo alguna falla.
De momento la mejor relación calidad y precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cumple con todas las expectativas, tenía mis dudas pero la verdad lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone was visibly damaged in multiple places out of the box. Disappointing."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó antes de lo planeado, en perfectas condiciones y sin detalles estéticos. Además viene con una mica de vidrio incluida."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Qué me gusto: llevo tiempo usándolo y hasta ahora el funcionamiento es súper óptimo. La batería tiene buen funcionamiento en comparación de otro nuevo que tengo.
Qué no me gustó: Sobre sale un poco la pantalla, pero es imperceptible en el uso, otro detalle es que en la información del teléfono indica que la batería no es un Producto original."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bonito y todo pero me llego de 89% de pila cuando la aplicación claramente dice mas de 90👎🏼"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono parece nuevo , muy a gusto con mi compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me acaba de llegar el iphone. Estéticamente está bien, el problema fue que al meterme a configuración para ver el estado de la batería me sale el mensaje de error de que la pieza no es original, está mal instalada o no funciona bien. Lo mismo con la pantalla.
Veo que a otros compradores sí les aparece el porcentaje de batería, por lo que no me quiero arriesgar y usarlo así sin los estándares de calidad que habían prometido al comprarlo.

Como no cumple con los estándares que promete el vendedor, estoy iniciando la devolución, es una pena porque realmente quería este celular."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llego con una estética de 9, por el precio fue una muy buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Phone is ok but the battery life is bad 80 percent life"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me animé a comprarlo después de ver varios videos de Amazon renovado y la verdad estoy muy contento en mi primer día, todo funciona la estética es impecable y el porcentaje de batería viene arriba de 90, los accesorios no son problema porque especifica que no son originales pero funcionan a la perfección, seria cosa de ver como me sigue funcionando en 1 semana 1 mes etc"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo tiene estética de 9.5, solo que el equipo que ha mi me toco traía la batería de 80% lo cual ya era problema de uso para lo que se ocupaba, al igual que tenia sobre calentamiento al realizar alguna actividad (juegos en especifico)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","when i got it there was two little scratches on the screen (which is weird considering that the phone is supposed to be renewed) but besides that the phone works like a charm"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Quedé realmente sorprendido!! :D El teléfono llegó con 91% en la condición de la batería y con una mica ya instalada, no tiene ni un solo rayón, ni un solo golpe. Funciona todo perfecto, hasta ahora no ha fallado nada, no se calienta ni nada. Sólo tiene 2 ligeros ""raspones"" en los bordes, que sólo alcancé a ver con el Flash de mi otro iPhone, a simple vista está completamente perfecto! Estoy casi completamente seguro que soy primer dueño de este iPhone!! Recomiendo ampliamente al vendedor BuySPRY por entregar productos en PERFECTO estado! Sin duda le volveré a comprar!! :D:D"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En realidad tenía miedo acerca de cómo iba a llegar el producto ya que el precio me pareció bastante atractivo, tengo que decir que estoy completamente sorprendida ya que el equipo llego sin un solo rasguño, estetica completamente al 100%, la caja si era genérica y el cargador también pero completamente funcionales y correos den a lo pagado por el equipo, definitivamente lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego a tiempo ala fecha establecida, el detalle es que la pantalla si vienen algo dañado, pero en funcionamiento perfectamente la batería igual 85% pero es Reacondiconado no puede uno exigir mucho igual por el precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Aunque llegó con poca pila, fue a mi apple más cercana a aplicar el seguro.
No me cobraron nada y ahora tengo un 11 pro nuevo!
Es cuestión de suerte pero por 11,099.00 nada mal. Pienso que es una gran opción es siempre y cuando no sea muy necesario y urgente el teléfono, ya que sino te gusta lo puedes devolver. En mi caso lo compré por un cupon de 999.00 que me regalo amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone solo llegaba al 80% porciento de batería y se calentaba mucho al grabar o tomar fotos, se descargaba muy rápido creo no me tocó buena suerte."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad el telefono ha estado funcionando muy bien, estoy a punto de cumplir 3 meses con el. Llego con 100% de condicion de bateria, pero hasta ahora ha bajado al 94% no he tenido Iphone anteriormente si que no se muy bien que tan preocupante podria ser. Detalles en los lados de uso, pero pantalla y parte posterior al 10000%

El único detalle, que ha tenido es que el cargador dejo de funcionar a los dos meses. Así que tengan en consideración comprar uno de la marca. De ahi en fuera, no vino con caja ni cargador original, ni mica como muchos decian, pero eso ultimo es lo de menos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo venía sin ningún daño, solo podría decir que el detalle que encontré fue que la batería es del 82% entiendo que mencionan que es mínimo de 80%, pero en funcionalidad se encuentra al 100, volvería a comprar sin problema “."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en el tiempo indicado, no tiene detalles , muy buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en excelentes condiciones, mas de lo que esperaba."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó con unos pequeños rayones en la pantalla que son casi imperceptibles a la vista, aceptable para ser un equipo re acondicionado, eso si, no tiene golpes en la carcasa y llegó con un rendimiento del 90% de batería, la cual dura bastante, estoy conforme con la compra, lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Compre renovado Premium que envía Amazon Estados Unidos, funciona con chip de Telcel, me vino con la autonomía de la batería al 100%, excelente opción."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This phone is amazing and super easy to set up. Was worried buying used with some of the reviews but it was 100% worth it! Came with a scratch on the metal but it’s so tiny and you can’t see it when you put the phone in a case."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy mal desempeño, pesima inversion para el resultado..."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo un mes con el celular y la verdad si estoy sorprendida del funcionamiento ya que no he batallado con el, el empaque es genérico pero es muy bueno, detalles estéticos 9.8/10, hasta ahorita todo va bien, espero seguir así, batería del 94%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Telefono llego en excelente estado, buena relacion calidad-precio, llego con cargador y cable (generico, no original) , lo cual se agradece. Buena compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No me gusto el estado de la bateria,me llego un equipo con 87 de bateria, lo utilice por una semana pero el equipo se calentaba y ademas el parlante estaba descompuesto, lo compare con otro iphone 11 y funcionaba genial a comparacion de este, tal vez solo tuve mala suerte ya que en un principio habia escuchado buenas reseñas de los equipos y por eso me anime a comprarlo, pero como repito tuve mala suerte con este celular.
Tambien tenia una astilladura en el marco de la camara, no me importo mucho realemente pero me decepciono con el parlante."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I am extremely satisfied with my purchase! There is no visible damage to the phone whatsoever, the battery health is at 100%, and the order arrived earlier than it was supposed to! My main concern was the phone would have a poor battery health percentage, however I turned out to be wrong. Plus, they generously included a screen protector already installed! I had no problem setting it up, and the phone is in great physical condition! Amazing, and great value for the money you pay!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La relación producto - precio es excelente
El producto está en perfecto estado y también incluye cargador y cable nuevos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente equipo en relación precio / calidad , lo recomendó . Batería 100 % , estética le doy un 92% traen unos rayones en las orillas pero con un case no se ve . Trae mica de pantalla y accesorios Cable/cubo genérico ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Iphone entregado antes de la fecha pactada, excelente estado, unos pequeños rayones a un costado pero ni se nota a simple vista, con 94 de condicion de bateria, espero asi continue, en unas semanas comento como le fue pero al momento de manera excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo excelente, teléfono es perfectas condiciones y muy bien empaquetado, muy buena experiencia ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estéticamente el celular estaba prácticamente impecable, no obstante tuve que devolverlo, pensé que llegaría con un 90% de salud de batería mínimo, pero llego con 82% por lo cual se iba a empezar a poner problemático en menos de 18 meses y mínimo ese tiempo es el que pensaba usarlo, hay que considerar que cambiarles la batería a cualquier iPhone es costoso y riesgoso, por esa razón tuve que devolverlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","el Iphone venia tal cual como lo describe buena compra para el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego muy rapido el iphone esta muy bien pero el precio estuvo excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo excelente, como nuevo , único detalle que no le pongo 5 estrellas es la condición de la batería esta a al 80%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Le doy una calificación de 7 de 10, presenta algunos rayones en pantalla, los bordes y en una de las camaras traseras. No afecta al funcionamiento pero si se nota que es usado.
Tardó mucho en cargar al principio y se calentó, probablemente debe ser por el cargador genérico, ya lo cambie y espero que no me de problemas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Más que satisfecho con la compra. Es la primera vez que compro un producto reacondicionado y superó mis expectativas. La batería tenía 94% de estado, dura todo el día. La pantalla con ligeros rayones y la bocina se escucha muy poco, pero fuera de eso todo bien. Lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La atención al cliente es de lo mejor, el producto que yo recibí estaba en perfectas condiciones con una batería del 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La cámara genérica, fatal."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente equipo llegó prácticamente nuevo sin ningún detalle, todo al 100 estética 10/10 capacidad de batería al 100.
Ya un mes de uso y todo super bien con el equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buenos dias a todos, realice esta compra alrededor de 2 semanas y la verdad solamente no doy las 5 estrellas porque la bateria venia con un 81% de vida, uno esta consiciente desde que lee la descripcion, pero, no estaria mal que vinieran TODOS con un +90% para ser un celular de 14 mil pesos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego en excelentes condiciones sin un rasguño y funcionando perfecto, excelente compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente teléfono estética de 10
Porcentaje de la pila 88%
Ninguna falla si vuelvo a comprar otro mas
Teniendo en cuenta que este es el 2 iPhone renovado y me an venido de maravilla."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El precio fue totalmente El adecuado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A pesar de que no es último modelo de iPhone, la verdad es que llegó en perfecto estado, estética de 9.5 y la batería me llego con la capacidad del 100%
Una compra bastante buena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nunca había comprado un reacondicionado, sin embargo estoy muy satisfecho, el producto llego con una estética de 10, sin golpes y la pantalla sin rayones ni nada por el estilo. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó un iPhone 11 Pro con el 99% de batería, impecable. Prácticamente nuevo. ¡Quedé muy sorprendido por la calidad del equipo!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono esta muy bien, estéticamente ningún detalle y trabaja al 100, la batería esta al 86% de su salud, lo cual es muy bueno para un teléfono que salió en 2019"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en una caja muy mala y el cargador NO original, pero el celular llego al 100, la condición de batería me llego al 84%, 100% original el producto, muy cuidado y me llego en 4 días"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Batería estaba al 97% y la estética es de 10, sin ningún detalle exterior. Además tiene una mica en la pantalla.Me llevo una muy grata sorpresa con los Amazon Renewed. Aunque venga con accesorios genéricos, es un gran producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente servicio... Me llego el equipo como nuevo y con un protector de pantalla de regalo.-Estética 9/10.-Batería al 90% da muy buen rendimiento.-Envío en tiempo y forma. El equipo llego bien embalado y sin ningún detalle.-Incluye cargador (carga rápida) y cable genéricos, pero funcionales.Comprar un equipo reacondicionado es un gamble, pero este proveedor cumplió con lo que prometió. (Sin mencionar que te ofrece una garantía de 30 días)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hasta ahorita se me ha trabado pocoLlego con 93% de batería, así que creo que es un poco alto el costo con relación a la calidad, espero no me falle en el futuro"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Not only what I expected but better. Not at arm’s length but close up perfect, and battery well over 80%, in fact I think 93% at least.Seller even got back to me to see if I was happy and anything they could do to help.Impressed!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sencillamente, fue un móvil nuevo el que me enviaron. No hay defecto en lo que adquirí"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone de lejos no se ve mal, sin embargo tiene detalles como la parte del cromado que parece que lo haya pintado con esmalte de uñas. Tenía esperanza por las opiniones que había en el artículo pero para mi gusto no vale la pena el precio, prefiero devolverlo por uno nuevo. La batería vino en 84% y tiene un rayón en la pantalla pero como le ponen un protector de pantalla para que no se vea. Si no les molesta la estética está bien por el precio. Su funcionalidad es de 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone llegó en perfectas condiciones físicas! 10/10Lo he traído en uso intensivo para verificar rendimiento de la pila, pantalla, bocinas, Bluetooth, cámaras, etc. Y pues hasta el día en que estoy feliz con mi teléfono. Una excelente compra la mía."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía un poco de dudas, pero la verdad el teléfono que recibí está en perfectas condiciones, ningún rasguño en la pantalla, solo un pequeño raspón atrás (que con carcasa queda completamente desaparecido) micrófono, bocinas, sensibilidad, cámara, todo al 100. La batería está en 85 de vida, pero rinde al máximo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego mucho mejor de como me lo imaginaba, excelente compra hice 100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","ninguna queja, es una chulada de teléfono y lo agarré a buen precio, traía estética de 10 y batería al 88%, definitivamente volvería a comprar"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo estuvo en perfectas condiciones, la batería estaba al 99%... Encantados con el producto por el precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 El iPhone esta impecable no tiene rayones ni abolladuras, el tema es el audio, la bocina superior esta dañada, cuando haces llamadas no se les entiende bien a las personas, y si lo pones en reproducción de musica se oye como estéreo viejo, solo sirve la bocina inferior, y la batería me vino al ras de lo prometido 81%"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone funciona muy bien, me llegó con un 86% de batería, hubiera esperado que fuera más pero lo que no me gustó es que viene con un rayón muy profundo, digo ya prendido el iPhone no afecta la visibilidad, pero si le pasas el dedo si se siente el rayón, y no, no está sobre la mica, le quité la mica pensando que estaba en la mica, y me di cuenta que estaba sobre el cristal.
Fuera de eso funciona bien y no tiene ningún otro golpe o Rayón sobre la carcasa."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía muchas dudas, pero valió la pena. Estética de 10 y funciona perfectamente. La batería me llegó al 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Ha sido un buen producto, por calidad-precio hasta el momento muy bien, yo lo compré hace 5 meses y los únicos detalles son que la pantalla a veces falla el touch y que la batería no dura mucho."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No duden en comprarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No le pongo 4 estrellas solamente porque pudieran mejorar la calidad el cargador con el que viene, por lo demás, tanto calidad, envoltura, funcionamiento y estética del equipo es un 10 de 10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Equipo en super buen estado sin ralladuras ni nada por el estilo estética de 100 lo super recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","De momento parece como nuevo, ya revise audio, wifi, bluetooth, tarjeta del chip sin problemas, batería con 93% de vida, a ver como funciona estos días."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estéticamente había llegado con algunos golpes en el marco y rayones en la pantalla que se notaban aun con el protector que le ponen y la bocina de arriba sonaba (en un principio) algo baja, normal si consideras que es mas pequeña. hasta ese punto son temas que al ser Renewed pueden ser comprensibles.

Pero conforme fui usando el equipo los videos se grababan con un volumen bajo como si estuvieran muy lejos, pero a los 20 o 30 segundos sonaba con volumen normal , en las llamadas en ocasiones sonaba como si estuviera muy lejos la otra persona y a veces ni siquiera se escuchaba a los 3 o 4 días ya comenzó a sonar la bocina superior como si estuviera rota (como si pusieras un cartón enfrente ).

decidí regresarlo ya que justamente para lo que ocupo no lo iba a poder utilizar, la estética era lo de menos en ese punto pero no lo iba a poder utilizar de manera correcta"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto llegó muy bien
De estática ningún detalle, cámaras, FaceID, bocinas funcionando bien
Llegó con mica
Pero al quitársela me percaté que la pantalla estaba rayada, no interfiere con la visualización de contenido y no se aprecia al ponerle mica, pero si es considerable el daño en la pantalla
Llegó con una batería de 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es la primera vez que compro un equipo renovado y pensaría que estuviera en mejores condiciones estéticas, en particular el equipo que me llegó tenía ralladuras en todo el marco muy notorias. adicional a ello en la parte de la pantalla me llego con una mica de cristal queriendo enmascarar las ralladuras, algunas de ellas eran muy profundas y se notaban demasiado.
Por otro lado me llego un modelo que se vende en US y el cual no funciona del todo bien con la red de MX o al menos no es compatible con la red compartida en la que tengo mi plan.
Fuera de lo anterior el equipo funcionaba bien y la vida de la batería era de 92% pero mi decisión fue regresarlo ya que no cumplía con mis expectativas y tampoco me era del todo funcional."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó con 94% de batería. Trae un ligero raspón por la bocina en la parte de abajo, realmente no se notan. El cargador que trae, es de buena calidad. Muy contenta con la compra :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The out of box experience isn’t great, but it’s 60% of the cost of new. Two days in, battery life is 100%, minor blemishes from what seems like a battery replacement but nothing very noticeable. Looks pretty much new, hardware works great, software works like new. Will update if there are any issues in the coming weeks."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono funcionaba bien y de estética estaba bien, no me gustó porque tenía muchos rayones profundos en la pantalla y la batería era del 86%, por lo que mejor decidí devolverlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó un día antes de lo indicado
El teléfono viene intacto, sin ningún rasguño y con condición de batería de 96%

Ampliamente recomendable 💯"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto y el precio están muy accesible súper recomendable!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía mis dudas pero la verdad llego súper rápido y en buen estado, la batería llegó con un 91% que consideró bien, el celular llegó con mica de protección y sin ningún rayón casi como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo ya con el 5 meses y todo bien hasta ahora. Solo llego con un rasguño en la pantalla casi imperceptible. No trae cargador ni cubo original y viene en una caja equis."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estética del equipo de 9.9. Trae protector en cristal delantero y trasero. El motivo de cambio de mi equipo anterior fue por la bateria. El unico “inconveniente” de este iphone es que la capacidad máxima de bateria fue del 87%. Si me hubiera tocado uno con 95% habria sido perfecta la compra. NO me arrepiento."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Debo de reconocer que al principio tenía mis dudas de comprar un equipo semi nuevo y más por internet. Que llegará un libro, un Boing, etc. O que llegara súper maltratado. Sin embargo, quede muy satisfecho con la compra del equipo.
El equipo llegó el día estipulado
El equipo físicamente es de 10
La batería tiene el 91%
Bocina, cámaras, Face ID, centro de carga y botones funcionando al 100%
No se si fue cuestión de suerte o todos sus equipos que maneja este proveedor estar impecables. Sin duda alguna volvería a adquirir algún otro equipo con ellos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Funciona muy bien todo, pila 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Like its good though but dislikes no earphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular viene en buenas condiciones, sin embargo, tiene un uso de batería del 84% lo cual me parece muy bajo y el audífono se escucha distorsionado al reproducir audio o llamadas en altavoz. En una llamada con el celular pegado a la oreja se escucha bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular llegó en muy buen estado. Sin embargo, después de 4 meses de uso empezó a reiniciarse y a no reconocer la batería. En cuanto lo llevé me dijeron que la batería estaba en perfecto estado, pero que tenía un error en la placa base del celular que arrojaba el siguiente log ""panic full"", que me explicaron, es un error que con el tiempo no va a volver a prender el celular. Hasta el momento se me sigue reiniciando después de 2 horas de uso y en loops de reinicio de hasta 6 horas!!!!!!!

Chequen sus productos antes de que la garantía de amazon se termine"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Received at the end of estimate delivery time. The phone itself is very good. No scratch or any obvious sign of wear. Comes with 5W apple charger. The phone has 92% battery health."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía mis dudas al ser reacondicionado… pero me ha servido muy bien… y no ha presentado falla alguna"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Recibi el producto antes del tiempo señalado. vino como nuevo, bateria al 95 %, sin rayaduras. llevo dos meses con el y hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me decidí por este tipo de artículo reconstruidos por su precio, que no se compara con uno nuevo. Este en particular llegó bien con lo descrito en la publicación, a pesar que tiene un pequeñísimo detalle en carátula no tiene nada que ver con su funcionamiento. Todo lo demás bien, la batería tiene mas del 80 % de capacidad y la marca te respalda su funcionamiento. Lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The phone came with a screen protector! That was great to see

But the battery is not good and there's already glitches sometimes like I have to close apps sometimes or the screen freezes

Plus it easily gets hot"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo llego en excelente estado sin problema alguno, y todo funciona a la perfección."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me está gustando el iPhone porque me llego muy rápido y apenas tiene un rayón diminuto, la salud de la batería la tiene al 100% y por el momento el celular está trabajando bien y sin problemas, actualizo si llego a tener fallas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fue la primera vez que adquiría un celular a través de Amazon Renewed y no me arrepiento. El celular llego en buenas condiciones, prácticamente como nuevo. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cumple lo que menciona ya que vino al siguiente día de haberlo comprado; después de revisarle todo vino prácticamente como un iPhone nuevo con la batería al 100%. Solamente vino con una pequeña raya ocasionada en el notch pero que no impedía las operaciones del celular y estéticamente casi no se nota."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iPhone arrived in very poor condition and not as described. It had a screen protector loosely and crookedly installed, and the screen underneath had heaps of scratches - all very noticeable at arms length, despite the claim in the item description. Sides were also scuffed and camera lenses had scratches around the rim. Battery health was also abysmal at 83%, above 80 as described but nowhere near the 90+ in other reviews. Immediately returning this. Just buy from apple and save yourself the trouble. Never buying Amazon Renewed again. Very dissapointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad, tenía mis dudas por tratarse de un equipo “renewed”, sin embargo todo resultó excelente, recibí un teléfono por debajo del costo promedio y en perfectas condiciones, ni un rasguño y estética de 100. La funcionalidad, perfecta, como si viniera de Apple. Felicidades a Amazon por ofrecer estos productos que de otra manera sería más difícil tener acceso a ellos. Esta compra es garantía de servicio y calidad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en muy buenas condiciones, la batería al 86, estéticamente 9.5, funcionalidad 10, sobre los accesorios (cable y cargador) incluye lo que indica en la descripción, son genéricos. Definitivamente volvería a comprar uno restaurado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estética de 10"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Equipo con la calidad de uno nuevo, la calidad-precio es lo mejor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hola buenas noches adquirir un iPhone 11 pro pero ya le puse un chip att& y me aparece error en llamada me podrían ayudar"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No funciona la
Pantalla correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","3 meses con el y funciona perfectamente. Un poco ya desgastada la pila pero no me genera problemas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La batería tiene un estado de 99%, estéticamente se ve al 98% solamente tiene detalles de uso en las esquinas de lado derecho, no esperaba tanto de un producto reacondicionado, solo llevo 1 semana con el celular, a ver qué tal va después"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El envío fue muy rápido, el equipo esta en terminos generales, bien, algunos rayones pero nada excesivo y opera muy bien; recomiendo al vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","el equipo en perfectas condiciones todo trabaja correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llego en perfectas condiciones, con la batería al 100% y sin un rasguño, parecía nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En relación al precio está bien el equipo, sólo tiene unas pequeñas raspaduras en los laterales de la pantalla, lo que no me gusta nada es que se calienta demasiado el equipo, pero en si, se podría decir que está bien el equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono funciona a la perfección, pero este venía con la pantalla rayada y no me percate de esto al principio porque tenia una mica puesta, al parecer le pusieron esa mica para que no se notará. De haberme dado cuenta antes lo hubiera regresado. Revisen muy bien los teléfonos que compren con este vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","BUENA PRESENTACION YFUNCIONAMIENTO"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Se ve y funciona perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pues el equipo me llegó rápido, solo que venia muy desgastado de la pila y la pantalla con muchos rayones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó en las condiciones que se especifican en la descripción. La batería llegó con una vida del 97%, aunque tras no muchas semanas de uno bajó a 94%. Fuera de eso, el teléfono funciona de manera perfecta. Las cámaras no tienen ningún problema y estéticamente el teléfono está integro. Como el teléfono era importado desde Estados Unidos, salió un poco más caro y fue un poco más tardado que si lo hubiera comprado en México, sin embargo, personalmente esto me dio un poco más de confianza."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente estado ningún rasguño todo bien batería supongo calibrada como sea dura todo el día súper recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto llegó con una mica y se veían rayas en la pantalla, intente cambiar la mica para solucionar el fallo y es la pantalla la que está rayada, no son ligeros rasguños. Amazon no debe poner que son Certificados por Amazon si no verifican la calidad ofertada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","ES UN CELULAR TOTALMENTE NUEVO, NO PRESENTÓ ALGÚN GOLPE O DETALLE , SOLO QUE NO VIENE EN CAJA ORIGINAL Y EL CARGADOR ES GENÉRICO, PERO SI CUMPLE CON UN BUEN FUNCIONAMIENTO"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto sin defecto alguno si lo revisas a detalle notas líneas casi nulas en pantalla, no me gusta los cargadores q no sean originales ni que no traiga lo AirPod como cable, ni caja original pero se entiende. La verdad si recomiendo un renovado y lo mejor llego dos dias antes de lo establecido"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone está en excelente estado, casi como si fuera nuevo, ¿lo malo? Como bien dice la publicación no tiene audífonos, el problema es que viene en una caja genérica con cargador y cable también genérico de calidad media-Baja realmente lo que compras es únicamente el smarthphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto es justo lo que ofrecen, funciona con Telcel y at&t, no tuve problemas para actualizar y poner mi iCloud.Viene en caja genérica, con accesorios genéricos,"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me gustó el producto en general solo que es algo pequeño. Pero es una excelente compra"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","He recibido el móvil y llego en perfecto estado! No fui capaz de encontrarle algún rasguño siquiera, todo luce muy bien! La batería parece estar al 95% y venia con un protector de pantalla ya instalado, espero que todo siga así... si no es porque lo enviaron en una caja ordinaria, cualquiera pensaría que recibió un iPhone nuevo

Actualización: Llevo con mi celular desde diciembre 2020, la batería ha disminuido su capacidad hasta un 93% pero lleva así ya varios meses, nada ha fallado en el aparato y no me arrepiento de haberlo comprado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es mi primer iPhone y estaba nervioso (como muchos de ustedes que leen esto) y no sabía si era seguro, me animé porque después de todo Amazon enviaba la compra, me llegó en un día y en la caja que se muestra en la foto, que la verdad no está nada mal. El celular venía impecable y con un estado de batería al 99%, sin rasguños en la parte trasera (en la delantera no parce tener nada, ya viene una mica por lo que se agradece)

En fin, si quieren probar iPhone y casi a mitad de precio, es una buena opción. :D"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es una gran compra, el teléfono me llegó con un 90% de batería y sigue igual. Estéticamente está 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","me llego con una bateria con 87% de desgaste pero después de 2 semanas lo devolví por que en solo 2 semanas bajo hasta 84 estéticamente estaba perfecto y en cuanto a funcionamiento también, si no hubiera sido por la bateria le daba un 10 de 10"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I don’t like the phone. All the edges were badly scratched. Body was totally damaged and I returned it and bought the same on apple store with less price"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen equipo, con buena estética, el problema fue la distorcion de la bocina, ni modo lo tendré que devolver"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This case fits the phone but with three cards it won’t close properly."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La cámara no enfoca y cuando trata de enfocar hace ruidos extraños. Cómo hago para que me lo cambien?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Funciona sin fall"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","EL TELEFONO LLEGÓ SIN DETALLES ESTÉTICOS PERO AL USARLO Y CONECTARLO A UNA BOCINA MEDIANTE BLUETOOTH, EL IPHONE SE CALIENTA MUCHO, ASÍ MISMO CUANDO HABLAS POR TELÉFONO. LA BATERIA SE ACABA SUPER RÁPIDO, TENIENDO AL MEDIO DIA 30% Y CON UN USO MODERADO DESDE LAS 8 AM."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El artículo supone ser de uso pero realmente venía sin ningún rayón, la pantalla funciona perfecto, tiene el 90% de batería así podemos decir que es casi nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en tiempo, tiene detalles superficiales en la pantalla como pequeños rayones, pero lo que más importaba era la vida útil de la batería, llegó con 73% por lo que se tuvo que regresar."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó bien embalado, en buen estado estético, sólo la batería llegó en un 86% de vida útil, pero no me quejo, por el precio es muy buena compra y el teñéfono aún aguantará por lo menos un año antes de reemplazar la batería."

Unico detalle no viene con accesorios orginales (no incluye earpods) y en este caso no es cargador de carga rapida."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Dudaba de la seguridad de la compra, sin embargo el celular llego en tiempo y forma, el estado del equipo es como si fuera nuevo. Realmente estoy sorprendido, llego con un cargador genérico y una mica incluida, el estado de la bateria no es el mejor pero sin duda es lo que esperas por el precio, sin duda alguna fue una buena compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Después de 7 meses de quitarle el cristal que tenía en la pantalla me doy cuenta de unos rayones. Cuidado con eso, si les llega con cristal quítenlo y revisen. De funcionamiento está al 100, si lo compraría de nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo físicamente estaba en buenas condiciones salvo un ligero raspón que tenía en el marco superior, lo malo fue que tenía la bocina inferior reventada y la batería en muy baja condición de pila. Todo lo demás bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The iphone was good was good but would not work on Canadian Telecoms. I returned it."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No funciona correctamente, El conector no sirve y no lo puedo cargar. He enviado un correo al proveedor para solicitar el reemplazo o devolución y nadie me responde.
Los 90 días de garantía que ofrece el proveedor al parecer es una mentira.
Los 30 días que ofrece Amazon ya pasaron y no lo puedo regresar con ellos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Teléfono en excelentes condiciones. El funcionamiento no tiene queja alguna"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El telefono hasta el momento llego bien,llego a los 2 dias de que lo pedí, llego con un 90% de visual, la pantalla un poco con rayaduras, pero son minimas, muy buena bateria. Hasta el momento todo bien 👍🏽"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo llego en excelentes condiciones ni un solo detalle y la salud de la bateria al 100 sin duda no me arrepiento de confiar en amazon renewed premium."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo genial esta nuevo literalmente me llego con 98% de batería y supero mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente artículo, era de esperarse que vendría con detalles y si, el detalle fue un pequeño rasguño en el borde, pero la batería al 100% y cero fallos, lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","De estética le doy un 9.5 por que la pantalla venia con un ligero rayón pero de ahí en fuera todo correcto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es bastante útil, casi como nuevo, solo se apaga la pantalla muy de vez en cuando pero prende el sistema en segundos (supongo que por eso lo regresaron) relación precio calidad bastante Bueno! Volvería a comprar uno así"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No fue lo que esperaba, llegó incompleto sin cable ni cargador 😞"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en el día indicado.
Físicamente. El teléfono llegó muy bien empacado, venía con un cargador y cable genérico pero con certificado de calidad, y estéticamente al 100%, también traía su mica de cristal.
Funcionalidad. Hasta ahora toda va excelente, la batería con 100% de desempeño y para el uso que yo le doy me dura dos días completos, literas dos días con sus dos noches, así que si lo recomiendo. Gracias!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo funciona bien, es un excelente producto debido a la calidad y al precio, llego con 100% de salud de batería y no me ha dado ninguna falla, recomendado!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estoy muy decepcionado de la compra, el equipo presenta rayones profundos en la pantalla, la bocina frontal está sucia y no funciona correctamente, no volvería a comprar renewed con los criterios que maneja Amazon mexico"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto, funciona como si fuera nuevo, la pantalla tiene el true tone y verificando con el 3utools no le han reemplazado piezas, por eso la batería al 84% que aún así me dura todo el día sin problemas, no se calienta y corre super bien todas las aplicaciones, el único detalle es un rasguño en la pantalla pero es imperceptible"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó
Como nuevo sin detalles de uso y sin ningún rasguño, lo único malo fueron la caja y los accesorios no originales, es una muy buena compra por el precio y vale la pena"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo iba bien. A los 4 meses dejo de funcionar: se apagó de la nada y nunca volvió a prender. Nunca más comprare los reacondicionados de Amazon. A ese precio me sale más barato un nuevo que me durará unos años y no unos meses."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Está es una de las mejores compras que he hecho, el celular está prácticamente nuevo, no tiene ningún detalle físico y aún cuenta con su Mica y tiene el 100% de batería, sin bien como de menciona los accesorios son genéricos al igual que la caja para mí no fue inconveniente, el precio está por menos de la mitad que uno nuevo, asi que si tienes la oportunidad y el dinero es una muy buena opción."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Note que el celular se encontraba algo sucio, al principio pensé que eran rayones pero tras limpiarlo quedó muy bien.

Solamente unos rayones muy pequeños en la pantalla,mínimos.

Batería con el 98% de vida útil y cargador y cable de corriente genéricos como indicado

Pequeños detalles que hacen que la primera impresión al abrirlo no sea tan placentera, más aún entiendo que no es un equipo %100 nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto como nuevo, ya tengo desde marzo usándolo y no me a fallado ni un poco, todo perfecto el cargador genérico que incluye esta excelente carga súper rápido al 100 mi equipo. Ni un solo rasguño equipo impecable. A pesar de ser re acondicionado funciona perfectamente. Ya había comprado uno desde diciembre 2020 y aún sigue funcionando perfectamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Por el precio era de esperarse que el producto viniera con detalles, la pantalla viene intacta, la batería al 93%, y si tiene detalles estéticos que son de esperarse."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo en buenas condiciones en general, solo con algunos marcas o rayaduras en la pantalla, no entregan accesorios originales, el cargador no cumplía con el Voltios y Amperes que un cargador original requiere."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono tiene daño visible no lo he usado esperaría que funcione bien. Estéticamente le doy 5 no es posible que no lo envíen ni con cargador."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Debo aceptar que compré con miedo el cel. Pero después de ver videos y reseñas me animé y debo confesar que es una de las mejores compras que he realizado. Funciona a la perfección, sólo tenía un par de raspones mínimos qué ni se notan. Por el precio 100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Does not come in original Apple iPhone casing but it works and looks like brand new.No scratches, battery life is good.Overall recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Funciono bien el primer mes, al momento me está causando problemas con el touch, no cierra aplicaciones, no me deja bajar y subir brillo y volumen, la condición de la batería bajo 5% en cuestión de 1 mes de uso, me gustaría saber que aplica en este caso. Saludos."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No me gusto, porque estéticamente se veía muy deteriorado respecto al precio aparte de la vida de la batería muy degradada en 80%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La bateria esta en perfecto estado, y en general ni siquiera parece renovado esta como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estoy fascinada con el súper buena compra la condición de la batería venía en 94% lo cual me parece excelente, solo tuve un problema con la pantalla que al quitar la mica que ya viene incluida la pantalla esta muy rayada, pero al colocar mica de cristal como si nada!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En verdad es una excelente opcion precio/calidad, lo recomiendo ampliamente, puedes comprar con seguridad, de impuestos me regresaron 13 USD, fenomenal. Llego a Mexico super rapido."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tengan cuidado y chequen el numero del modelo, pues en mi cas recientemenete me di cuenta que no es compatible con la banda 28 en México"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llevo ya varias semanas de uso y esta excelente, se ve casi como nuevo, es una excelente opción si estás buscando cambiar de equipo!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente estado del teléfono, funciona de maravilla y fue un buen upgrade del 7 que tenía a este. El hecho de ser “renewed” no ha afectado en nada por lo que lo recomiendo ampliamente, la batería del mío llego al 100% que era lo que más me preocupaba y la estética no tenía ni un solo detalle"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó, me duró un día y se apagó y no prendió mas, intenté el reinicio forzado por DFU. Y no. Lo regresé."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular vino en perfecto estado? bateria al 98% de su capacidad. el unico detalle es que viene en una caja cualquiera y con un cargador fake pero que igual funciona. Por el estaso del celular 10/10, venia con mica"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto llegó intacto, parece como si lo hubieran sacado de la caja de apple y lo hubieran enviado, ni un sólo rayón. Sí vino con protector de pantalla puesto, capacidad de pila al 100%, la capacidad si es la que mencionan, face ID funciona normal, envío súper rápido de 1 día y no tuve problemas para usarlo ya que si estaba 100% desbloqueado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pésimo producto con muchos rayones y no parece ni cerca a estar como nuevo es un producto con mucho uso"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Súper bien el equipo, bastante satisfecho 👌"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El estado de la batería es de 97%. Luce como nuevo, no tiene defectos estéticos, un punto muy pequeño en una esquina y una pequeña rayita cerca al puerto de carga. Funciona bien, cámaras, botones, pantalla touch, bocinas, altavoces, micrófonos y FaceID."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en excelente estado y empacado y hasta el momento funciona súper súper bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto llego en mal estado ya que la pantalla venia con un rayon muy profundo , hasta parece estrellado, la bocina de llamadas se escucha ronca y con ruido y el embalaje queda mucho a desear, la bateria tenia un 82% y se calento al cargarlo ya que llego con un 10%"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo venía en excelentes condiciones , quizá alguna raya o raspón pero casi imperceptibles"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Parecía como nuevo sin detalle alguno y con la batería al 100% pero se me hizo raro que tuviera cristal proyector, a los 3 meses me se estrelló poquito el cristal protector y al quitárselo para ponerle otro vi que la pantalla estaba rayada y con el cristal no se le nota nada. De darme cuenta desde el principio que estaba así de rayada lo devuelvo sin pensarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Fue una excelente compra, me costo el 60% de lo que tendría que haber pagado por un equipo nuevo, y las funciones hasta ahora han estado como si lo fuera. De no ser que no tiene los accesorios y caja original, podría pasar por un aparato nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen producto, lastima la duración de la batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo parece realmente nuevo, viene con su cable y cargador genérico, así como una llave. Tiene unos ligeros y no visibles rayas en la pantalla pero es de esperarse. La pila está al 90% de su capacidad. Creo que es una buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Esta completamente nuevo en exterior, 85% de vida de batería y cable y caja de conexión genérico. Bien!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular si esta en estetica de 8.6, el unico inconveniente es la bateria, dura entre 3 horas de uso maximo, pero tomando en cuenta el precio y el precio del reemplazo es proporcional al costo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Que parece nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","It works very well"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En cuanto estética llegó Perfecto pero me llegó con una condición de 83% la cual no le tomo importancia reconociendo que es renewed, contaba con un fallo en la bosina que no se escuchaba casi nada, más a parte que las cámaras se veían poco borrosas."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó con el micrófono sin funcionar, no creo que los revisen como mencionan en la publicación."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cuando recién abrí el producto se veía en perfectas condiciones. Ni un solo rasguño. Mi primer duda fue al encenderlo. No funcionó el botón de encendido. Después de encenderlo al conectarlo con el cable de luz inicie el proceso de configuración. El celular constantemente se bloqueaba y se escuchaba el sonido típico de bloqueo de los iPhone. Era imposible usar el móvil así, sin embargo después de un tiempo logré configurarlo. Intenté actualizarlo a la versión iOS 14.3 (la última a este día) con la esperanza de que esto solucionara el problema, sin embargo, al estarse instalando se apagó el móvil (pienso que por el falso que tenía el botón lateral) y al apagarse al actualizarse el firmware quedó inservible y no funcionó más, solo encendiendo en modo recuperación. Intenté actualizarlo y recuperarlo desde iTunes, sin embargo, me marcaba error una y otra vez y lamentablemente, después de varios intentos, tuve que devolverlo. Por lo visto fue una falla del Hardware que no “reacondicionaron” al sacarlo a la venta. He leído reseñas muy buenas y otras nada buenas sobre los celulares reacondicionados y creo que es cuestión de suerte, por eso es que ya hice la orden de otro celular en espera de la devolución de este."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es primera vez que compro un celular renovado y he quedado totalmente sorprendida y satisfecha. Tengo 3 días con el y todo ha marchado correctamente, volveré a actualizar este comentario en 3 meses de haberlo utilizado (antes de que se acabe la garantía) tiene un pequeño rayón en la Parte de arriba pero nada que afecte al dispositivo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular me llego con la pila Justo al 80%,Dije no esta mal pero al momento de cargarlo se calentaba demasiado dije bueno lo dejo pasar pero cuando puse mi chip/si card no hagarronpobre con otras y menos, lo regrese."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","el producto físicamente esta impecable muy bonito , funciona bien el único detalle es que descompone los cargadores y es imposible estar comprando cargadores originales cada dos semanas llevo 3 cargadores marca apple comprados directamente que se descomponen y tambien se descompuso el generico que me enviaron en 1 semana pero creí al principio que era por que no era el original los demas cargadores despues lo vi como coincidencia pero pues ya fe mucho es lo unico que duran intente ver la politica de 90 dias de garantia pero por ningun lado me aparecen no recominedo comprar por que para poder probar 30 dias es muy poco tiempo para saber que fallos tienen"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pero tenia 84% de battery life y alrededor de 500 ciclos de carga. Lo devolví"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenia mis dudas de que el teléfono llegara en buen estado sin detalles estéticos ni operativos pero me llevé una agradable sorpresa al recibirlo sin ningún daño estético, operando sin problemas y con su batería al 99% de vida, Seminuevo como Nuevo. Además que me llego dos días antes de lo programado. Satisfacción Total."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me gusta que la estética de lo que compro aún cuando es usado este al 10 de 10 aquí como lo compro por medio de Amazon pues no lo puedo ver físicamente, El único detalle que tiene que le veo ese es dos laterales vienen maltratados de ahí en fuera todo bien!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía miedo de que fuera estafa pero al final valió la pena la compra. El teléfono es prácticamente nuevo sin ningún detalle estético. Me llego en 2 días, solo el empaque es lo malo y que no viene en su caja original ni cargador original pero por el precio está bien, queda en segundo término. Me llego con 94% de vida de batería, esta perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Producto como nuevo, con un 85% de batería , no viene con caja original ni cargador ni accesorios"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tengo ya 3 meses de uso más o menos y todo ha sido excelente, desde que me lo dieron venía con el 100% de vida de la batería y protector de pantalla, obvio viene en otra caja y con otro cargador pero es lo de menos, la mejor compra !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen estado general solo microrayones que se ven poniéndole mucha atención. No me gusto que a la semana les hicieron un muy buen descuento."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","De lo mejor!! El equipo como nuevo piña al 97% y sin desgaste en general.Sólo el cargador es de baja calidad por que el cable que incluyen es bueno.En general una muy buena compra; Esperaré a tener más tiempo de uso con el para dar más detalles."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy bien teléfono"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estética 10/10, ni un rasguño, en perfectas condiciones. Lo escaneé en 3utools y todo es original, más de 300 cargas con 93% de batería. Llegó con 95%, pero bajó después de la configuración. Está un poco lento el desplazamiento en pantalla, pero será cuestión de usarlo más para ver si es alguna falla"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Encantado con el Producto!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono viene en un caja genérica , con cargador y cable genérico , está en excelentes condiciones , lo que ves es lo que recibes decía que podría tener algún defecto físico pero en mi caso no fue así, sirve al cien yo solo si recomiendo que le compren los accesorios originales. Estoy feliz"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía mis dudas al comprar un celular reacondicionado, pero el que he comprado a llegado como NUEVO! la batería esta al 100%, no tiene ningun detalle (más que un pequeñito rasguño en la pantalla) que con un buen protector no se aprecia. El telefono viene completamente liberado y trae un cargador generico y cable. Estoy muy feliz de mi compra y del dinero que me he ahorrado! (además de contriibuir al ambiente)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó en perfectas condiciones, parecía nuevo, funciona al 100% y la batería esta casi al 100, con un 85%. Lo compré hace varios meses y no he tenido ningún problema. Súper contenta con mi compra!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cuando compras un equipo reparado se corre el riesgo de que salgan defectos. En este caso es una pena en el caso de las llamadas. Si estoy en una, se corta sin aviso previo. Dos segundos después entra otra llamada que hace se corte la anterior."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en excelente condición y con 96% de batería, estéticamente luce como nuevo, muy cuidado, llegó con mica de cristal, el único detalle fue que no llegó en caja original y el cargador es genérico."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En general el celular venía en buen estado, con 88% de batería pero lo que no me gustó es que traía unos rayones bastante profundos y que no se notaban porque traía la mica protectora pero al quitársela me di cuenta de eso y mejor lo devolví. Deberían de dejar de engañar al comprador con eso."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono viene como nuevo, solo le encontré un pequeño rayón y nada más, lo he estado utilizando sin fallas o problema alguno, esperaba q la pila tuviera cierto desgaste y al revisar el rendimiento la encontré al 100, el cargador no original, es lo q no me gusto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo llegó en excelentes condiciones. Realmente cumple con todas las expectativas, la batería en condición del 100% y sin ningún detalle."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono te lo entregan con una mica ya puesta y se le ve como un pegamento no le tome importancia al principio, la sorpresa viene al retirarla la pantalla esta súper rayada entiendo que sean productos renewed pero es un exceso el daño en la pantalla se le ven los ratones de uso normal pero además de eso trae varios rayones ya pronunciados en pantalla hasta parece cuarteadura"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en perfectas condiciones, estaba un poco nervioso con respecto a cómo llegaría el equipo, pero prácticamente llego cómo nuevo, ningún solo rayón, la batería al 100% de su capacidad. Además llegó con una mica de cristal puesta. De no ser porque viene en una caja genérica con accesorios genéricos creería que es totalmente nuevo. Ya no cuenta con garantía limitada de Apple, pero con la garantía de Amazon está perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad tuve mis dudas al realizar mi compra pero al final todo salió bien, el equipo llego a tiempo y condiciones que no me lo imaginaba, lo recomiendo al 100% a mi experiencia."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular por fuera OK. Ya cuando lo configuré resulta que la batería tiene un 77% dd capacidad cuando según Amazon este celular debería tener arriba del 80%. Ya el mismo celular me manda aviso que la batería está muy degradada y debe dársele mantenimiento porque se encuentra muy degradada según el mismo iPhone. Se supone que Amazon lo debió revisar antes pero no fue así. Lo regresaré de inmediato y ya no compraré más productos renewed, mejor a juntar dinero y comprarme uno nuevo. Ya estoy cansado de darle muchas oportunidades a los celulares re acondicionados de Amazon, tirola toalla."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El empaque al ser genérico me dio un poco de desconfianza pero el teléfono llegó en excelentes condiciones, estética al 100, revisé en un programa las partes del teléfono y todo de fábrica, no a fallado hasta el momento.. lo recomiendo por el precio y los meses sin intereses"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono esta en muy buenas condiciones, de estética le doy un 10, la vida de la batería esta al 100%, sin duda estoy muy satisfecho de esta compra, los accesorios no son originales pero funcionan muy bien, pero en la publicación te lo indican, la caja es genérica y en conclusión el teléfono esta divino y a un super precio👍👏👏👏"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llego con demaciados rayones y golpes en los bordes y además la bocina sonaba muy mal, lastima lo tuve que regresar"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Poco rendimiento en la batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El articulo llego tal cual se prometio, ahora solo espero que dure bien a largo plazo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","UNA ABSOLUTA VERGÜENZA QUE AMAZON DIGA QUE ESTOS TELÉFONOS REFABRICADOS FUERON REVISADOS Y TESTEADOS POR “EXPERTOS” PARA LUCIR Y FUNCIONAR COMO NUEVOS.El teléfono que me llego no Se quedaba sin señal de manera Intermitente, haciéndolo prácticamente inservible. Además se calentaba desproporcionadamente. Estando en reposo llegaba a temperaturas como si estuvieras jugado. Me imagino que ambos problemas están relacionados y radican en la placa madre del teléfono. Absoluta vergüenza."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular me llego súper rápido, vienen en caja genérica. Es producto original, de estética le doy 10 y batería 10. Ya tengo 5 meses usándolo y sin ningún problema la verdad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was excited to take a chance on an amazon renewed product, however I can't say it's worth the price after all. The battery does not last long at all, and the screen itself had some deep scratches that affect what you see on-screen. The condition was fine elsewhere on the device, but I think they tried to hide the deep scratches on the screen by putting a screen protector on. To pay over $1,000 for something like this, I just don't think it's worth it at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego en perfecto estado, batería al 100%, me preocupaba que llegara dañado o algún problema estético pero no, la verdad es que me sorprendió"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I was so surprise ! It looks brand new! Battery is at 99%. I definitely recommend this product!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto vienen en las mejores condiciones pero no me gustaron las medidas y muy pequeño y quiero cambiarlo por una versión PRO MAX...¿Es posible hacer este cambio?"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Equipo sin señal, es decir no liberado para Telcel por lo menos y se calienta al cargarse"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El aparato llegó empacado en una caja genérica (como era de esperarse), con un cargador y cable también genéricos. El aspecto del aparato es impecable, no tiene ningún rasguño o señal alguna de uso previo. Venía con todo y un vidrio templado ya preinstalado.Sólo la instalación de mi AppleID fue algo trabajosa, porque el aparato no venía actualizado y pidió que se actualizara a la última versión del iOS para poder trasladar mis contenidos de mi viejo iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo único que no me agradó es que no son originales, el cubo y cable para cargar el teléfono"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lamentablemente tuve 2 problemas pero el principal es que al abrirlo venia una bateria de steren y y unos audifonos de baja calidad que ademas estaban rotos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto tiene PESIMO desempeño inalámbrico. Es muy difícil conectar con redes WiFi y el Bluetooth también tiene muy mal desempeño. En realidad se vuelve un producto inservible. QUISIERA CAMBIARLO POR FAVOR"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Jamás compren reacondicionado de Amazon. En menos de 3 meses ya le tuve que cambiar la batería y a la pantalla le acaba de salir la línea verde.En fin, mi error por comprar reacondicionado y no de fábrica."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iphone viene en perfecto estado. Yo crei que podia venir algun desperfecto, pero no fue asi.Viene con un cable y un cubo para cargar (no son originales) pero cumplen perfectamente su función.Viene incluso con una malla protectora para la parte de enfrente.Yo tenia un iphone y no me costo NADA de trabajo pasar mi informacion de un telefono a otro.Viene totalmente desbloqueado.Buena compra!! :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estoy tienesl problemas con el celular como puedo hacer para devolverlo ya que me dijeron que tenía una garantía de 90 días"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","NO TIENE SEÑAL. Después de cumplir los 3 meses de garantía el teléfono dejó de recibir señal hice pruebas de fallo de SIM y nada cambie a ESIM y seguía sin funcionar. NO COMPREN ESTE EQUIPO Ya que la garantía de los 3 meses no sirve de nada si va a dejar de funcionar al día 91."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","He comprado previamente refurbished y ha sido buena experiencia , por lo que decidi comprar nuevamente y no fue la excepcion"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El aparato llega con cargador y caja genérica, a los pocos meses deja de funcionar el Face ID y no tiene garantía para ello."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Compré el iPhone 11 Pro y todo en perfecto estado , llego en tiempo y el único inconveniente es que por los 15k que pague la batería venía al 85% bastante gastada , aunque estéticamente parece nuevo ."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Las condiciones estéticas del teléfono son increíbles, en realidad podría pasar por un teléfono nuevo, el estado de la batería estaba al 93 lo cual era de esperarse, viene en una caja distinta y el cable y cubo para cargarlo no son originales, pero se entiende al ser Renewed. La verdad si estás pensando en comprar uno así, no lo dudes"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo excelente, volveria a comprar."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Good shape. Does have slight scratches covered by screen protector. Battery came in with 100% health, very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me gustó lo bien cuidado del teléfono, lastima que no me tocó de esos que tienen más del 90% de vida útil de la batería, me costó 14900 en hotsale para que tengan referencia de precios"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La pantalla se ve horrible , claramente no es la original , por el precio del producto deberían preocuparse por al menos poner la original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llegó en muy buenas condiciones como nuevo estaba escéptico pero me sorprendió"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono traía ligeros raspones, nada considerable en su función sólo en lo estético yo le daría en 90% de calificación en estética y la pila 88% pero en general todo buen cargador y cable genéricos"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llegó en muy buenas condiciones estéticas e incluía un vidrio templado, creo que me tocó suerte porque la batería estaba al 100%. Quizás lo único que no me gustó mucho fueron los accesorios genéricos pero fue muy buena compra, si lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me llego en perfecto estado no presenta visibles marcas y trae condición de batería de 94, viene en caja genérica y con cargador genérico pero por el precio no me quejo el equipo que es lo principal viene súper bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Esta increíble el equipo la verdad, esta impecable, batería al 95%, , estoy muy satisfecho, excelente servicio, con el cargador si quedan un poco mal, más que nada el cubo de carga, pero vale la pena ya que como comento mi equipo está nuevo realmente."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","me llegó con una bateria al 95% de salud y casi como nuevo, tiene unas marcas casi imperceptibles en la pantalla pero es de esperarse de un producto renovado, me gustaría que trajera el cargador original pero en cuanto a lo ofrecido todo esta bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone llego en tiempo y forma.No presenta detalles físicos.Batería al 99%.IMEI sin reporteExcelente compra, prácticamente nuevo!!Refurbished es gran opción. Apenas tengo 2 días usando el teléfono pero sin problema."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Lo he estado probando y salvo la batería que alcanza un 94%, todo lo demás hasta ahora funcionando muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto excelente, no tenía ningún detalle físicamente hablando, la batería al 100% y hasta el momento todo ha funcionado correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo básicamente como nuevo, sin ninguna marca, lo único la batería al 91% de vida sin embargo dura muchísimo tiempo, desde hace 4 días que tengo el equipo solo lo he cargado 2 veces, en verdad estoy muy contenta con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Comprar un celular Renewed con Amazon es equivalente a comprar un semi nuevo certificado con garantía de 3 meses, es la 3era vez que compro un renewed y siempre superan mis expectativas , llegó súper rápido , desbloqueado, detalles mínimos 9.5/10 ( solo los rayones normales que se les hacen a los iPhone con bordes de acero inoxidable) batería con condición al 96% funciona todo al 100% y si dejara de hacerlo Amazon te respalda durante 3 meses, sin duda una excelente compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Nuevamente BuySPRY no me deja mal. Buen celular, buena condición de batería, y la estética como de un iPhone nuevo. Incluso los accesorios n originales cable y cargador funcionan y dan la carga rápida."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego bastante bien, en caja genérica, con cubo y cable genérico.Sin defectos estéticos y con la pila al 93%Muy buena opción."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El equipo venia impecable y con 93% de batería. El único ""defecto"" son los cargadores con los que te lo envían pero vale bastante la pena ya que el equipo en cuestión de funcionamiento y estética está al millón"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El día sábado 28 de mayo recibí el celular, a primera vista estaba en perfectas condiciones. Todo OK hasta el día de hoy martes 31 de mayo, cuando recibí una actualización de IOS 15.5 y detectó una falla en la pantalla y la batería, al ingresar al enlace me manda directamente a una página de sugerencias para acudir al servicio técnico de APPLE, argumentando que las piezas son de menor calidad."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No agarrala señal sin internet!!! Ayuda"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estoy sorprendido del estado, no tiene un solo rasguño ni en la pantalla, ni el los bordes, por lo que he leído en los demás comentarios, tuve suerte. La batería funciona al 94%. Excelente!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sin detalles estéticos, pero el Face ID no funciona"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sabía que era reconstruido pero ya de iPhone sólo tenía la carcasa, la pantalla se veía con colores muy opacos, nada que ver con cualquier pantalla del iPhone 5 en adelante, además se trataba el sistema operativo a ratos y no funcionaba el touch correctamente, tuve que regresarlo. Eso si no tuvieron problema en devolverme el dinero solo asegúrense de darse de baja del iCloud antes de regresarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","A pesar de no ser nuevo de paquete, están en muy buen estado, vale la pena ya que vienen como nuevos y por un precio mucho menor, con respecto a la caja es genérica igualmente el cargador pero insisto, por el precio y la calidad del producto vale la pena y lo recomiendo bastante."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego muy usado, golpes por todas partes, cargador genérico no funcional. 70% batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad es que llegó muy rapido, lo compré el domingo 27 de dic y me llegó el martes 29, la caja era generica así como el cable usb y el cargador pero de buena calidad, la bateria del dispositivo con 97% de vida útil, estética de 9.9, la verdad estoy contento con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En relación calidad-precio es la mejor opción, el celular llegó como nuevo, por más que busqué no encontré ningún rayón o imperfección. Lo recomiendo 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy buen producto, con dos pequeños rayones pero no se notan especialmente con funda"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Demasiados rayones en la pantalla y la parte de atrás, los cromos muy dañados y si lo usas por cierto tiempo se calienta"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente celular como nuevo bateria al 100 % lo malo es que viene en caja generica y cargador generico pero el equipo impecable, seria bueno que por unos pesos mas incluyeran caja y cargador original"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me lo compré para mi, hasta ahora funciona perfecto, no se calienta, se carga rápido, venia con cargador (no de la marca) y venia en caja (no de la marca)."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me encanto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Estaba con la duda si debería comprarlo porque no sabía si el equipo estaría en buen estado, y me sorprendió que el equipo llegó impecable, gran precio, no tiene ni un rasguño, la batería está al 100, es prácticamente nuevo, estoy muy feliz."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Engañan al comprador ocultando los defectos.No recomiendo compren este tipo de artículos, siempre traen detalles, en mi caso, no me percaté de inmediato que la pantalla tenía raspones ya que el producto incluía una mica de cristal templado, cuando la sustituí me llevé la sorpresa que la pantalla presentaba muchas imperfecciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego con las bocinas reventadas y el nivel de volumen parece alterado, no suena casi nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Compré un iPhone 11 pro de 256 gb con el 100% de vida de la bateria y solo habiendo recibido 30 ciclos de carga, un minimo rayon en un lateral que ya con funda ni siquiera se nota. Completamente satisfecho, buena compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Me sorprendió bastante, el producto llegó intacto y en perfecto estado. En efecto, los accesorios son genéricos, pero si ya habías tenido iPhone, esto no es un problema. Hasta hoy ha funcionado muy bien. ¡Estoy muy contenta con mi compra!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","1.- La batería no dura nada la trae al 86%.2.- Viene bloqueado con USA no puedo usar mi red de telefonía.3.- Se calienta a los 20 minutos de usarlo.4.- El cargador genérico se sobrecalento demasiado solo lo use 1 vez.5.- No puedo hacer cambio de nada con garantía porque es de Estados Unidos y aquí no vale la garantía de apple.Total estafa."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono funciona bien pero la pantalla tiene muchos rayones los cuales son muy visibles. la batería apenas llega a 82% de vida."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono estéticamente se veia bien , pero lamentablemente no reconocía el chip , por lo que no puedo opinar al respecto , ya que lo tuve que devolver"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía mis dudas pero llego súper bien, sin ningún rasguño ni nada por el estilo, el mío llego con 99% de batería. Llevo casi 1 mes con el y todo súper bien, recomendado!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","This device came with a random (non-apple) aftermarket display with plastic black edges. The brightness of this display cannot be adjusted more than 10% from peak, so you're stuck with near max brightness even when using it at night. The touch sensitivity is almost non-existent. It is so insensitive that it's next to impossible to type as it misses every 5th or so touch.It also has glue marks around the edges of the display and back glass.$900+ for a makeshift 64gb 11 Pro when the 13 Pro's are out is madness. This price would be too high if it came brand new in the box. Look to Marketplace or eBay."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono cumple con las expectativas, muy buen producto y en excelentes condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Súper buena oferta, llego como nuevo, sin rasguños y daños"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hoy recibí el celular, estéticamente le doy un 10/10, la condición de batería aparece con 100%. El cargador es genérico (como decía en la descripción) y no trae nada más. Hasta el momento todo bien, después de 2 meses les comparto qué tal va."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llege el color incorrecto :( Cuesta mucho por llegar incorrecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cuando llego creí que me habían estafado ya que el empaque y la caja son de otro tipo, el teléfono llego en excelentes condiciones 0 rayones le daría un 10 de 10 y tenía 91% de vida útil en la batería, le funciona todo el cargador es genérico pero si le funciona."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente producto recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad mi experiencia fue neutra. Si la calidad de la batería estaba por encima del 80%, no es cierto que vienen “como nuevos”. Me tocó un equipo totalmente usado venía golpeado y con grietas en la parte trasera. Hay una gran diferencia entre un equipo renovado y un equipo de segundo uso, pero bueno el precio es aceptable para el valor original y poca depreciación de un iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es la mejor compra que he realizado en Amazon. Me llegó impecable. Con batería 95"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Una maravilla, el iPhone llegó sin un rasguño, la bateria al 95% y todo funcionando perfecto. practicamente nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Pésimo, tenía mis dudas pero después de leer varios reviews buenos me anime a pedirlo, el peor error que he hecho, llegó en pésimo estado, pantalla rallada, no tiene tapa para la entrada del chip, tiene mordisqueados los lados, no tiene una pieza frontal al lado del flash frontal, y para acabar ni siquiera carga.Sigue sin cargar nada después de horas. Probablemente no tiene batería. Una completa estafa0/10 en general"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Solo tenía un golpe en la esquina y unos arañasos muy muy pequeños en la pantalla. Nada que afecte el funcionamiento. Para ser el de máxima capacidad fue una ganga, muy bonito y la batería al 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente compra aprovechando el descuento que hubo, llegó un día antes de lo esperado.Estética 10/10 no tiene ni un solo detalle en la pantalla ni en los bordes ni por la parte trasera.Batería 97% de vidaAdemás viene con un protector de pantalla incluído 👌🏽"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo muy bien salvo que no llego en la caja de apple"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","I have just received my iPhone 11 Pro. The first problem I know is it’s my front camera isn’t working. I bought this phone because of the camera and you guys forgot to mention that the front camera isn’t working. Battery life okay, touchscreen okay but I don’t think that I pay money for something to be missing."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto como nuevo una ligera mancha en el borde por donde se bloquea el celular pero es mínimo, viene con un cristal en la pantalla ya integrado, la batería esta full 100% muy buena compra no tiene ningún detalle es muy buena inversion"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En la publicación dice que viene con un mínimo de 90% de vida de la batería pero me llego con el 86%. Personalmente lo regresaré porque esperaba más del celular."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Hola. El día de hoy recibí mi celular, esteticamente 10/10... lo que me causa conflicto es que no puedo utilizar el celular porque me pide un código alfanumérico, intenté ingresar un número que venía pegado en la parte de atrás, el cuál creí que era el código pero no es. No seguí intentando porque el celular empezó a bloquearse ya que la contraseña no era la correcta.Si alguien pudiera ayudarme, se lo agradecería."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Adquiri el telefono el 4 de octubre del 2020 y el 5 de noviembre ya no quiso prender y lo lleve a ishop mixep para repararlo y me dijeron que ya no habia nada que hacer que estaba inservible. Solo 3 meses me duro y ni uma vez se me cayo ni nada, no regalen su dinero comprando un cel reacondicionado les sale mucho mejor comprarlo nuevo, yo aun lo estoy pagando y ya ni sirve."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Está en excelentes condiciones, el iPhone viene con un 99% de la vida de la pila. Tiene un poco raspadas las orillas, pero nada del otro mundo y con funda ya no se nota.Excelente compra, sobre todo por el precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","La verdad es una buena compra estoy muy satisfecho. El teléfono me llegó en excelente estado no tiene alguna marca ni rayadura la pila está al 100% en estas dos semanas de uso ha funcionado bien y no ha fallado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","se ve bien el producto pero el microfono tiene falla.....suena my mal (como con echo y distorcionado como bajo el agua)......no lo puedo usar para hacer contenido (la razon 1 para tenerlo)"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","iphone en perfectas condiciones, llego con 98% vida de bateria osea literalmente como nuevo el unico detalle esta en el empaque ya que es generico y no tiene la caga ni los cargadores originales de apple"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El teléfono llego como nuevo, sin rayones o golpes."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Yo esperaba por la garantía de Amazon que iban a checar los celulares con algo más de rigurosidad. El teléfono estaba en muy malas condiciones de la pantalla y tenía una rayadura que era muy notoria incluso a 1 brazo de distancia, como menciona la garantía. Por eso lo he devuelto, pero la experiencia de usuario con el reembolso es definitivamente deficiente :(("
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en excelentes condiciones. Ni un rayón y la batería al 100%. Por menos de 14 mil está excelente. Incluso llegó con mica de cristal ya instalada."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente en estética 10/10 llego a tiempo 98% la condición de la batería carga al 100 sin problema , el teléfono llega con mica de cristal excelente producto"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó en tiempo récord, como si fuera nuevo. El cargador no es original, pero funciona. No viene con audífonos. En muy buen estado, solo un pequeño rasguño en la parte superior de la pantalla.Excelente opción por el precio.Hay opción de compra a meses sin intereses"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El Iphone estaba en excelentes condiciones. Probé absolutamente todo por que estaba muy escéptico y todo funciona muy bien. FaceID, conexión con airpods, bocina, pantalla original.Si llega en una caja de cartón con accesorios genéricos pero decentes.Estoy muy satisfecho."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No esperaba mucho al ser un producto renewed pero me sorprendió bastante las condiciones en las que se presentaba, si no fuera porque la batería estaba al 96% y no venía en su empaque original parecería nuevo.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","AAA+++ Execellent product, the seller it’s really nice and fast shipping !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo bien con el celular, ni un rasguño, todo en orden."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy mala experiencia, físicamente traía raspaduras y golpes, las bocinas no se escuchaban y no contaba con piezas internas originales . El mismo sistema del iPhone no reconocía las piezas como la pantalla y audio y marcaba error. No entiendo cómo pueden vender productos así de defectuosos. “No lo recomiendo”"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buen precio y ninguna falla en estos primeros 4 meses."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Excelente opción para comprar un teléfono son desembolsar cantidades exageradas. Mi teléfono llego con una duración de batería del 96% y sin ningún detalle de uso"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Este fue el primer pedido que hice, lo devolví porque las bocinas venían con mucha distorsión. Hice un segundo pedido del iPhone esperando uno mejor y me mandaron UNA BATERÍA. Evítense un mal rato comprando aquí."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Realmente nuevo, ninguna marca de uso, batería al 100% de condición! Todo excelente!"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Después de un mes de uso, la cámara empezó a presentar inestabilidad en el zoom"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Es como si estuviese totalmente nuevo no notarás que es Reacondicionado y te dará las mismas funciones que uno nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto no servía"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muchos rayones en pantalla la mayoría rayadura profunda que se nota de lejos y parece fue hecho con una llave"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El producto en sí es muy bueno pero el empaque y el cargador no son originales"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Supongo que tuve suerte, el producto venía con 100% de la capacidad de la batería y sin ningún defecto, como nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Tenía un poco de miedo por ser renovado. Pero excelente artículo. Recibí todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Buena inversión totalmente recomendable"

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Sé que el celular es reacondicionado y no puedo exigir que venga como si lo comprara nuevo, pero el celular venía sucio, todo rayado de los bordes y otros rayones en la pantalla.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Todo bien viene como nuevo pero sin accesorios el cargador al parecer si es de carga rápida aunque se ve muy feo."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En términos de funcionalidad no hay problema. Pero en la estética, el teléfono traía un rayón oculto con la mica protectora.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Muy mala compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Malísimo, iPhone no vale la pena para el precio que tiene. El dispositivo llegó rayones en la parte superior, y en la cámara. Se calienta un buen al cargársele.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Cuando llego el teléfono, todo inicio bien pero al momento de actualizar mis datos y ios a la versión actual, el teléfono no reaccionó.

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","En la descripción indican claramente que él producto debe lucir como nuevo y definitivamente este no luce así, está muy rayado."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Como nuevo. Cero detalles"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","No me gusto"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El celular está sumamente rayado de pantalla y cámaras, lo devolví, creo que es mejor invertir en uno nuevo, o al menos me tocó una mala experiencia."

"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Mic didn’t work well. But at least I got a refund in a timely manner."
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llego con una mica de vidrio la cual era para disimular rallones pero lo peor es que no funcionaba el Face ID! nunca se pudo configurar"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","Llegó muy rayada la pantalla y le ponen un protector de pantalla para que no te des cuenta"
"Apple","iPhone 11 Pro","El iPhone funciona perfecto, pero la pantalla esta muy rayada
Con la mica que viene no se nota, pero si se la quitas son evidentes los rayones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is clean and works well, i haven’t had any issues in the few weeks i’ve had it. It came with a battery health of 90% meaning they didn’t put a new battery in so thats something to keep in mind."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived very quickly. Great condition. Like new really. No scrathes, cracks or dents. It is a gift, so have not started the phone up as of yet. So unable to rate with stars at this time. But 5 stars for how it looks and its condition. Wrapped nice and safe for shipping. Great company with quality products."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone 6 months ago and lemme tell you it works it awesome feeling an iPhone in your hands the only problem is the battery is dying out the more you use it but overall it works fine the phone came in good condition no scratches or anything like that👍🏼"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This will be my first iPhone ever and so far it’s looking good. I was a little skeptical to get a refurbished device but it’s better than I hoped for honestly. There are no physical scratches, everything so far runs smoothly. Would definitely recommend getting this"
"Apple","iPhone 11","First iphone (a Five) I bought from this vendor, lasted years, until it was outdated.

Second iphone (11) was defective, vendor promptly issued a full refund. I bought my third iphone 11 from the SAME VENDOR, it was excellent! When I need another phone, I will look up this vendor!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We love that we can buy top-of-the-line electronics at a friendly price! Getting the cell phone carrier to help us get it working was a little harder but persistence pays off handsomely. We saved a lot of money and got a superior deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is in near perfect condition. Only complaint is the charging cube that came with the phone was cheap and got overheated as soon as the phone was plugged in (just leave it out). I really enjoy Apple as a brand because it is honestly just so easy once you are used to it, but I am not someone that needs the newest and just don't really care to pay for the newest. Amazon providing refurbished tech is great for the environment as well as for penny pinchers like me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s a nice phone came a day early but the battery health is only 79% I wish it was at least 85% battery heath also has a couple scratches under the screen protector but all in all it’s a good working phone I’d recommended buying. Came with a screen protector already on it too."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect exterior and comes with screen protector. Facial recognition works perfectly. Battery life of 81%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Upgraded from an iPhone 7. Well-packaged. Clear instruction. Transferred via iCloud in 8 minutes. NO MORE physical SIM cards!!!

It came with a perfectly installed screen protector, which is nice. Me putting one on, always ended up crooked.

Zero flaws and honestly appears brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Haven’t hade any problems with it i love it , i recommend yal buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased a refurbished red iPhone 11. Extremely happy with the phone. Everything works great. There was a small scratch on the screen, but not noticeable when phone is in use. Battery stays charged for hours."
"Apple","iPhone 11","COMPRE EL TELEFONO POR LAS BUENAS REVIEW QUE VI Y NO ME EQUIVOQUE. TIENE ALGUNA QUE OTRA MARCA PERO FUNCIONA EXCELENTE. LA BATERIA ME VINO CAMBIADA Y ENTIENDO QUE ESTA AL 100% PERO NO ME FIGURA LA CONDICION. YO TUVE UNA BUENA EXPERIENCIA."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing!!! I got a yellow for myself and a black for my husband and they are flawless!!! Long battery life, not a single mark anywhere on either phone or screen, and they came with glass screen protectors on! Will definitely return to this seller when we are ready for the 13!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I wasn’t spending a fortune on an apple phone if I could help it. I upgraded after almost 4 years, I don’t upgrade unless I absolutely have to. I get used to my phone and don’t really want to learn another phone lol. This one is sufficient enough for everything I need. I love iPhone and refused to steer away from apple. Great purchase, would buy from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and I’m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they weren’t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and I’ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so can’t say much else."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this as a gift for my mother. It looks brand new and works as such. I’m so impressed with this refurbished phone! My mom loves it too!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was good condition and that's what I got . A few dents on the top side of phone but not bad at all .. love the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product is exactly as described by seller. It had minor scratches but nothing really bad or bothering me. The battery life is better than I expected. I'm very satisfied and definitely would buy it again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","got it for my boyfriend, been about 4 months since he started using it and it’s been going very well so far! there were only a few very minor scratches on the back, not even noticeable. Battery health is expected for a used phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen could of been better. It has alot scratches but still was managable"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phones functioning are really good but you can see scratches on outer surfaces as they been pre owned. The charger they are providing here is not actual Apple charger. The one I received was from ZCOTU company."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I upgraded from an iPhone 6s as a birthday present to myself. I wasn’t willing to pay over $400, didn’t want to see visible wear & tear, needed the phone to be purple. And with this purchase???! BAYY-BEE🗣 got everything I asked for! I love my new phone and I’m so grateful to myself (and the company who I purchased from) for taking the time to find this gem 💎. This was a fast ship too, ordered on 11/15 got it 11/17. Do yourself a favor & take advantage of this deal 🔥‼️

-Aria"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Writing this review after having the phone for a few weeks. It’s awesome. I hate buying refurbished and renewed because I like the “new” feeling you get when buying something never before used (I know lol) but this is the next best. If you don’t have the money for an actual new one, I highly recommend this one"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen came slightly popped out from the phone and there was a minor dent on the side.Other than that there was no other problems, batters was at 91% and face id was working."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love all things “Apple”
This was a gift for a friend who has been struggling on many levels!

The price was excellent!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Brought this refurbished unlocked to use with a plan I purchased through Walmart (forget the name). This worked perfectly. The phone's camera is great (not like the latest pixel) but still worth the price along with the memory, etc."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought a new phone for Christmas and I got this one and it work’s awesome I love it in every way! Also it came in the mail fast!! Thanks Amazon!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Almost perfect condition! 92% battery life! The only thing was a tiny scratch on the front that isn’t very visible in the first place and disappeared completely when I put on a screen protector. If you want to save yourself a couple hundred dollars I highly recommend buying one of these!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There are so many scratches on the screens."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very surprised with the refurbished iPhone 11. I figured there would be a few light scratches or scuffs but looks like it just came from the apple factory!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bang for your buck!!! Like new couldn’t complain one bit speaker loud camera looks great everything works perfect and was able to start my service on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pretty good for now. Expected more for the “excellent condition” as the phone has a little scratch on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone is great! it came with a screen protector. the screen protector had minor scratches and so was some of the camera, but that was expected with a refurbished. i had a 7 plus so this is quite of an upgrade but i love it! it did NOT come with a sim card but did come with the thing to open it & a charger/box piece. it’s also unlocked so it was the easiest thing to set up. i love this phone, thank u cell surfers!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was hesitant to purchase a used phone, and it worked out very well. The iPhone looks perfect, and the yellow does not disappoint. This is my big move from Android to Apple, and it has been seamless. I am very impressed with what Amazon has delivered. Great job!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No. CRacks on back, lil scratches on screens no biggie everything worked perfectly, daughter extremely pleased"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Besides the few nicks which don't affect it at all, my iPhone 11 is in top shape. Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay but the facial recognition is where it is at. Amazing detail for the retina display and tons of useful features and apps. It was really easy to set up. the generic cable and power brick both work great. Though the cable is a little on the short side. But since I previously had an iPhone SE, I happen to still have longer cables. And now I can make full use of my home pod mini. The price is well worth it with how slight the damage was. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a case. But I am sure to get one soon. Bluetooth on this device is amazing reaching every corner of where I live without caring around the device. I just wanted to test it out. The best feature is the battery which charges in about half an hour. And lasts all day. That is with a heavy battery use live wallpaper. I switched from Android and don't miss it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this phone for my 17-year-old son. He asked for a brand-new phone, and I laughed. He loses just about everything. Getting this phone was a compromise and he had the advantage because the phone is perfect. No scratches on screen or back and battery is between 90-98%. I've heard buying reconditioned phones is a risky venture. Not in this case. It was everything they promised and more."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical, but from reading All of the reviews I decided to take a chance. I’m glad I did. Everything works perfect. No scratches whatsoever."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was great and a huge save towards my bank account. Battery came at 100% everything looks and works perfect! Would recommend this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works fine, but the problem is the speaker which it wasn’t loud enough. For the rest of this iPhone, it works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in excellent working condition. Seller is reliable and responsive. Would recommend purchasing a refurbished phone from this seller before paying full price for something new. Great deal on the iPhone 11 in like-new condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about purchasing a phone through Amazon but I took a risk and it was worth it. The phone itself was clean, not scratched, and looks completely new. Wasn’t disappointed and would definitely buy from this company again in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face ID works well ,only complaint is the battery life was 84% when delivered and the back screen light dims from time to time but it’s a good phone ! Came with charger and screen protector!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great. I’d buy buy a refurbished phone again. This one does respond to touch slowly on occasion."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i like the phone its like a brand new phone witch was fantastic i found close to no scratches or scuff marks whatsoever. but only my phone battery capacity was 78% but i can just buy a Certified iphone battery online for like 20-30 dollars and replace it :D. 9/10 i would show pictures but my computer dosent have a camera. but i 100% recommend buying this product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was my first phone I purchased without any parent money and let me tell it was worth it I still have it is unlocked. I still use it i recently just used it in Korea it still works great I had it for almost a year now"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased as a replacement for a broken phone. If I didn’t know it was previously owned I would have thought it was brand new. Great value for the money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","elular me llegó perfecto sin rayones, limpio entre otras cosas muy bueno, pero en el momento en el q reviso la batería, esta se encuentra en 78% y se supone q pague por uno q debería venir 90% a 100%, esta fue mi única molestia"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The telephone works prefect. I did come with small scratches that you can see from further than 12 inches on the top right hand side of the screen, but it seemed to not matter since it is refurbished. What matters is that everything about the telephone works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent condition, exactly as described by seller. Much thanks to the seller!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the phone in perfect condition and good battery life!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen did have damage upon opening. I am assuming it was damaged somehow in transit because it was a great product other than the screen damage."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone did have trouble getting it to download to iOS 16.1 but overall it is a great phone and was packaged as safe as possible"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I personally think this is a alright reasonable deal. But there will be some ups and down's. One of the ups was that the phone was at, 83 percent battery capacity, also had a great working screen, honestly everything worked well, until I played some music to test the audio. I was flabbergasted, because of how distorted the audio sounded like, because of this I was pretty disappointed, because I am a person that loves music. But if you're a person that's willing to take risk's, buy it, but other than that I am upset, and furious because if you want to return this item you have to go to a ""UPS"" store and additionally pay some money to return it, I am very disappointed be careful, but other than that I am waiting for my money to be refunded back to my bank account, but if you are sure you need a refurbished phone, know that there are risks that come with the phone, which may make the phone nonworking."
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone had a little glitch when i frist recieved it. i just figured maybe i just was seeing things so i continued on. bout two months in same glitch but lasted a minute or so in the top corner. so i figured i better send it back.
Buy spree quickly gave me approval and i printed shipment label and returned the product.
once my phone arrived they gave me a prompt refund of my puchase.

im sorry this didnt work out but i definatly would use buy spree as they back thier stuff.

thanks
Larry"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Loved how quickly it came in. Works like its brand new and didnt have to spend an arm and leg."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I sent this phone to family in another country and it works very well. I am happy we can talk and text plus vedio chat as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone can’t expect perfect condition that’s why I’m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone can’t really see but since I applied a screen protector can’t see it at all 😁. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also can’t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but let’s see how that goes . I’m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and it’s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyone’s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The condition is very good for this phone. I'm happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","UNLOCKED 100% Perfect condition not a problem so far , Fast shipping great price thanks a lot"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got my refurbished Iphone and it stopped working Day 1, went completely brick. But I got my refund and the return was process reasonably quickly without much hassle. Not sure if I'll buy again from this purchaser but I appreciate the ease of handling my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this used phone. It was in perfect condition and it came with a charger. My son is very happy with his new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Having a problem with the volume. When the phone rings or when I'm talking on the phone, the volume goes down. I checked the side for volume control and it's all up.
Is there anything else I can do? Is there a malfunction?"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my everyday phone now. I love it. However I did switch from android to iPhone and I have no complaints so far. Good phone works amazing even if your on the phone all imlay it doesn’t drain that fast"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you I got the iPhone 11 today nice so far is very good phone I got red one I like it👍Work very good brand-new"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came early, I great condition, good battery life, correct colour, doesn't over heat, excellent camera quality and unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","All good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I wasn’t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasn’t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I don’t feel the need just yet because battery is really great. Overall I’m glad I got this because I really needed to upgrade my iPhone 8."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered a purple iphone 11, arrived quickly no problems setting up and works phenomenal. Even came with a screen protector on the front glass as well"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered the iPhone 11. Product arrived in good physical condition. The battery would not stay charged. Once got to 78% would shut down and go to less than 10% battery life. Tried factory reset... everything to keep phone. Returned phone, was well packed in bubble wrap, box and padded envelope. Seller said was returned with a cracked camera housing and kept 30% of our $$$. There were no cracks on the phone when we returned it. This business kept our $$ and we have no recourse. Beware... would not purchase from this seller again.

**Update** Seller reached out and did refund the 'restocking' fee due to our rebuttle about the 'damaged' phone.
.. and to make us a satisfied customer. We support small business and encourage others to as well. This small business did the right thing. Would trust them with another purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in perfect conditions and it works properly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","really good phone and it came like brand new worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good quality refurbished phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sin problema para conexion Tmobile , luce como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with a low battery percentage"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono es para mi hija, hasta ahora funciona bien. La bateria no esta al 100% y el protector de pantalla vino roto. hare el reclamo correspondiente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pedí 2 iPhone 11 para mis hijos, ambos en blanco en estado ""excelente"". Uno realmente estaba en estado excelente, prácticamente sin marcas de uso y con batería al 100%. El otro vino con marcas visibles, en pantalla y en los marcos, más batería al 83%, la verdad esperaba más, ambos funcionan bien, pero creo que el 2do iPhone estaba más para entrar en estado ""muy bueno"", no en excelente. No sé bien cuál será el límite para calificarlo aquí o allá... Me desilucionó un poco."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything fine except the fact that the phone battery life is lower than my iPhone 6 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️😭😒"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone, well it wasn’t too long ago but it works like new and nobody noticed it’s renewed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay. Battery life is ok but not great. The phone is in great condition and is perfect for kids who tend to be less careful with the device."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fantastic, unlocked phone. Was able to transfer all my data from my old Iphone 7 over with no problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came with scratches and chips on the outer surface. Still worked good. I just put a phone cover on it and it looked brand new, but for the money expected the outside to be in better condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in good condition and works fine.But when you are setting it up i recommend setting it up manually,the quick start can freeze the phone and you would have to reset it.Other than that it’s a great phone and when buying keep in mind it does not come with the SIM card.Super good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works so good and I took this with my old phone which is why the pics arnt that good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve used this phone now for a year. Never skips a beat bought it refurbished works like new. The iPhone 11 is still the 4g processor but is no slack on speed. Definitely a great buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery was not that good, after that all was great, well presented"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great and battery is at 100%! Great buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just like it was listed. Good battery life. Good phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall good phone but the phone came in a plastic bag and the “cushion” to protect the phone was just the Amazon box it’s self."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great option for a cheaper iPhone! Battery life is at 87% and the phone looks brand new. $300 for an iPhone 11 is not bad if you can buy at the right time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve been using for a while now. I love the phone greatly. The camera is great and I haven’t received any problems with the phone so far. I love that this phone is 128 gb because my old phone would always run out of storage so fast."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Delivery was fast and i received the phone as expected . It is really in excellent condition and received it with battery at 85%. Been using it for some days it works great! Shipment was received inside a bubbled envelope but the phone was inside a plastic box, so safe. I would reccomend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my 3rd renewed iPhone. The 2 prior phones didn’t have any scratches at all. This iPhone was described as excellent and did have scratches and chips around the camera lens. The battery is also only at 81%. The battery on my older 8 plus trade in was at 83%.
All things considered I took a star off. Its in very good condition not excellent. More importantly the phone is 100% in good working order."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was definitely an upgrade."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought an IPhone 11 for my Daughter that was Delivered really fast looks brand new, very Happy with purchase. Thank you"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I had a few choices when I was shopping for a new phone. There were a several resellers who offered Renewed iPhones on Amazon. I'm glad that I checked their reviews as some had very low ratings and from what I could see they were selling sub-par phones. One I got from MobileSpree is EXCELLENT! 98% battery life, no scratches on display or the back, everything works wonderfully! I'm super satisfied with the purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tenía pequeños arañazos en la pantalla pero funciona bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the issue that my fiancé is having is that the phone will not wake up . so it quite annoying first thing in the morning and you can’t turn off your alarm . and you have 15 selfies every morning of thr 515 am alarm . we rest the factory setting s , the phone is up to date wpthr latetest ios it note it has a off brand screen on it in settings, we even took off the screen protecto and w 3 kids n md no time the waranty just lapsed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone as a secondary phone for work purposes. The battery capacity was at 97% and still at the capacity after 2 months of usage. Unnoticeable wear and tear on the body. Minimal scratches on the screen. I was nervous at first ordering this product but I am glad that I did! Sound works and everything does what it should."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like it and there is nothing wrong with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Would buy it again!! Everything so far works great! It got a little too hot one time when it was being charged, but other than that I def recommend buying from Amazon renewed!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little hesitant, but when I received my phone I was extremely pleased! The condition is excellent, zero scratches one the phone or the screen! It came with a screen protector already installed, so that was a plus! The battery health is at 100%. The phone works perfect! The sound, the camera and performance! I’m very happy and if I ever need a new phone, I’ll definitely purchase from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m in love with this phone !!! It’s amazing nothing wrong with came in like brand new!! Thank you so much."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect for my son and great price for a refurbished unlocked phone. Works great, no issues. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything good great condition the only problem is that the battery health was at 85% when I got it and that isn’t good sure it’s a renewal but whoever used it before had it for a good couple months."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived a day earlier than expected and is in great shape physically. No scratches or defects. Battery health was 83% upon arrival so it meets the claim of at least 80%. No issues with setup, inserting the SIM card, or updating the OS. So far I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is 82%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","everything is working perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've had good luck with buying refurbished iphones. This one seems to be in great condition all around. I really like it. This seller is very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Unable to reset without previous owner's Apple credentials (i.e. - Activation lock is active) and all his data, including photos/videos/contacts/apps, is accessible since no passcode is set! Crazy, to say the least. Was supposed to be a birthday gift, so pretty disappointed Amazon. Please make this right ASAP.

***Update*** Amazon customer service (call) sent a replacement in decent cosmetic condition, but one of the speakerphone/stereo speakers is producing no sound and the other sounds blown, with distortion during high-volume playback of relatively quiet videos. After contacting Amazon customer support, I was taken through a long series of troubleshooting efforts with an Apple technician, only to conclude what was readily apparent; the speakers were faulty. I've been waiting two weeks for the ""escalation team"" to call me and losing confidence quickly. Not a good experience at all. I plan to return the phone and probably will avoid ""Amazon Refurbished"" altogether, in the future. They clearly have a poor QC process in place."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm very happy with this phone, looks and works like brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","First time I ever bought a phone that wasn’t a budget phone under 100 dollars. Last phone was the a10e and the difference is night and day. Everything about it is beautiful. The look and the feel is mesmerizing. Mine came at 100% battery health and I could not find a single dent or scratch on it. Came with a screen protector on it too. Highly recommend it’s an S tier phone for the price to quality ratio."
"Apple","iPhone 11","no scratches, 100% battery and all zin"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the sharpness of the face recognition and the battery life is really good. I charge my iPhone in the night and it last all day. The picture quality is excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product was just as described"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is great! The phone is in great condition! Very pleased!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Renewed iPhone 11 came flawless but had a 3” gray imprint on the white blank screen. Then after hrs of downloading so you can try it out. The speaker sounded terrible like down in a tunnel! The battery got Really hot in 10 mins of use. Couldn’t hold in your hand? So screen damage, speaker messed up and battery trouble… But phone was flawless🤦‍♀️ My second Oder. Trying diff companies hoping for the real deal. Prob best to pay more and go to apple store for renewed phones. At least I got my money back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Trying to find an UNLOCKED iPhone is impossible. The seller not only under promised and over delivered on delivery time, but the phone is in BEAUTIFUL condition and looks brand new!! GREAT purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really wanted an upgrade… the iPhone 11 fit the bill!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Second iPhone 11 purchased in less than 6 months works perfect my wife loves hers and we’ll I love mine thanks for the great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No flaws on exterior, all features work, unlocked works. The battery only had 75% lifespan, which is acceptable for the price point. Thanks!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","A Gift"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works very well , it looks like new , highly recommend to buy a budget iPhone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this for my son who is very happy with the phone so that's what's important to me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono está muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Entrega inmediata y el producto todo ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Easy of setting up and it is a very functional and easy for for my son to use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The Battery life could be better but other that that it’s perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like this upgrade from a 6s plus. It has performed well. Only thing i can gripe about was a couldn’t hear well with phone calls but the ear phone area was dirty. No problem now."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Dirty and the speaker kinda disgusting but fully working and operational for a refurbished iphone you cant get much better"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone seems good so far but I paid for excellent condition and there’s a decent size scuff on the screen and the batter health is at 80%? I wouldn’t have got excellent condition if I knew it’d be like this but a phone is a phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought one of the used models and I have no complaints. It's in perfect form aside from a nearly indistinguishable hairline crack about an inch long in the center. That is to expected from a used model and it is only noticeable when the screen is black. The battery life is excellent as I can go an entire day on one charge which happens in about a 45 minutes to an hour and a half depending on battery level. Camera quality is beautiful compared to my previous iPhone. No complaints!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was so very nervous to buy this phone online but after reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and I can say that I'm pleased. There is a small scratch at the bottom of the phone since it is renewed but I'm still glad I made the purchase!

The phone came in a regular box with a charger (Acellories brand), and the little pin to open the sim card port. It also came with a customer support card, and a amazon renewed thank you card.

I was cautiously optimistic but overall I'm pleased! If I have any issues with this phone, I'll update my review."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like new!! Very pleased"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Easy to setup from a 6s and made a great gift to my fiancé. She loves the iphone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","minor scratches but works perfectly! the battery health was at 90%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I would like to say this is a perfect phone, and it certainly did work perfectly… until exactly 6 months after my purchase, and I mean 6 months TO THE DAY. When it suddenly stopped working, wouldn’t charge, began turning on and off repetitively about every 2-5 minutes, and it kept saying something along the lines of “battery cannot be confirmed as an apple product”. So whatever battery is in my phone well .. idk wtf it is :|. Along with that when I brought it to Best Buy’s geek squad it was so far gone that the supervisor couldn’t really do much and since for some reason they seem to have thrown random parts together and made it somehow work for half a year, it also means that (at least at best buy through their connection with apple) they couldn’t find my phone/serial number in the system at all which meant I couldn’t even get a replacement which would’ve been fricken covered but now I have to go to apple directly and am going to have to pay for a replacement battery and gods know what else. :|

Update: I finally had my appt with apple and I thought it would maybe cost $150 max to replace the battery, ended up having to spend another $450 to just get an entirely new replacement phone instead. The battery still wouldn’t charge, and they said the wireless charger was so far gone and it was messed up somehow and that was what was causing the issue. I’m very suspicious though about how it all went down because I seriously mean it when I say it stopped working exactly 6 months after I bought it to the day 😭"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was really good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a quick and easy replacement for my son to get a phone quickly! Since he had to pay for the replacement the price was great for him also. The phone was in great condition when we got it packaged with a charger and a brand new cube . He also said that the screen protector that was on it was better than what he could buy in the store. We did buy a cover off of Amazon also. I was skeptical about buying a phone that was not provided by our carrier but everything actually turned out great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really pleased with this iPhone. It is in excellent condition and I am enjoying it very much. This is my first iPhone, so it took me awhile to get it set up like I want. I would definitely buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This being my first IPhone after 4 androids. Basically very happy with the performance of the processor and functions. Battery level rated at 80%, so that barely qualifies with the seller’s specs.
My only real issue is the screen is not an Apple replacement and the brightness is a problem.
All in all, I’m happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So I bought this thing and I have zero problems with it. It works 100%. I literally just booted everything up and it’s now working and everything seems to be in line and the only thing that I would recommend is that you look for the ones that are in excellent condition that’s the one I got here and it is amazing. I have zero problems with it. I would highly recommend anybody that is trying to get a new iPhone by the ones that are refurbished. They’re great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really nice phone. No scratches or problems. I’m happy with the purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Liked everything I received it was brand new and nothing wrong with for being a used phone and way better than my old phone lol."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Si está funcionando correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a bit hesitant to buy a phone from here, but it actually works great. The quality and battery life are amazing. Nothing wrong with the phone so far. I'm definitely glad I bought this phone. Much better than my last phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The face recognition doesn’t always work accurately that’s about it for the most part"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was advertised as excellent condition but the phone has a lot of scratches and dings on the sides. Though I like how the battery health is 100% and they included screen protector, phone case and charging block with cable. I wish it didn't have scratches though or should have advertised as good instead."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it’s hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it’s unlocked in packaging and on here… I began the activation process … and it wouldn’t not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It’s disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can’t even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It’s just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now it’s like I don’t want to even purchase phones from here anymore ! I’m really disappointed 🥺."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 So I bought the phone in excellent condition. I am dissapointed that the phone came with scratches on the screen .. this was discovered only because I removed the screen protector. It had a micro crack on the back glass and a noticeable dent on the top left. I wasn't expecting that because I bought the phone in excellent condition . Other than that the phone is working fine"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I have no complaints with this phone. It works like a dream. Battery life is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this phone it pretty much looked new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was an excellent product! More that I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Don’t know yet"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the purple iPhone 11 from Stone Digital despite the negative reviews since it was eligible for return. However, The phone exceeded my expectations! It has little to no cosmetic damage and came with a clear case and screen protector I wasn’t expecting. Activation of the phone was simple and easy- it was factory unlocked just as described. No problems with Apple ID, camera, etc. I waited about 2 weeks just to truly see how the phone operated and it has been up to par. No glitching or shutting down. The facial recognition works perfectly fine and the battery life has been amazing as well lasting about a full day with heavy use. The experience in how they packaged the product also made the phone feel brand new again instead of second hand."
"Apple","iPhone 11","everything looks good except the screen has some scuffs on it and the back camera is scratched. I bought 4 of these phone and 3/4 were perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product has good security features and the face recognition is super easy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is the second time I made a purchase with Avant. The iPhone 11 I purchased is Basically a brand new phone. The battery life is OK at 81% and that’s OK with me. The overall look and performance of the phone is truly outstanding. I plan to buy more phones with this company and I highly recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came packaged well, my daughter loves it. Seems to be working well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its sooooooooo pretty I can't even complain. Looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","In the features and details it was noted that the battery health would be a minimum of 80% but the battery health health came 77% not satisfied at all with this. However, The housing etc is great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone, reasonable price. Everything works!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good price for the phone. Just wish it had less scraches and better battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my phone in GREAT cosmetic condition and it works very well. Battery is also holding nicely - after over a month of using it! Great price, great product = very happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got it a couple days ago and so far I’ve had no issues. It has a few dings but other than that seems to work great. Good buy 👍🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. I have loved it and I thought it was the best purchase. However, yesterday my phone randomly crashed and it was at 50%. I turned it on and it was completely dead, but it was on. It said 0% remaining when I plugged it in and it was not seeming to charge. I went on settings and it told me that the battery in the phone is likely not compatible with this phone or it is not an actual apple battery. Now it can't go 2 minutes without crashing. I cannot even write this review on my phone because it will crash so I am using a computer. I would return the phone, but I cannot keep it on long enough to transfer my information to a new phone or to reset it. I am very disappointed and I do not know what to do. I would recommend buying straight from apple to ensure the phones reliability. Edit: I took it into best buy and I was told that the battery is not the issue, it failed all the tests and they did not replace it. I am not sure what the problem is. Maybe I just got a defective phone with my luck. I'm sure the other phones from this seller are reliable, I just had a bad experience. The customer service was great and they seemed very willing to help me out and assist in returns."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got exactly what I wanted. Easy to activate. No hardware or software problems. So happy I made this choice."
"Apple","iPhone 11","UPDATE: customer service way better than Amazon. New phone doesn’t seem to have any issues and they actually sent a charger.

This phone was supposed to be renewed in excellent condition and they didn’t even clean it. Worst there are scratches in the screen and back of the phone. Also, these phones are supposed to come with a charger and sim ejection tool. I just got the cord"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After four years of using an Android, I went back to the iPhone, since everyone else in my family is on iPhone and I didn't want to be the odd man out. So far, I'm liking the technology, and thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner that my Samsung had, but the facial recognition works really well. This phone does everything I need it to, and should be more durable than the last iphone I had. And buying it used and Amazon certified, the price was good, and for a reconditioned phone looks as good as a new one. So far so good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo está muy bien, pero la batería está un poco desgastada"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es impresionante que el producto pareciera totalmente nuevo, ni un solo rasguño, excelente calidad, y buen precio, quizá tuvimos suerte pero el producto es excelente,
El color le encantó a mi mamá, y el celular viene totalmente al 100%. Superó mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Unboxed, synced and everything seems to be working perfectly. Battery life is 84%. Beautiful phone with no immediate notice of exterior flaws. Perfectly boxed with charger, sim card remover, even included an inexpensive clear silicone cover until you could get a new one if desired and a tempered glass screen protector. The screen protector is cracked but wasn't expecting it so not disappointed. So far could not be more pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente teléfono, cambie del 6s Plus al 11 y es un salto cuya diferencia se nota bastante en cuanto a optimización, fluidez y experiencia de usuario. Estaba escéptico de comprar este teléfono por internet dados algunos reviews pero al final compré el iPhone 11 de 64 gb (unlocked) de BuySPRY y me llegó justo como lo pedí. Aunque el teléfono tiene algunos rayones en la pantalla no me quejo, funciona a la perfección."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is fine. The problem is the charger I received is faulty. It crackles when I plug it in and won’t charge the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looks good minimal scratches. Battery capacity at 88%. I just got it so we will see how it works. So far so good, the only reason I did 4 stars is due to the battery capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The one came in and it worked so that was good off the bat. There were a few scratches on the back and around the outside of the camera. The only thing I was disappointed in is the battery life is 81%, I know they are renewed but that definitely could be better"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It has been a good phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We bought the excellent condition one. It didn’t come for a while but I found it today. It had a scratch on the phones body. It was clearly visible from 12 inches away. It looks like it was hit against something. Everything works tho so we won’t be returning it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far this has exceeded my expectations. The phone seems brand new. It had a screen protector. Few minor scuffs on the corners, that’s not even noticeable. It was easy to set up. Process went as it should. Cameras both work. Battery seems to be pretty stable so far. I will update if anything changes but it came as described and works as it should."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone showed up packaged nicely, battery was charged and all I had to do is drop my SIM card in and allow it to update. All my apps transferred seamlessly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular venia funcionando bien. Solo con alguno golpes externos pero por lo demás al momento esta funcionando bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything seems like new except the 81% battery life. After a month, I can barely find any problems with it. However, the charger stopped working today."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo ok, la batería solo vino baja"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So I got this phone because I fell and shattered my old one, it arrived very quickly which was fantasy except I left for a trip the day before it arrived and therefor was not able to fully receive my package till I returned. Upon opening the package the box looked fine but the top R and bottom L corners of the phone have small cracks and the screen sits a little raised above the rest of the phone. Tried to process an exchange but would only give me the option to return but I can’t be without a phone sooooooo idk"
"Apple","iPhone 11","She loves it, it is an upgrade for her and she is so excited. No problems noted!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery a real plus, nice camera, screen. Easy to adapt to Apple phone from Android. Great to get a refurbished that was essentially a new phone. Review after two months' use. Added fast charger is worth the cost."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Service delivery was great and the time the phone arrived was earlier than expected...the phone works well n is in a good condition... Had some scratches but with a case it's perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life at 94% on arrival."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery is significantly Degraded. Never with refurbished phones have I had this issue"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was worthy! Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its a good phone but at like 78% battery life"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works perfectly and good price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have been team android since I can remember. I decided to try something new! Let me just say I love my iPhone. It’s perfect no marks or anything. It even came on day early. Everything works completely fine. This phone is def like new! Make the purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a great buy, it was like a new brand phone, no dings, no scratch and no dents ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life and poor charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this for my girlfriend and she still using it until I upgrade it to a iPhone 12 and she loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I tried several Trinidad and Tobago Sims and they did not work so I had to return. Otherwise phone was in good condition save for a few scratches on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the color and very clean look. Battery was a little lower than I’d usually like but nonissues with the phone so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice phone, arrived without any scars and the seller put tempered glass on the screen. I have been using it for a few weeks and it works great. Unfortunately I don't hit the lottery. Mine arrived with 85% battery. Well, that's to be expected for the price, but you know what, it lasts!!! 5 stars!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone works good overall. it’s just hard to hear talking on the phone without it on speaker. the camera isn’t as good as my boyfriends brand new Iphone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone shipped very fast and came in good packaging. The phone is in good condition, no visible scratches or cracks. The battery is at maximum capacity 90%, still lasts awhile. I would say it’s well worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","what took so long was for it to update"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm beginning to experience a few details with my phone. The battery seems chargeable up to 86%. Oh, and when I call and the call goes to voicemail my screen goes black, it freezes until the call hangs me up. I discovered that if I tap it I can unfreeze it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Las bocinas del cel para llamada se escuchan bajitas pero están bien para mi no me gustan los altos sonidos"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this phone in august and it has been working perfectly since the day I got it!!! Perfect condition, nearly perfect battery, and fast"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This pack was amazing. I love the iPhone and it was in excellent condition no scratches. Loved the purple color. Overall a great buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono en perfecto estado tal cual lo describía. No eh tenido ningún problema. Lo estoy usando en Argentina y nada de inconvenientes"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works greats. The physical blemishes are barely noticeable. I am debating whether or not to send it back because the listening speaker at the top of the phone is defective. The volume is super low and I can barely hear who is talking to me even when I have the volume at the max. I barely use this speaker when I make calls, I mostly put people on speaker phone or use headphones. So I’m deciding if I want the minor inconvenience of ordering a new one. Other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this refurbished at an excellent price. It looks brand new. The only problem is that the speaker for your ear was hard to hear. Now it doesn't work at all. I use earbuds most of the time so it isn't a problem. Beautiful color too 😍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not bad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","everything good especially camera"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i like this phone it’s basically as good as new there was a few nicks and scratches on the phone and air bubbles on the screen but it doesn’t really brother me to be honest everything else about the phone is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo que más me gustó es el excelente estado en el que vino, sin daños. El único aspecto es que la batería arribó en 84% lo cual se dice que está en los parámetros normales para cuando lo recibí y que la pantalla no puede verificarse."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got this for my dad he loves it only uses it for talk text and YouTube , overall a great affordable option for older parents who are not that text savvy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There's a bit of tingyness when the phone plays audio. Everything works except for the bottom left speaker."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter jumped on the Apple bandwagon. She's never owned an iPhone before, always Android. She loves the iPhone, says it's the best phone she's ever had."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this phone a couple months ago at most thinking it would be good. It’s already having problems with Face ID and actual screen. Hasn’t been dropped on ground or water and is acting like this. I have more than enough storage so it should be running smoothly but in reality it doesn’t. Swiping gets so slow at times and I can’t figure out why. This is my second phone like this, and I would recommend getting a new one"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Would like to get a renewed phone that has at least 90% battery health. In my opinion, it should have a newbattery replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As expected just wish the battery % was higher that 82. An overall good buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered excellent condition. But there are lot of visible scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Aside from a little tiny dent and the battery life being 82% at max capacity I think it’s pretty good! The charger that came with the phone is a little underwhelming tho."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was afraid to see negative comments but my phone arrived in perfect condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My son cracked his iPhone and I went to Best Buy to have it fixed but they said it would cost $400 to replace the whole phone. I got a better deal from this vendor and it even includes a charger! Would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nothing wrong with the product came earlier than expected very satisfied with this 😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter wanted an upgrade from her iPhone 8 Plus. So I got her this red iPhone 11 on here. So far, so good. Phone was in excellent condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is great! I switched from Samsung so it took a minute to acclimate to Apple but I love how simple it is. Everything works and looks like new.I’ve had this phone for months and there have been no problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My battery life came at 93 percent. It is better than the other refurbished phones I have had. No scratch on the surface at all. Perfect phone. Got the red t mobile version."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought an ""excellent condition"" phone, one speaker doesn't work and there is a chip on the screen. 84% battery life which it does state that this tier has 80%+ so I guess that's to be expected. Just highly disappointed about the speaker and the indent on the screen. Besides those two issues, everything else seems to fine so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Totally pleased with my new phone !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came veey fast, which i liked. Battery goes down very quick."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with no scratches but the battery health is only 78%. I wanted at least an 85% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone seems brand new the only problem I have with it is that it didn’t come with the color I ordered also the phone isn’t up to date when received and the battery life is very low"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Does have a bunch of dings on it almost too close to the screen. Would think lesser dings. Will update later how the performance is it’s a birthday gift so I can’t review just yet. Nice packaging."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is in perfect condition! Battery life is at 100!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Gifted to someone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","it had a little noise on the speaker so I return It. but the cellphone had the good condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 This is definitely worth the price, I bought this because I needed an iPhone for personal reasons and this is a complete steal! I think that for anyone who needs an iPhone is definitely going to get their bang for their buck. Already recommended this to others who were surprised by the price and more who thought it was fake and a rip off😒"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone it's great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall the phone is in good condition, came with 86% battery health
The only problem I seem to have is with the speakers that are muffled"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived on time and I was very nervous to see what was inside because I had bought an IPhone 11 from “BuySPRY” (that phone came with screen issues, scratches just an awful experience from that seller).

However I got the phone returned that decided to use “KANGA SUPPLY” instead. The phone was in perfect condition. It did not have any sign of previous use or any scratches. The battery life was at 88% which is ok for me.

It didn’t came with the original box or the original accessories but came with a generic charger.

Overall I was very pleased with the phone and I would highly recommend them."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived dead- no big deal but has multiple scratches on the screen which I was Not anticipating and not very pleased with."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is overall great, smooth and what I expected from a renewed phone but the charging port seems to be faulty it doesn’t charge properly as I will have to play with it before getting it to charge and pray it stays charging. Which I feel is a major issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was a Little skeptical since I’ve never ordered a used phone before! Everything is in perfect condition! I got this phone for my daughter it is her first phone ! She is in love with it! We realize it’s a hassle to sign up with local carriers and be on a contract , we prefer to buy a sim and a pre paid everything worked out and had no issues !! Battery life is a little low but don’t have to recharge at all through the day!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good as expected. Battery came with 85% of life condition. Very minimum scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","el disposito funciona bien en panama completamente desbloqueado, 87% de vida util de la bateria. excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life was just 86% :("
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am a 75 year old Grandmother that had a flight scheduled to see my grandchildren. Less than a week before my flight my phone decided to stop working. In a panic I contacted my daughter for help. She did research and suggested I buy a refurbished iPhone from Amazon. When ordering the phone I realized it could be shipped to arrive after my flight left. I emailed the customer service at Techlobby and explained my problem to them. Unbelievably I received a personal call from Morris at Techlobby and he gave me his personal promise that the phone had been tested and was in excellent working order and that he would see that it was shipped by 2nd Day Air so I could receive it the day before my flight. Morris did exactly as he promised and I had my terrific new phone before I flew to Texas.
Techlobby and Morris provided A+ customer service. I was and still am very impressed. Both with the phone and with the outstanding customer service.
Thank you Techlobby and Morris!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product was in amazing cosmetic condition, little to no visible scratches on the body. It looks and works like new. I would’ve given it five stars except it came carrier locked and I had to go about unlocking it myself. The seller was quite helpful and offered to replace the device. Overall it was a worthwhile purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m very happy with my purchase. My biggest concern was that the phone would not be trully unlocked but it actually was so I could use it right away by inserting my SIM card. It looks great, not a single scratch, basically new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buying renewed phones can be scary I was hesitant to buy but so far it’s working great and the seller went ahead and also put a screen protector on whic is perfectly installed no cracks or dents in phone the only thing I’m kinda unhappy with is that the battery health is at 85% would like to see it at 90 but hey…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Minor Scratches ,I paid for “excellent condition “ but it’s fine I’m really I love with the phone major upgrade from iphone8. Happy with my purchase !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It had a scratch on the side of the front face camera other than that it was good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was super skeptical because it is renewed but you would never know works just like a brand new phone I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Little scratch at the bottom. Battery life not bad. Slow internet sometimes. It worth the price though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tres semanas probando, 95% bien solo he encontrado una falla en el audífono cuando se recibe llamada, no es clara, distorsionada y cuando la paso al altavoz es súper clara. Lo demás hasta el momento muy bien. Estéticamente daré un 90%, traía un rayón que solo observándose bien se nota, traía el cristal protector; ya había leído todas las reviews, y dicen que cuando le ponen cristal es que está rayada la pantalla, es mínimo solo si lo revisas bien casi con lupa, lo puedes ver La batería venía en un 84% Dentro de todo va muy bien, y espero siga así por largo tiempo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just as new. Works like a charm!! Highly recommended with a case."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had issues with sound and eventually returned. Seller was understanding and communication was good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I liked that it came with everything and was in working condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was a great purchase, the product is fully functional and battery health is around 95%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s a great phone, but after dealing with my first one I bought on Amazon I’m still disappointed. I buy refurbished because it’s cheaper and better for the environment than buying brand new. With that said, I am struggling with the feeling now that I should have bought new! My first try on the iPhone 11 left me with a horrible battery and a scratchy screen. This one I hoped at least would have a 95% capacity for the battery. Instead it’s at 86%, so in the near future I’ll probably have to get a new battery for it. I’m starting to question whether it was worth it or not. It’s just frustrating because I had such a great experience buying my iPhone 6S on here. It should’ve been even better with such an upgrade!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the color Red, the iPhone 11 works well, the battery life is good, though I am used to the larger versions of the iPhones 6 plus, XS Max where the text size can be increased or decreased and everything is larger than life. The iPhone 11 has great videos takes wonderful pictures its everything an iPhone is all about. I give it a 8 out of 10 due to the size.... LOL"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in perfect condition -- the battery life was at 100% and no scratches anywhere. The call quality was as expected on both speaker phone and using the handset. It went through a full day's use and the battery only dropped to about 55%. Great seller experience with KANGA SUPPLY."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not the quality I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono llego en excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it and I’m literally writing my review using the phone I bought"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After about 1 month of use my screen just blacked out. I took that to the chin and took it upon myself to pay to get it replaced (literally on my birthday too). A couple of months later the battery just started acting up. If the phone processes too many apps then it'll force shut down and turn back on at 10%. It'll do this repeatedly too jumping from 10 to 50% it's ridiculous."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came perfectly packaged… it was compatible with boost mobile.. i just cant hear when i put my phone up to my ear to talk. Its like the speaker is water damaged"
"Apple","iPhone 11","UPDATE: vendor BHHT adjusted price/refund on scratched unit to allow for “acceptable” condition, not “good”, & is sending missing pwr adapters, so i can def rec this vendor. ORIGINAL: Bought 2 of these (“good” category) from vendor BHHT. The downside was that neither of the power adapters were included, as advertised, and one of them fits the “acceptable“ category description, much more so than the “good“ category description (re: scratched screen). The batteries came in at 84% and 85%, just above the minimum 80% described. Otherwise, the iPhone 11 is a great phone, and very similar to the current generation models. Will edit review if vendor responds positively to the missing adapters."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am very satisfied, it won me over"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received my phone was a little hesitant because people said their screens came cracked my was cracked but battery life was terrible it has a capacity of 75% which once it hits 80%should be replaced. Overall is good device just wish they were a little more truthful with battery capacity"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is in excellent condition - no detectable wear. Good packaging, that included charger and cable, screen protectors, and a SIM card tool. Fast shipping. Highly recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it as a gift for my little cousin, and she likes it. It was packaged well and came on time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect fit for me! The camera is great and the face recognition works surprisingly well. No complaints here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Super bien no ha dado problemas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery health at 77 . Phone looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good case for my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks like new but costs much less. Must buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The price may change overtime but I got this phone when it was about $350 which is a pretty good price for such 'modern' device. It works just fine. My only issue is that the charger port probably came in a bit defective since whenever I charge it doesn’t do well, but I can fix that. Great anyways!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is good but a few scratches l. Not surprised though because I got the good condition. Overall it is great and practically brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","You’ll have to put service on it so don’t think it’s comes with service, it cost $35 and some Change. At first I thought it wasn’t gonna work but it works just fine. It comes with a charger so you don’t have to worry about buying one, if you already have an iPhone just transfer your data to your new one. Go to your carrier and have them put service on the new phone. Log in using your iCloud and all your contacts and apps,notes etc will be on the new phone. Back and front camera works fine I got it within 2 days or ordering it. Once you set it up you’ll be straight oh and make sure to update it cause it may or may not be up to date. I did have a problem downloading stuff but that’s cause my old stuff was still transferring so give it a good hour or two to transfer over and do Face ID when they do you wanna do it. It makes downloading all your old apps easier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Value for money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works well, I was skeptical buying refurbished, very thankful it works!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono muy bonito. Lo mande a Peru para un familiar y me dice q hasta ahora todo súper bien. Esperemos y ojalá dure mucho"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Para ser un producto reacondicionado, es sorprendente el buen estado en el que se encuentra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone 8 developed a problem that was not going to get better so I made a decision to get a newer phone. The 90 day warranty through Amazon is what brought me back to their site to purchase another phone. The iPhone 11 I got is amazing. There was not a mark or scratch anywhere on it. The battery is in excellent shape. I can go up to 2 days without even charging it if I wanted to. From time of order to receiving phone was very good considering there was a 4th of July weekend holiday involved. Only difference is like many I miss the home button, but I’ll soldier on!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Im pretty impressed with how healthy this phone is, i expected much worse than 82%. The last refurbished iPhone i got only had 70% battery health. The facial recognition is perfect, the camera is great, and its a pretty mint color. It also came with a glass screen protector, which is pretty sweet."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this as a gift, and it was well received! I’m not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical, but it looks and works like a brand new phone. If you’re doubting, don’t :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Didn’t setup properly and entered infinite boot screen, solution for that is to fully shut it down and factory reset it through iTunesPc. If you need a decent phone for a good price this one is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased for granddaughter she loves the phone everything works, great camera and price for top of line IPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone looks like new and everything is good, but the battery helth is not very good for the maximal value just 85% compared to a new battery."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It looks good, but I am less lucky the battery is 83% only"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought from promo dealz, Phone arrived with a major deep hairline scratch on the screen and with Face ID not working. I ordered in excellent condition and was not given a device in excellent condition.Edit: I have since returned and bought from another seller: hybrid it. And it came in perfect condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular está en perfecto estado, no tenía detalles ni rayones pero Indicaban en la publicación que estaba desbloqueado y no era asi"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This refurbished phone was disappointing. The sound quality is terrible - it's scratchy and grating. And when trying to talk on the phone it's nearly impossible to hear the person at the other end."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I need to replace the battery soon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came early. Easy setup. 88% battery life. I love it. No scratches or dings. Phone works great. Only reason I’m giving 4 stars is because when I make calls, the speaker is a little staticky. But since I barely use the phone because I mostly text, it doesn’t bother me as much. Only when I am actually on the phone talking to someone that I get annoyed. Static isn’t there when on speakerphone.If it wasn’t for the static during phone calls, I would have gave 5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery health is 78%.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 has much better reception with Verizon which has been my carrier for 35 years. I purchased the 13 iPhone with the promotion and could not get a call out, or in. Within the 15 days I return the 13 iPhone and the iPhone 11 works just as well if not better for reception, and all the features. I’ve had four, five, 7/8, and upgraded to the 13. Big mistake the 13 iPhone has so many problems and issues. Thank you for the good phone that I have now, my renewed iPhone 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m other comments I seen people’s phone arrived broken or damaged but mine was perfectly fine! Nothings wrong with the phone, granted it does die a bit fast but the charger provided, fixes that right up. the only complaint I’d have is on the phone, near the bottom, for me at least, there was little text saying” product red”. yes I did get the red iPhone 11 but was not aware it came with that on the back. It’s not a really big deal for me, but it’s just a heads up! it’s nothing a phone case can’t cover lol, other then that the phone is perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in pretty good condition as stated in the order, I have been using it as my daily device for the past couple of weeks with no found issues. Phone was unlocked and ready to use right away and even came with included charger and block."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Phone works perfect Switched SIM cards and set up easily Only fault is the battery health. Description before buying says 80% at least. Mine has 78% overall 3.5 stars"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," Phone works perfect Switched SIM cards and set up easily Only fault is the battery health. Description before buying says 80% at least. Mine has 78% overall 3.5 stars"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came with a new charger, in perfect condition! No scratches, no glitches, no dents! It looks brand new and works like it’s brand new. I had no hassle switching my device with my carrier company. 10/10 recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works but I don’t think the parts is authentic"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product for the price, just wanted a better battery % but got 83% which is satisfactory"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buena calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego en perfecto estado, el único inconveniente fue que se demoro la entrega ya que nos trasladamos muy lejos para ir a retirar, pero todo lo demás excelente estado físico y software, me encantó"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works really well, no scratches looked like a brand new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone's battery health was at 84%, which wouldn't be terrible it the iPhone 11's battery life wasn't already rather poor. Aside from that, though, the refurbished unit I received was in really good condition. Happy with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 was in good overall condition. The problem is that the battery has to be replaced which is $69+tax. This iPhone 11 was not renewed as indicated. Advanced Solutions inaccurately described this product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","As advertised on all levels!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like promised; almost new. Came with charger, that little tool to take out the SIM card and a screen protector it also has few scratches but it’s okay. So far so good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone when I got it look just like new I would just if you get the iPhone 11 get the purple one it’s really pretty it’s like a lavender color so yes Anna has a good battery life even though the iPhone 13 came out the iPhone 11 if you don’t want to pay $$600 on the iPhone 13 get the iPhone 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The package and overall condition was very professional. The phone is in great condition, but the only caveat is the SIM card tray doesn’t exactly fit in the phone; so I can’t use it for calls yet. Outside of this hiccup, the product is high quality."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived within the time frame the seller stated. Looks great no scratches looked new. Battery life not sure yet it does last all day and I use my phone a lot. However I felt my Note 9 lasted longer.

When I received the phone I had some hurtles. I had Verizon and wanted to switch to ATT. I took it to Costco Kiosk and they had all sorts of issues. My options were return the phone or try taking it to ATT store. Communication with the seller was outstanding! I initially did it via Amazon chat and then I asked for a phone number. When I called I got a voicemail and though hmm they are not going to call back. But they did, the person who I spoke with was fantastic. ATT was able to transfer my service without a problem.

The morale of the story is don’t give up if it doesn’t work the 1st time. I am happy that I have an almost new phone with spending over $1000.

I highly recommend buying phones through this seller!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","IPhone 11 is in great condition. Only thing to know is that I does not have an original cable. Other than that, the phone is great, 89% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great buy, looks just like new, came with charging head, cable, clear case and even a screen protector. Have been using the phone for a couple of days and it hasn’t shown any defects, it also has a 90 day warranty. Very satisfied, would recommend to buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","• Swift delivery• Phone in great shape physically (perfect!) and system clean and ready to customize for myself• Great entry price for a new iphone user• Battery charge hold seems good. I do not have a comparison.• Would purchase again from this seller.Thanks!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone might as well be brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in good condition. Zero marks or scratches and ready to set up right out of the box. The price beat ATT’s refurb and others. The battery was at 87%.. I was hoping for 90% or higher but thats okay. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We are not sure if we will send it back. I did not come in any original packaging. Of course it said that sometimes it won't and this did not. Nor original charger. There is a noticeable scratch on the screen and the back has marks from a previous case - no big deal because we bought a case. This is for my daughter and she is just elated to have it so she doesn't want to send it back. Yet this is the 2nd phone we have purchased from Amazon renewed and this one is not in as good of condition. No where on the packaging does the guarantee which came in the packaging does it state that the phone must function at last at 90% of its battery capacity. At first use, the battery went to like 70 ish percent after a hour of use where we just tried to set the phone up. I tried to not buy this from the reseller called KISS, but Amazon didn't give me another option. Perhaps this particular reseller isn't that great. Not sure yet."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this product. Came with charger as well. Nothing wrong with the iPhone at all. Would buy again 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered the iPhone 11 64GB in Green for my mom as a birthday present. I noticed the iPhone was basically in perfect condition. Unfortunately the max battery capacity was 86%, which is expected for a renewed iPhone. I brought the device to Apple for an OEM battery replacement so I wouldn’t get the “unrecognized battery” from a 3rd party repair. Upon the repair the Apple technician noticed the Screen is “non-oem”. Making the original cost of a battery replacement $300 due to the “3rd party repair liability ”. Perhaps I miss-read the description, but I thought everything would basically be original or replaced with Apple Hardware."
"Apple","iPhone 11","so when I got this phone the touch screen didn't seem to be working and needed a hard reset to work (hold power button and then tap volume down once then volume up once), after this the phone was good and ran smooth (also had 100% battery health and there were no external flaws on the phone) except the touch screen stopped responding twice (in the middle of using it) and needed to be hard reset, so I decided to return it. I got my refund within 1-2 weeks after sending the postage out I believe. I reordered another one from these guys I got a 258 green 11 for $620 (unlocked too) which was only about 18 dollars more than what I had originally spent on the black 128 one. Anyways the new one came a few (I found 2) external flaws on the metal part of the phone, but they aren't super noticeable it didn't come with any cracks or anything just some worn out paint. Anyways the phone seems to be running great and has no problems, except for some reason it doesn't notify me when the battery is low, but for a $620 refurbished phone with 258 gb storage I think I can deal with that. Also I was hoping to get another 100% battery health on the new one and instead got 90%, which isn't horrible but I just miss having 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came with zero cosmetic imperfections and I was quite pleased about that. However, only one of the speakers on the bottom actually produces sound, and the earpiece is so quiet that I always have to put people on speaker during phone calls, or just use headphones. However, that isn’t so bad, the only major issue for me is the battery life, I can charge this phone all night before work and by the time I get off at 2, the battery is at 50%, and my job doesn’t allow me to have my phone on the floor so it drains that quickly just from being on standby. Im considering either getting a refund or maybe exchanging it for the same phone, just hoping the next one doesn’t have similar issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am extraordinarily impressed by the quality of this iPhone. There is one barely visible mark on the cusp of the glass back panel, but otherwise it is in perfect condition. The battery capacity is at 98% and it was mostly charged when it arrived to me. The screen protector arrived already installed on the screen, and came with a two-port charging block and lightening charger. It did not arrive in the original Apple box, but in an Amazon-brand box that was undamaged when it arrived. Highly recommend if you're looking to buy a new-ish iPhone for less than half market price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Much needed storage space!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived today, clean no scratches at all. Easy transfer from 7 to 11 in spite of me!!! So far everything works great. Worth the buy!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I loved almost everything about the phone it’s just there was one big problem when I got the phone there was an hardware problem going on with the phone, the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would not work which is my made use and when I got it check I was told after rebooting and hard resetting the phone that it’s a hardware problem and to get it fix would be a total amount of $399 so they basically really suggested me to get a whole new phone which really made me upset because I would have to wait to have a phone now because of this problem and I’m really in need of a phone at the time so it would effect me to wait for my refund to be buy a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought the I phone 11 black, came in looking brand new! The battery capacity is 84% which is not bad for the price. Upgraded from an i phone 7 and happy with my purchase!Update: It has been 2 months and the phone is still running great. The only problem I found was that the black paint by the charger port started chipping, I could easily take the paint off with my nail. I suggest getting a case right when you get it. But other than that its still great and has a great camera!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is very clean, but the battery percentage is 79%!!! That's very low!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","like every thing so for"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was really nervous with buying a phone on Amazon but I’m glad I did it has worked perfectly for me there were not scratches or anything and the battery last forever anyways that’s it I hope this helps just try it out if it doesn’t work than return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery health is at 85% when I got it not a big deal still hold a charge throughout the day. Phone runs smooth with issues everything works on it like it’s supposed to."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Only dislike from this Amazon certified renewed device is the screen had been replaced.The glass screen protector I installed out of the box does not adhere/seal properly near the top as a result.Also, The kit would benefit by including the sim card tray removal pin. I already had one from other phone. But this is a no brainer to include for 5 cents Amazon people.Otherwise, it seems to function well, has good battery life, and included short lightning cable and block"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is great. Battery capacity was at 86% when received. Easy to transfer iCloud from my old 7 plus to 11. Have to get used to no fingerprint reader and face recognition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just barely at 80% battery life, expected better"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Writing this on the new phone, packaging was great and took only 1 day to ship"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have to keep it on the charger all of the time, and it loses battery even if i’m not using it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my gf i was skeptical because it was such a good deal for the price and the storage space the phone came with. Came in perfect condition with no issues other then having to go through getting the sim activated"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome phone! Perfect condition!Thanks a bunch!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Takes great pics even in the dark"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I may never buy a new phone again. This is the 3rd time I've purchased a refurbished phone from Amazon and I've never been disappointed. One had a small, nearly noticeable scuff, but the other two were perfect. All functions work great and battery life is like new. No complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compre dudando pero estoy alegre me llegó con batería al 99%y un pequeño rayón en la pantalla,todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this I really recommend it’s like brand new almost and yeah 5/5 stars"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very easy to get set up with AT&T!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There is nothing physically or visually with this product, but it has a LOT of issues. For one, the “display” isn’t from apple so I am FOREVER getting notifications about an “unknown part”. Then there’s the fact that I was moving from a 128gb phone to this 128gb phone, but somehow I was “out of storage” before all of my stuff even transferred over? I also have to fully turn it off and back on multiple times a day because half of my stuff will disappear and half of my apps will just turn white and not work. I’m no tech expert, but I’m not doing anything THAT wrong so it has to be a phone issue. Returning this as soon as I can get one thru Verizon (which I was hoping to avoid, but you clearly do get what you paid for so I’m gonna have to bite the bullet). Genuinely disappointed this didn’t work out for me 😕"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So opened up the packet it was great but the life battery life is truly bad. So I’m getting it replaced."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My refurbished iPhone 11 arrived 3 days after I ordered it. It appeared new. No scratches/marks anywhere. Fantastic battery life! I am pleased with my purchase and whole heartedly recommend this company!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s just like many of the current iPhones with many the same features stays of the date and no finger ID but it does have Face ID, Make sure to get a Sim card for the provider you want this phone does not come with one and you’ll need it to get service"
"Apple","iPhone 11","👍👍👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I would recommend more people to buy refurbished phones once it comes like this one. The battery came at 94% and had no visible wear and tear. I would totally recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had this phone now for almost 2 years, It works amazing still and I got the 256gb because I’m someone who likes to take a lot of pictures so I need plenty of space on my phone for all my editing apps for my daily constant grading and honestly I have yet to use up all the space in my phone and it still runs perfectly smoothly. It had no damages it came in beautifully with official Apple charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I new it was a refurbished item, however I made my homework reading several reviews and the warranty from the seller.I meets all the expectations except for the bluetooth. It performs with a very poor connection with any kind of device, either audio or any other type; connection with get's dropped once and again at a short distance, less that a meter, so even my new generation headphones I had to be replaced by the old cord headphones from my old iPhone 7.For the rest it's ok, battery, camera, speakers, processing.If you don't mind to have this kind of issues for the price, then it's a good option, but if you cannot cope with it then do not risk your money and buy a new packaged item considering to pay in full."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I usually never do reviews, I just read them, but for the people wondering if this phone is a good purchase or not after reading these. I say step out on faith because it was most def a good purchase .I got the standard shipping ( cheaper ) & it was supposed to deliver a week later, but I received it the next day.The battery life was at 0% which is no big deal for me, I don't really trip about stuff like that.I expected it to not be in the original box & only have the charging cable, but I received it w/ a charging block as well & it wasn't in the original box. It was absolutely perfect as if nobody had used it.The camera is amazing, by far the best & cheap purchase . It took it a minute to transfer and update, but besides that it's been good.I was also concerned it about it not being unlocked fully as tho I seen several reviews that said their's wasn't, but mine definitely came unlocked. I'm very grateful for it & I'll be back with a week update ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente estado físico del celular, todo bien a excepción de la batería, condición de la batería al %87"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Same as new. I recommend this. They put a lot of effort into perfecting these phones. Me and my husband both got one and both said the same thing. His battery is 100% and mine is 99% thought. It can’t be more perfect than that."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased the iPhone 11 for my husband. He is not as computer literate as he once was and often has difficulty with his phone. I was a bit concerned about changing his phone (his last one was an iPhone 6). The phone arrived timely and was in good condition. Set up was very easy. It’s been a much easier transition than I expected. We watched a YouTube video to figure out how to operate without a home button. I would never have guessed that this was a refurbished phone. It’s as good as new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you! I was hesitant to buy a phone on line but you proved I made a great decision. Fast shipping was told by Friday was here on Wednesday. Perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I upgraded from the iPhone SE (2016).The renewed iPhone 11 from Amazon feels as good as new. I only noted a minor scratch near the charging port, however, I would barely have noticed this if I hadn't been looking.The software runs as smoothly as new.The battery life is excellent - it lasts me 2-3 days without charging.Touch screen has very good responsiveness.Overall, the renewed iPhone 11 from Amazon offers good value for money to a customer looking for most of the features of the latest iPhone without the expensive price tag."
"Apple","iPhone 11","In first place i was a little worried about getting a phone with scratches and some hardware malfunction, but it was really an excellent decision to buy this refurbished iPhone, it came like a brand new iphone and with 93% of battery life! Excellent seller and product!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recently started looking into getting my younger brother a new phone so we could keep in contact but unfortunately I couldn’t find a older model iPhone that wasn’t renewed for sale on Amazon so I decided to roll the dice and hopefully get a unsold warehouse phone but that unfortunately wasn’t the case here, when the phone came in the package the box had dirt and pine needles in it along with the phone that was wrapped in bubble wrap and laid on top of the charger cable. In the pictures show there were metal chips along the edges and buttons on the side and a clearly visible circle shown on the back of the phone along with the label put directly on it. I did not test the phone further because I already knew that it was unacceptable to give to my brother this phone in the condition it was in, I have requested a refund already and want to warn people of the risk that comes with ordering a renewed phone that is all I have for this review and I hope whoever reads this can make a more informed decision on their purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After almost 2 decades of using androids I finally decided to buy an iPhone. I didn't want to blow 1600 dollars on the iPhone 13 so I decided to buy an iPhone 11. its been 2 days and I'm somewhat still getting used to it but I will say that its looking to be one of the best phones I have ever had. This is a refurbished device and i did have some VERY light scratches on the screen but don't let that deter you away from getting one. All and all i am very satisfied with my first iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Keeps force restarting"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the product i bought from this seller. The product looks almost unused and well packaged as well.I really like that they included a good charger which is nice of them"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like everything about it ..no dislike"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had some thought and did some research buying a refurbished phone. The phone itself came in mint condition! No cracks or scratches. Works smoothly with no issues, good battery life. Just to verify! if you get an unlocked phone and have a hard time wonder why your SIM card is going through but says “no service”… before you get paranoid… (go to the settings…select general…. Select about…then scroll till you see carrier lock… it should say (NO SIM RESTRICTIONS).. that’s how you know it’s unlocked to any carrier. If your SIM does go through but it read’s it with no service you have to go to your carrier and have them switch the SIM card on to your new phone from your old device. You’re welcome! I very recommend, do your research before purchasing. Enjoy your day"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only thing I don't like is that the page says it's new when it really isn't, because the phone had some small marks on the sides like insignificant scratches but it had them and the battery life is at 89%, it really works perfect for what it costs on the page, which is 335 dollars, is fine if you compare it with the real price, it is between 600 and almost 700, so it is fine, I would just like them to clarify that on the page that they are not new and that people decide by reading that if they want to buy it or not"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just get it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came with minor scratche. Run good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Telephone basically"
"Apple","iPhone 11","NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT, JUST THAT I GOT MY SISTERS PHONE HAND DOWN INSTEAD. HAD TO RETURN IT AS I NEED THE FUNDS FOR SCHOOL."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compre como regalo de cumpleaños para mi hija, y excelente el producto, muy buen estado y Ella quedó muy contenta."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It got here OK. I just opened the package. That is all I know so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m satisfied with the condition of my iphone 11 256gb"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just wish the phone would’ve came with a little bit more battery life. I bought it a month ago with 88% battery life, and it’s already dropped down to 87%. Other reported theirs coming with 100%. But other than that it’s a great by in a pinch!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Iphone 11 fulfills its role very well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","In love with my new iPhone 11! Came in earlier than expected (3 days) when unboxed came with charger and SIM card removal tool. No scratches looks brand new like it was never used. No problem with it so far “fingers crossed” hope to still be using it in the year 2023 in great condition :) my bf will be buying one ASAP! Hope his comes in great condition as well! To be fully honest I was contemplating and worried about purchasing it at first because I read some of the reviews but I really needed a new phone since I still had the iPhone 8 and the Apple Store is too pricey lol <3"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone for my daughter. It had a few scratches on the screen but nothing major. It is refurbished so I can’t expect it to be perfect. So far the phone works with no problem."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I spent all together 388 with tax and everything. I’m very surprised by the quality. Only three things were off but it’s really not too important. Visible scratches around the back camera ring, it doesn’t harm the quality though. Another thing is that the Apple care was telling that the screen they repaired this phone with wasn’t a genuine Apple product, it looks fine and acts fine to me. And lastly a small crack in the screen but it’s nothing serious either. The battery life is 92% which is high compared to other phones I was looking at. Came with a charger and a SIM card pin. Overall great purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came early. Product came as described only problem was the battery life. 1-5 I give battery life a 3"
"Apple","iPhone 11","They have much better refurbished iPhone in good condition compare to another refurbished iPhone I got from BestBuy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","we are happy with this iPhone 11. It's nice that the phone came with a silicone case and protective glass. The only sad thing is that the glass was broken."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good product overall, had some moderate damage, more than I spected for the price. Face ID has given me some issues. But overall, good phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El dispositivo funciona bien, el único detalle es un rayón muy visible en la pantalla. Por lo menos con el protector de pantalla no se nota tanto. Por lo demás, todo excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The owner like, and appreciate your business."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great size iPhone! Battery lasts a long time and love the camera!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I understand that getting a used phone it won’t be perfect, but I would think that A refurbished phone would have a replaced battery. If I buy a phone and have to replace the battery, That’s an issue. For the cost of this used phone, it should’ve had a new battery."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone over all it works perfectly fine the battery health is 81 but besides that it a good phone it also came unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is in pristine condition; not a scratch to be found! Everything works perfectly without a hitch. I’m a very happy customer!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Description said:- This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple.- This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.By the photos you can see the screen is all scratched up and there's something like food or paint on the back - clearly this phone was not professionally cleaned and was not checked for cosmetic damage. Well, maybe if the lights were off.Maybe the person inspecting the phone put it in the wrong basket. Who knows. By the feedback and description I expected what was described. Clearly not an excellent condition device. It did power up and was otherwise functional, sure, hence 2 stars. I paid extra not to have to stare at a scratch every time I pick it up. Maybe they though the screen protector that was slapped on crookedly would mask it? Now I wait for my refund while I've already bought another 11 ""premium"" directly from Amazon. Your results may vary. Good luck."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I would not describe this phone to be in “excellent” condition. It has no scratches or blemishes on the outside, but has obvious signs of wear. The unit I received had a jammed volume down button. Speakers had dirt built up and sounded muffled. Also had tons of dirt built up in crevices around the camera. Quite gross. Battery showed 89% which is ok. IMO, a new iPhone 11 is well worth the extra 150 dollars."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone itself is in great condition. No scratches, no cracks. Only issue I see right now is the battery life is at 85% which doesn’t seem too bad but I feel like with an iPhone the battery turns to crap real fast. Definitely recommend though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No estaba desbloqueado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It keeps a very good condition, almost 90% new. No obvious scratches were found. The performance of the iPhone 11 is still very good and can handle most tasks for daily use. Just a good deal at this price tag."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Few days in. Haven’t had any problems so far and the phone was in near perfect condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My teenager loves the phone. It arrived with no discernible scratches, good condition, and worksgreat! This fall I will be purchasing a newer phone for myself, so this is definitely a seller I will checkout at that time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone functioned very well right out of the box. It loaded from my iPhone 6 automatically with virtually no losses. All passwords, all applications, and all phone numbers transferred simply by having the two phones close together.The only thing it did not transfer was message history. As simply kept my old cell phone to check those when I needed to.The touch screen is much more responsive than my old cell phone and much faster.The battery life is good. I do not use facial recognition.I would buy from this seller again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is good. Didn’t come damaged or cracked. Camera quality is great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Whenever the iphone is on battery save mode and I get a call, the screen won't turn on. I have to hang up and call back everytime. Got use to it, but was kinda dissapointed the iphone was not fully functional. If you are in US and have the possibility to return it, by all means buy it, if not, then have in mind that this sort of disperfections can happen to your order."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came in like new condition. No scratches or cracks of any sort. Works great with no issues. The battery function may not be great, but this is expected given that it is a used phone. This is a great way to avoid paying almost double the price for a new phone. Plus, you can get a less attractive color cheaper and then get a case for it of the color you like and it will totally cover the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that, it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llego en excelentes condiciones, desbloqueado y con la cantidad de memoria que pedí. Lo unico malo es que llego con 84% de batería pero fuera de eso y por su precio es un ganga!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had to return it. Battery health came at exactly 80%. at least the return was easy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone but the charger does not work and I don't know how to go about getting a replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llego en perfecto estado, batería 90% de condición y funciona perfectamente para argentina."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The entire phone is great. An authentic Apple device, no scratches or cracks on the screen, perfect cosmetic condition, perfect cameras, etc etc. However there are two very notable issues I discovered not long after acquiring this phoneFirst is the bottom speaker must have been replaced with a generic one, because it's quite low quality. Not enough to ruin the phone, but noticeably poor.Second is the battery. The phone arrived with an 89% battery health. A fair health that will last me a long time, but it's not 100%, meaning they did not bother replacing it which means I'm not going to experience 17 hour battery life as advertised. Very sadOther than that, the phone is surprisingly great. Expected much worse"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in excellent condition and very easy to set up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is perfect! It was truly in excellent condition. It was as if we bought it directly from the Apple Store. I'm so impressed! And to make it even better, the delivery came 4 days sooner than expected! Very happy with this purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There were 3 noticeable scratches on the back of the phone, which I don’t mind cuz I’m putting a case on. It did not come in the original apple box or come with the apple charger. The battery capacity was 90%. Other than that the screen looks like new, the face recognition and the camera works fine.It’s a refurbished phone so you get what you get. You won’t know the condition of the phone until you get it. I was looking for a relatively new phone for a cheaper price so I don’t mind with the phone I got, but if scratches and battery life are a concern for you, you might want to buy it from apple refurbished or just get a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compré para un amigo, el celular es muy lindo, no llegue a configurarlo ni nada porque fue un encargo pero no tenía ni un rasguño, Lucía como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought an iphone 11 and it came with a screen problem. 90% battery"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great shape. Came unlocked. I recommend it to all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great. Minor scratches on the edge of the camera. Battery life could be better but for the price it's good. A charger was provided but no SIM card ejector tool was included which is fine since I have plenty of them. The phone came with a screen protector pre installed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I did not use the Face recognition or fingerprint reader but I believe everything is working fine for me so far and I've only had my phone a few days..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fast delivery. Excellent product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The item came quickly. It came with a charger and was on 10% when it arrived - not a big deal. I noticed a couple of tiny scratches - again no big deal. The problem was that when I turned the phone on i could see a small white dot on the bottom right of the screen. When I looked this up it said that it could be caused by the battery pressed up against the screen and could not be repaired unless we replaced the screen and it could be due to an enlarged battery. Sounded like a red flag to me. Returning and going through another seller. Fingers crossed the next one is in better condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","when i ordered this phone everything was fine, till i went to go screenshot something and my power button was stuck, my phone wont even turn off, i have to wait till it turns off by itself, ill just sell it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived with completely dead battery. After several hours charging, battery health was 84%. No telling how fast the phone will die from here, but for a ""renewed"" phone, this feels like I overpaid for a phone that needs a new battery and will not last very long. I will return. Seller indicates a restocking fee. I will update on the return process. The phone came and was loose in the small mailing box. No extra padding to protect the phone. Phone arrived okay with no visible damage. Overall, it looks like this phone was rushed out the door to me, and has a bad or failing battery. I hope the return policy works, because this phone has a battery issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i was super anxious buying this phone since i’ve never bought a refurbished phone but after my 6s decided to not work properly i decided to just risk it and buy this phone. and it’s literally the best decision i’ve made. there are 0 scratches on the phone, the battery life is at 100%, camera and speakers work great, i literally love this phone. if i have to buy another i’ll most likely buy from this store again :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Can’t beat the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","amazing phone came in perfect condition of course there was some scratches on the end and what do you expect it is a used phone but the case i bought covers it so that matter."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono lo compré para mi esposa en condición excelente pero su batería resultó estar al 75 % sin contar que el pedido llegó retrasado y a una dirección incorrecta"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have no dislikes for this phone. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and I’m so happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I honestly was scared to purchase a phone online, but both my husband and I needed phones. It took me several days to make my mind about it. We decided and both my husband and I are enjoying our phones. The only problem is, is that my husband can't get his facial recognition to work, but it isn't a big issue for him, but as for me, my phone is totally fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like New! Works perfectly after I removed and replaced the screen protector, AWESOME PHONE - THANK YOU! Like new! Very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So excited I upgraded from se 2nd generation to this. Battery life is 86% but it still stays charged for the whole day . It was taking a minute to update so instead of transferring information from my last phone I just signed in with my iCloud then went to settings then transferred from there."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Well I have nothing but Good things to say about this product , great quality and battery last a good amount of time , they sent me a screen protector glass thing but it came cracked but it’s all good as long as the the phone was good condition . I want to say thanks and please keep sending out good quality phones like this because now I feel like if in the near future I need a other phone I’ll definitely come back to you guys so please keep it up and only send out great quality phones like this ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","bought this back in December. looks great, no major cosmetic problems. battery life isn’t perfect but I expected that. there is a little drag when it comes to the screen but not that bad. we probably could’ve returned it but waited too late so I just cut my losses. overall though it’s still doing good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had no problems with this phone it had tiny scratches on the screen that you had to look for, to notice. I would buy one again in a heartbeat. Buy this if you want a good phone for a good price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life is good, minor scratch and fully unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works perfectly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came 100% perfect. No scratches, bumps, etc. Very satisfied with my purchase. And I love the color!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Al inicio tenía miedo, pero llegó perfecto está en buenas condiciones. Lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We did not find the screen made well, cracks super easy. We are returning this item."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just received this phone today for my daughter and their are no scratches and everything went smoothly with transferring her old phone to that one but 3 hours later it started glitching. I tried to turn it off but it wouldn’t even do that. We tried for about 10 minutes then just gave up. When came back to it about 3 minutes later, it was fine. So I will be keeping a eye on it and let you know the updates tomorrow"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the phone but was dead when got it and had a light scratch on lense"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very pleased from a previous Android loving girl."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was purchased to replace a newer phone with a severely damaged screen. Simply moving the sim card from the previous phone was all it took to start working, all data transferred quickly without issue. Cameras and all functions including face recognition work fine, battery life good although it has dropped slightly over time. Meets our needs at a far lower price than a new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this for my mom and she hasn’t complained about issues with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Work good, nice!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks brand new, and even comes with a screen protector. Only thing was it had sticky stuff in the back and was kinda dirty but it’s an easy fix."
"Apple","iPhone 11","there was a scratch but it wasn't that noitcable and also there was no sim tray injector so I had a hard time pulling the tray scared of damaging it and i thought since other people had on that there would be a screen protector on it and the battery came at like 70% i thought i would be fullly charged."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As soon as I opened my phone, I had continuous notifications about how degraded the battery life is. That is literally the only reason I bought a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wish I could provide pictures, but the phones works good. It did not come updated so you'll have to update it before adding your icloud account to it. No scratches or anything on the front or back. Only thing is around the back camera lenses and charging port there are little scrapes which is expected from a renewed phone honestly. The scrapes aren't bad tho."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product works really great! Great price for what I was looking for as well! Same color I wanted and gigabyte size was OK. Are use a service called Wing Alpha. It’s based off AT&T towers and this phone works great with their service. No complaints here! Would definitely re-purchase again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about buying an iPhone off Amazon but so far it has turned out to be a great buy. I have transferred all my data from the iPhone 6 to the new iPhone 11 with no problems. It has been a very smooth process. I would recommend this phone to anyone. Plus, the seller was easy to reach by email and very responsive."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone I received was just as they promoted with screen and overall appereance of the phone, but I see why someone give it up. First, the battery went down from 80% to 78% life in 11 days, even though I don't use my phone more than 3-4 hours a day, which the same phone recognizes my habits do not damage the battery. Second, the phone is just overall defective, it will randomly stop working with the touch and screen and click letters or just freeze the screen, it doesn't matter if I clean the screen or my hands, at least 10 times a day I will have a problem writing a message, going through instagram or just overall using the phone.I have contacted the company and I hope to get a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente estado y presentación. Tal como fue descrito."
"Apple","iPhone 11","works perfectly. The only thing is that it have little scratches, but It have scratches, but it’s almost impossible to see them. The battery life is at 88 so I’m ok with that"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased this for my 9 year old and he is content. The phone came as described(looks great) facial recognition works well and I haven’t noticed any issues in the 30 days that he’s had it. I’m pleased with the purchase and price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received my order today. Happy with the purchase. Battery health at 82%. Everything seems to be working as intended."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I hate upgrading when every new iphone is sold for crazy prices. I just wanted to find something new within my price range. I was definitely taking a chance by purchasing the phone refurbished but it was definitely worth it. Would really recommend especially because if for whatever reason you are not satisfied with your product you can return it and get a replacement or a guaranteed refund through amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just wanted to say this phone is perfect I was very scared buying it at the end of the day I was proven wrong. You diggg and the phone came with 100% battery life😌. Thank you so much I’m loving it. The face recognition was perfect I mean everything works perfectly and my phone was unlocked. Got my new SIM card and put it in working perfectly. And men the audio is too fire. I recommend that y’all buy from this seller and don’t follow your instincts because I was proven wrong and I hope they keep it up. all the bottoms the audio bottom works perfectly so is the power bottom. Just updated my phone and it works smoothly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was everything I expected only a few light scratches great battery health easy set up"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the size of the phone and the color."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Upgrading from iPhone-6S+, lots of features to get use to, but over-all very happy with purchase. Especially like to face recognition feature so now I don't have to repeatedly enter my pass code. The phone came very clean and with no imperfections that can be seen with the naked eye."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's a great phone but I gave it 4 stars because it came with a scratch on the screen and there is no fingerprint reader."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought an 11 from Hybrid IT because of their ratings/reviews. There was a hiccup in my order but their customer service was on it very quick. They were friendly and helpful, which I really appreciated. They got it all worked out and left me a happy camper with a beautiful refurbished phone that I probably couldn’t tell apart from a brand new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen was glitchy. Probably refurbished with a third party screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve loved using this phone! Going from an iPhone 7, with poor battery life, to an iPhone 11 has been a major difference for the better. I had to google how to do a couple things since there’s no fingerprint button anymore, but other than that I’m loving it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","IPhone 11 128GB unlocked. Phone itself in a good condition, I am very glad. It's pity that batter capacity at 82%, not exactly what I expected."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was delivered on time in an excellent condition, battery is at 90% but all other components are in perfect shape"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in great physical condition and almost looked brand new. However, battery life did not exceed 80% as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Definitely worth getting comes fast, haven’t had any problems😁😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","packaging sucks doesnt feel anything like the orginal unboxing from apple but the phone itself had no scratches and it turn on and it looks brand new honestly i feel like the phone should have been more expensive but im not complaining"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Estamos a unos días probándolo y no ha dado problema"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my new phone so much and I am so glad that I bought it. I really do feel that I needed an upgrade and this was just the upgrade I needed! It’s a reasonable price with great quality and it really was worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is awesome except the messages are not working. Talked to Apple and my carrier and they both said I would have return the phone :( Was happy with everything else. The return process is easy so thankful for that!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Celular en un muy buen estado batería al 90% no está mal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","el producto vino como nuevo en apariencia pero vino con menos del 80% de la batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like it because it was delievered on schedule,I am disappointed it because the entire package not include the attachment as the Apple packagesuch as no earphone, no ubs charge."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good value"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. I’m assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they don’t replace the batteries either. I’m a little disappointed with my experience because I’ve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more “new” like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only complaint I have is the battery power drain. I wanted a longer battery support."
"Apple","iPhone 11","01 equipo llego sin cargador y el otro si , uno llego un poco mas con detalles esteticos"
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone came fast and undamaged"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came faster than expected! Only thing is it didn’t come with a sim ejector tool, so be aware of that."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in good condition. The only mark I could find was at the very bottom of the screen. It had a very small scratch that is mostly on the bezel not the screen. That's the only reason I didn't mind it. The battery health was 89% which is pretty good. It works great so far. No issues here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with a screen protector on it, 75% battery, and ready to be set up! It was a very good buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen has a scuff but its not much visible plus there are small chips on the bottom and the top of the housing close to front area which both are visible from 12 inches away. Back glass may have been replaced there are dirts between the housing and the glass.I attached some picturesBattery life is as promised over 80%.I do not know if its water proof but I do not want to test it since there is a warning saying ""its not guaranteed as waterproof for renewed phones"".I will still keep it and give it a month or so to see if it gives me some issues then I will decide since I have 3 months return policy with Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Would not work with sprint service"
"Apple","iPhone 11","so far it works perfectly. I'm thrilled with this. Photos are great quality."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was good, a little scratch at the top but other than that it was great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone was unlocked and in good condition plus it came with a screen protector on it I’m satisfied with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","la batería llego al 92% funciona en Paraguay."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came fully unlocked was able to put SIM card in with no problem, in perfect condition. There are little things that are wrong but it might be a settings thing . But overall great price for great phone so far !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i like it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bueno producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo funcionó excelente. El único fallo que traía era que cuando se Le sube mucho el volumen se distorsióna el sonido por eso no Le doy las 5 estrellas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Would’ve been5 stars if it was carrierunlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like it a lot i bought it for my wife she is soo happy thanks for sending it fast right on time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered another iPhone 11. I love it. But I never received this specific one. It’s a good phone, especially since it does not break the bank too much compared to the newer models. So my rating is based on the phone in general, not this specific one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","my phone says apple parts were not used to refurbish and I may have problems"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is a rebuilt item that claims to be new and is fine in appearance and functionality but it only lasted 5 months. I told the provider about this and he did not reply. Be careful buying in this store as there is a risk of losing your money. I have bought about 50 items in the year on Amazon which makes me a good buyer and this supplier is the only one who did not offer me anything in return"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Impossible to believe that this was not a new phone. Very clean, looks like it was never used. They did a beautiful job! I've only used it for a day, so I may say something later, but for now I can say that I'm extremely pleased. This was a very fairly priced phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Recibí el teléfono en perfectas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","quick delivery and great quality . soo far soo good I am still learning came with a screen protector so didn't need to buy one..would have been nice to know."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the wall charger doesn't work. for that reason I give 3 Star"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone is gorgeous and it comes with a screen protector! sadly the battery life is only at 80% and the speakers are completely blown out. i saw reviews about how the battery life was at 100% and all of that. also my speaker the play music out loud barely works and sounds crappy. im not going to return it, far too much hassle, im just a bit disappointed. so fair warning: the speaker might be blown out and the battery wont be like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything else looks good but for some reason there is a problem in speaker of the phone. When somebody calls, it don’t ring up nicely. I can barely listen the sound. When someone is calling , I can’t be able to hear it because it doesn’t produce sound. I did everything that needs to be done but still something is wrong. Is there anyway I am missing or anything that helps me solve the problems. Like I said, i tried everything and yet couldn’t solve the issue. Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived today. Almost flawless. Minor scuff on one of the top corners. A little concerned that the Battery life was at 87% capacity. Other than that , it was easy to get my service switched to this device. I did it myself online. Love that it came with a screen protector already installed on the device."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Teléfono en perfecto estado pero vino con la batería con 80% de vida útil"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m usually hesitant to purchase previously owned iPhones due to the multitude of the theft that occur on a regular basis with these devices. This experience has been an absolute breeze start to finish. Small hiccup upon receipt of the phones but they got it resolved very quick & now I have an extremely happy daughter with an upgraded phone! Will consider purchase in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","WHAT CAN I SAY OTHER THAN THIS PHONE LOOKS AND PREFORMES LIKE BRAND NEW. THE BATTERY HEALTH 96%. PUT MY STRAIGHT TALK SIMS IN AND IT CONNECTED IMMEDIATELY. TOTALLTY UNLOCKED. THE PHONE EVEN CAME WITH A SCREEN PROTECTOR INSTALLED. THANK YOU BUYSPRY FOR A GREAT PHONE AND A GREAT PRICE."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice product, well renewed… recommend the seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It gets 2 stars because the phone works but otherwise it couldn’t be much worse. First off, I ordered the green phone and reviewed a black phone (didn’t want to deal with returning and waiting 5 days for a new one). Also, it had a 3rd party new screen on it that stopped Face ID from happening and left a consistent message in the settings about it and the battery health was at 82%. Pretty pathetic across the board. I know it’s “renewed” but with such ambiguity with that term (renewed may just mean it was a returned item) I excepted a higher quality phone than one I could by used off Facebook for less money. Only buy if you want to use it for a trade in with your provider"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was the perfect size and color I wanted no scratches or marks came with a charger and a sim card pin great and love it would defiantly buy again for the price!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's like new, economic and it came with a charger too! It was a perfect b-day present 🎁 👌"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is in a excellent condition. And for that price I couldn’t asked for more. It didn’t come in the original box but that’s fine for me. The phone looks brand new and everything works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","100% battery :D also is in very good and clean condition! Amazing!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Estaba un poco rayado, lo importante es que funciona bien.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Súper es un teléfono prácticamente nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was not an entirely as purchase my only issue is sometimes the screen jumps. It’s not very often but I’ve noticed or a few times. Also there is this weird thing that happens when I try to record videos with audio. There is this sound that overpowers the real time audio and it makes it difficult when recording. Other than that there were no noticeable scrapes on the phone. It came packaged well with a charger and set up was easy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything worked out great. Received item as advertised and in good working condition. Very happy with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was almost brand new and the only thing missing was the original packaging but other than that it was the best money I’ve spent on a phone in a long time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought 2 phones, one only had a scratch and works fine, the other ones ear speaker didn’t work at all had them send in a replacement but when I opened the box it has a lot of scratches on top and on the screen very disappointed after spending this much money on a phone…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","buen articulo, sin ninguna raya, como nuevo, trajo protector de pantalla y un forro negro, vino en una caja resistente y como decía en la descripción incluye un cargador genérico nuevo, la batería funciona muy bien hasta los momentos no tengo nada negativo que decir. articulo recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was ok but no box and original charger. It also had a couple scratches on the screen and back. It was ok but i expected a phone with a better condition according to the description."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone was good, battery health was exactly 88% though stated 80% and above. in all the phone looks great, with no scratches on the screen or the body of the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","To anyone skeptical: be a little less. The phone itself was in perfect condition. faceID works flawlessly. Truthfully, I cannot find one scratch or blemish. The only thing I wish was just a little better is the battery health, which came in at 89%. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this product or seller enough"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m in Jamaica and i was very skeptical about buying this phone after reading some of the reviews, I almost changed my mind. But i still went ahead and its pretty good, its in good condition (8/12/10) and it works good.. only thing I’m kinda disappointed about is that the battery % came at 79% and it has a small crack on the back at the bottom and on the side near the camera. Im mostly disappointed about the battery percentage .. but even tho its 79% it still last for a good time.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Update: After several days of back and forth with the seller refusing to replace the device I finally had to call Amazon Customer service to have them issue a return label because the seller refused to do anything to make it right.BUYER BEWARE!!!My moms old iPhone 6S is dying and she desperately needed a new phone and can’t afford to buy one.She does a lot for us like watching our kids during the week while we are at work and we wanted to bless her with a “new” phone.I contacted the seller in advance to make sure it would arrive in time for her birthday party.I placed the order last week and the item arrived today. As soon as I picked it up from FEDEX and got it back in my office to test it out I immediately noticed light coming from the right side of the phone. There is a huge gap between the display and the frame. You can fit a penny between them.The display itself is not cracked and the packaging is just fine so it didn’t happen in transit and was sent to us in this condition.Nobody checked the device before it was shipped out because it’s immediately obvious when you pick it up to use it.Her birthday party is on Friday and here we are on Wednesday with a broken phone.We called Amazon and they said the seller has until next Monday to reply to our request for a replacement. Hopefully we hear from them before then with a resolution.We are really sad because she deserves something nice and now we are waiting on the seller to make it right."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The charger is not original and the battery less 87 %"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Condiciones estéticas bastante dañadas y la vida útil de la batería bajo rendimiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11","excelente equipo con una camara y funciones espectaculares"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great, no problems came brand new. Didn’t come with a box and the charger that it did come in with didn’t work. Also, didn’t have a SIM card or the thingy to take the little tab out but I used a paper clip and that worked just fine. Tbh it’s a good phone nothing bad to say about it. Good condition connected nicely backed everything up and it was good to go. I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","For the price, I have to admit, its probably worth it, but some aspects of the phone have really let me down. The screen is very scratched up and theres a crack in the middle of the screen. A big reason I wanted to give up my current phone was due to the battery life (which is at 83% atm), but what I've purchased is actually lower than that (82%) so now I'm questioning is this is even a purchase worth making."
"Apple","iPhone 11","crackling sound , specially during call"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in good shape except for the scrapes on the screen on the right hand side. It is very noticeable. Obviously this is a refurbished phone but cosmetic issues like this shouldn’t pass quality control. The rest of the phone works perfectly but the scratches make my screen look permanently smudged."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It keeps notifying that I have an unknown part in display, and from what my research tells me, this can cause some minor problems. Also, FaceID doesn’t work, which means I have to unlock the phone manually (which isn’t a problem but it can slow down my actions a bit). And I’ve had other problems where I have to keep restarting the phone to help get it back to normal. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before. Unless you can find and afford someone to help you fix these, then please beware of your purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono esta un poco rayado, pero creo que esta bien para su precio, soy de Ecuador y el celular esta completamente desbloqueado para mi país 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone so much . Everything works perfectly fine. It’s totally a big upgrade from my iPhone 7+ I been having for 5 years"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought one and it works majority of the time but has glitches were the phone will restart itself since I received it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works good but I'm disappointed with the battery life. It should exceed 80% but mine says 79%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don’t usually write reviews but this time, I was really impressed, so here it is . Phone is basically new . I got the red version and couldn’t stop looking at it . Face ID , camera and everything works perfectly . Fantastic stuff !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is perfect basically like buying it new. Comes with a charger and phone and that's it. Recommend buying a screen protector and case separately (since it's not included) so that it all comes together and you'll be ready to go"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product as described. Not a scratch on it. Works perfectly…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me pareció muy bueno el producto llevo 4 meses usándolo y no he tenido ningún tipo de problema, en estética le doy un 10/10. Es justo lo que buscaba :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Am supper happy I got this product even tho it's a bit scratched up on the sides. The battery life is was 100% made it mush nicer..... Thanks again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I prefer the button because the swiping does not work well. It’s okay"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There's a scratch on the screen but you won't notice it, and my daughter loves it. I was concerned about the battery life but it's fine, good as new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iphone is amazing battery 100% and fully unblocked works good in latin america."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just what I ordered A+"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I liked the size and price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the phone on January 13th. I have been using it for a couple weeks, so that it could run the battery performance check. Once completed it is now showing that my battery health is at 87% of maximum capacity. It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand it’s a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine. Issues with swiping up to get to Home Screen, odd lock-up’s and having to close apps, issues with facial unlock, etc... Semi-minor things such as that. I gave it 3 stars because it’s running okay (possibly even as expected), but the battery is rather concerning, as that’s the reason I upgraded to a new model in the first place."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was a little skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but after reading the reviews I thought “ok I’ll try it”. So happy I did. It was so easy to set up and transfer from my old phone (IPhone 6). Love this phone😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in a good condition. No issues. Works perfectly fine. No issues with camera quality, speakers or mic. Came with a screen protector already installed and the Apple charger cord (and an off brand block). Overall great product. Would recommend to a friend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone but my speaker is super low especially my alarms when they go off."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good value for the money. Clean and in nearly perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought the iPhone 11 for my wife and she loves it. She’s getting use to the new features and battery life is way above and beyond what other phones she’s had."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was a gift for my brother-in-law in Argentina and it works perfectly so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s nice until it isn’t. Honestly in great condition but apple has me on edge."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition works great and the battery life is good. Lasts for over 24 hours!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","pretty good came in a android box though"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone and it was everything is going smoothly until the next day is shut off randomly when it was fully at 70% so they were definitely something wrong I waited days for the show back on and I never turn back on so I called Amazon Apple they weren’t much help and I just waited and it turned back on but ever since then same things were happening but I can’t do anything about it months past and it literally started having such a bad glitch and changing colors till it was unbearably hard to even turn on so I returned it and still haven’t got my money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was working fine battery life was more than anticipated at 96 instead of the advertised 85-90 I believe, but after about 40 days the phone would restart like it had no battery left even though it was at 100% or while it was charging. Everything else was fine and id probably still buy another phone from the company."
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone is ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agradó la condición de batería. Esperaba algo mejor. Mi selección de pago fue en condición excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recently purchased this renewed iPhone 11. Let’s just say everything works great! And the battery was still at 75% after 24 hrs…….very good awesome in fact…If you are looking for a phone replacement and you don’t want to pay new prices this seller deserves your business…."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came quickly and was in perfect shape. We had no problem getting it set up with T moble."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with 88% battery maximum capacity for battery health, but otherwise the phone is like new for what it is! There are a couple little scratches that are barely noticeable, but other than that it’s in great condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Está bien, cumple su función"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The first refurbished IPhone 11 arrive and it was in great shape. However, reception was poor and after two weeks the antenna failed. I returned it for a refund and ordered another phone. The new phone arrived today and I found that the battery life was at 82%. Apple recommends replacing the battery when it gets to 80%—a $100.00 charge. I am really unhappy with my overall experience and I expected better from Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works perfectly! There are no scratches. I was expecting more out of the battery life but it is still great. All functions are perfect and I am very very happy with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen got a lot of scratches if you look Closely.It came with a screen protector to hide the scratches and when I took of the screen protector it was kinda hard to clean up and it got a glue like material."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this item and was skeptical afterwards if it would meet my expectations but honestly it does!!!! I'm so happy I took the risk I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend to anyone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Best phone I’ve bought from Amazon I’ve gotten a couple off of Amazon. Here’s a picture from the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect phone for my pre-teen! Headed off to middle school in style of course! Phone does come in a box but I did have to purchase an IPhone box on eBay to look legit.Comes with charger/charger box but it’s not from apple.No signs of it being refurbished.Absolutely no complaints!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The outside of the phone looks great, basically brand new. However, I was super disappointed to see the maximum capacity of the battery is 78%, and when I checked the battery health it says “Service” and says the battery needs to be replaced. The description states it won’t be less than 80%. I’ve contacted the seller but I haven’t heard back yet.Update - Seller offered a $25 credit towards a battery replacement or to return the phone. They were pretty quick to respond."
"Apple","iPhone 11","good quality, works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sometimes it freezes but It might be because I try to move at the speed of light haha"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in a very good condition only have a small scratch at the back thats barely noticeable...ordered a few months back and I haven't had any issues with it so far. Battery life was definitely what they advertised"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this phone. It is still top of the line even thought newer one are out. The right combo of quality and price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","/220527
iPhøne 11 256GB $450
Excellent value like new. Impressive on all counts.
Unit looked perfect with no visible scratches or blemishes & battery 93%. (vs 80% min)
Used Apple iCloud and apple new phone transfer protocol to transfer all data from old iPhone 7 128 GB.
all went perfect took ~3 days for all data to transfer but phone menus etc now look exactly as they were on previous phone. Highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly, after reading the reviews the good outweighed the bad. The phone is in excellent condition!!! I ordered the red iPhone 11 and I had no scratches and the battery health is 100%. Everything works very good. It is basically new. I’m so excited because I saved more money than buying one on the Apple store. Also, they shipped it very quickly. So go and purchase your phone today !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it. Great item works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works perfect love it for the price!!!♥️"

"Apple","iPhone 11","My grand daughter was here visiting this summer and she needed a different phone, so we looked on amazon and she found what she wanted. She said it was like a new phone. Thanks again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I hesitated to buy a renewed phone, but read the reviews and gave it a shot. I’m glad I did! Excellent quality, works well (once I got past the learning curve, being a longtime android user) and it’s faster than any of my other phones by a long shot. I paid half of retail for “new,” and got an excellent phone with strong battery life to boot. This seller knows what they’re doing and does it well!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó como nuevo , todo Perfecto hasta ahora"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received product in excellent condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Expected less damage"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my grandson( iphone 11) cause he was the only one who didn't have one, lol,the phone was in nearly perfect condition, it had one small scratch on the screen but nothing to get upset about, mt grandson is 15 so i'm sure it will accumulate a few more scratches, he's pretty active n clumsy. He's happy so i'm happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall phone performance is pretty good. This was a great purchase. It was a gift for my daughter."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great, no issues so far. I am happy with my purchase so I recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s literally like a new phone mine came in perfect shape with a block and a charger my phone didn’t come at 100% but it still charges good and stays a long time I love it didn’t have no trouble at all setting it up I got the black iPhone no scratches but this phone don’t listen to the other reviews it’s the best it didn’t come with a iPhone box but it’s still good and came 3 days early"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Well the batter health is 85% not good not bad and the camera is bad idk what’s wrong with it the quality looks horrible it came with a charging brick thwt heated up so fast so I used my old one but it’s a good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recently got this phone. It wasDelivered one day early and it looks like new. It only has one scratch ( tiny). Comes with a screen protector. It is definitely a win"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Been using this phone for 3 months now and is going great! I had one issue with the battery life so I reached out to the seller and they covered the cost of getting a replacement battery! Very satisfied with their service and the iPhone 11 has been great since!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little nervous getting this product after seeing the reviews.. but honestly not everyone will get the same phone some may come with scratches others may have defaults but the phone I just received works (GREAT so far ) battery life is good it does last , the Face ID works fine , setting up the phone itself was VERY easy and the phone was unlocked so all I had to do was transfer my SIM card and now I’m able to do everything on it . I’ll update in a few months"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone itself works fine but this scratch on the bottom right corner of the frame and screen is a bit rough on the palm of my hand."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone never really worked well (wouldn't install apps, face recognition worked for maybe a week, got a message saying it wasn't an authentic interface... so I wonder if I got scammed and this wasn't even a real iphone) and it had microfractures - fell off the arm of my couch onto carpeted floor (while in protective case with screen protector!) and the back totally cracked. Sent it back and the restocking fee was $574.19 on the purchase price of $579.99.There was an issue getting the Apple ID disassociated with the phone, but after that, the seller did go ahead and refund the rest of the phone price. I wish communication would have been clearer, since I initially thought the restocking fee was almost the price of the phone (that's how it came through) and I was very frustrated about that. I'm grateful it was eventually refunded since phones (especially iphones) are pricey."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I called my iPhone 6 my “smarter than me phone”, this one is so far above me, thank God I have a 14 & 22 year old grandsons who can figure it out."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m pleasantly surprised with this transaction. I’m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase. The phone doesn’t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash. With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised. It stared right up and went through start up process. My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way. I’ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc). I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it’s supposed to be. If you’re concerned about packaging and having a “uniquely” Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great! Saved 150 buying this phone here rather then new. Also unlocked and works with Boost Mobile!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me encanto! Llego con su cargador y en muy buenas condiciones, sin una raya ni nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The device came in excellent condition, no defect or damage and delivery was super fast!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sin problema alguno todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fantastic phone on brand new condition for a lot less money!Battery is fantastic"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the phone with the battery at 87 percent battery health. It also came with scratches on the back. The camera was also a bit scratched. You get what you paid for though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Used for about 2 years, everything works great! maybe the battery lost its life a little bit, but still can use it for one day after fully charged. I decide to never buy the new product now since its not great deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esta muy bonito"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono viene como nuevo, únicamente trae cable cargador (compatible) totalmente desbloqueado 👏🏼👏🏼"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had gotten this phone because my old phone began to get a little laggy and it works perfectly. I’ve had it for more than a year now and I’ve never had a problem with it. It does come with a charger but it doesn’t come with headphones which was expected. Battery life is really good too, it can last me a full day. I would reccommend this to everyone who’s thinking about getting it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So much for renewed.. did not expect to get a badly scuffed up screwn"
"Apple","iPhone 11","everything works fine just battery health not full but its ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone come exactly how they said it would it got here a day early it is in great condition and I am very satisfied with the product that I got"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I needed an unlocked iPhone because my iPhone 6 was memory full at 64 gb. Saw this refurbished iPhone 11 with 256 gb for under $500 so a great price. LOVE the face recognition and it has a great camera. Runs much faster than my old phone and the battery lasts much longer between charges. Like the light purple also so I got a clear protective case."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Has yet to disappoint, very satisfied with product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When on a call, muffled/low and crackling sound when listening - cannot adjust to make louder."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exactly like buying one new from Apple had no issues whatsoever everything turned on n connected quickly and this seller is a dream when making a large risky purchase on a used phone because absolutely everything regarding the transaction n product were flawless n perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great price for a practically new phone. Runs phenomenal and everything looks great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product! Iphone 11 works 100% and it's new! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looks brand new! However, the video sound isn’t playing thru the speaker."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought through Mobile Supply, phone came under 80%, needed phone for work so I couldn’t really afford to send it back, company refunded me the cost to get a new battery put in. They were very responsive and friendly, would recommend ordering through Mobile Supply."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was suppose to be in excellent condition as new… I’d hate to see the ones below this… has a huge scratch in the bottom left of the case and the speakers were full of crud along with a bunch of lint I fetched out the charging port with a toothpick… hardly in excellent condition… dead battery on arrival… hopefully it keeps a charge"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I bought this phone I didn’t realize how many issues it had. I took it to a phone repair place to get the screen replaced bcuz when I bought the phone and set it up, I kept havin a notification in the settings tellin me that the display wasn’t a genuine apple part. Only way to fix that was to change out the screen. When I took it to the phone repair place and they opened up the phone, the battery was completely fried and they said the speakers were all failin. I had to end up gettin a brand new iPhone 11 thru the phone repair place bcuz they explained to me that for what it was gonna cost to repair this iPhone 11 that I had bought on amazon that I might as well just buy a brand new one, so I did. So yeah don’t waste ur time on this phone. Ur betta off just buyin a brand new iPhone 11 than buyin this piece of crap."
"Apple","iPhone 11","2 scratches other than that cel works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased an xs max before this one and it was glitchy so I had to return it so I was really nervous about purchasing another iPhone but I went ahead and got the 11 and I’m glad I did functions properly and in like new condition very happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this refurbished phone over a month now and so far, no issues. When setting up, the phone shows no service. I watched several videos and tried trouble shooting. I also called my phone service provider on the phone, they had exhausted the troubleshooting and the problem wasn't solved. I took it in person to my phone service provider, they charged about $24 and changed the sim card. Now the phone is working great but the phone has to be charge maybe twice per day. 🤔 i"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My sister finally talked me into getting an IPhone. For a 3 month return policy I thought, why not? Not a techy gal by any means, so in a nutshell mine works well. My battery was at 84% capacity when it arrived. Very user friendly and like how I can connect easier to other IPhone users than when I had an android. Have had it for a week now and like it a lot. Still a little pricey for a phone but it does have a good camera and good responsiveness. I love my color which is Green. Also happy I went for the 128GB storage. Will probably end up keeping it👍🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Happy with purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought the phone to replace a damaged 8 plus. As Renewed product I expected scratch free screenAnd camera lens and a new/ almost new battery. The seller scored 100% on the screen and lens but scored very poorly on the battery. It came with an 80% battery. I replace mine at 75% so it will be in the shop soon. Should have gone to Apple.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great value and great price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in really good condition, battery levels within the information from the description. I really think it was a good deal. Phone has great working condition. Realized the phone was not unlocked for the needed carrier and because of that I contacted the seller. They attempted to assist and as it was not possible to fix it remotelly, they offered to replace or refund product right away and already provided the shipping details. It was a smooth communication and simple to deal with them."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Waited about a month to write this review just to make sure everything with the phone was working right. The phone was pretty much brand new, I did notice a few scratches on the camera but morning crazy. Battery level is a 94% which is GREAT for a refurbished phone. I have T-Mobile & the set & transfer of information from my previous iPhone was great, had no problems. Phone shipped and delivered fairly quick (within about 3 days). Will definitely order from this company again. 10/10."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really expected it to feel used but feels new, camera works, Face ID works, speaker work it’s amazing. Even though it doesn’t come with the original box and charger the phone is really. It’s worth the wait."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iphone 11 came with 100% Battery Health and with Perfect Quality! I switched from android, and this experience is WAYYY better than my experience on android!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works fairly well but has a compromised battery life, and after only four months of use, charges very slowly and sporadically, making it difficult to be away from a charger for any length of time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I wish they put instructions in it, but I googled and figured it out"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The device works perfectly. The back glass is near perfect. No real body blemishes or defects.But the screen has pretty harsh abrasions at the top left some of sort.Fairly sure my matte screen protector will hide this but never the less, this doesn’t exactly fall within “There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at arms length” rule listed for the refurbished quality description.This is very visible much further, especially when in any sort of light source.Also the battery life was at 85% Health which is above the promised 80% so I’ll eventually just get Apple to replace it at some point."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was very nice, but some very small spots and dents make it ordinary."
"Apple","iPhone 11","None of the IMEI was available for use by the service provider. Possible that phone was not fully unlocked. Other than that, phone looks new, clean and ready to use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product didn’t come with a SIM card tray"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this phone! It works and looks like brand new. Great price and fast shipping. My first time with facial recognition and that is so quick and easy to use!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the phone. I usually get the smaller iPhone 7 and thought I’d try something different. This phone rocks. Battery needs charged once a day but that’s no big deal. I charge when I sleep"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived fast and was as advertised. I added my SIM card and was up and running in minutes. The only disappointing thing was my phone came with a poorer battery health than what I was hoping for. But it is a used phone after all. Oh well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The transfer from my old iP 6 was easy, the extra display space is nice, the display of text and images is a bit improvement. The little ratty transformer/charger was disapointing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little skeptical about buying a Renewed iPhone at first, but there was nothing to worry about. The Phone was in perfect condition with maybe two or three minor scratches that were not even noticeable. My biggest concern was the battery health, but as you can see in the screenshot it came at 98% and hasn’t change since then. 10/10 👌"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Happy with everything with the product renewed Apple 11 I Phone.Ease of transferring data from old phone presented no problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was amazing honestly, it came early and was very easy to setup. Battery life isn’t all the way full but it’s ok, it came with a screen protector on it with a couple of scratches wasn’t visible at first but it’s ok again. Had no possible issues so far and hoping for the rest of time until I have a new phone! Was very nervous of buying at first but glad I did it! Went from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 11 glad for the upgrade."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo en excelentes condiciones, excepto el cargador, se ve de baja calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had this phone for 6 months now and it’s smooth sailing. It works beautifully. I really love this phone, and I’m glad I got it. I would definitely recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am pleased with this purchase. The only downfall is that my speaker volume isn’t as high as my last iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I returned the phone. Easy process and money refunded as described.The reason for return: battery life was only 83% and I wasn’t comfortable w the phones message UNKNOWN PART!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great! Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is functioning very well! I loved the device but battery life is 89 and this is a big problem for me! I texted the seller already and no answers. Careful while buying this device."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got this phone on December and it is still working good. I love it. It did came with a few scratches on the screen but other than that the phone is in condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like everything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Replaced my lost XR with this and had planned on an IPhone 14 Pro. The 11 is nice so I will likely wait for the 15 Pro now."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my personal cellphone and is easy to use and good for my use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","it came october 15th and never had any issues with it at all, only con is the battery life, its not THAT bad but it definitely doesnt last as long as when i first had it, came with no scratches. did come with a charger, no screen protector which is fine. 8/10 :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is great overall but was missing the SIM card tray. Thankfully it was just a $5 item at the local phone repair store."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was kinda hesitant on buying bc of some of the reviews, but definitely made the right choice in ordering.No scratches & minimal damage on the frame for a refurbished phone. Definitely looks new.I got it on time! Even felt like it was super fast shipping.Came with charging cable & box AND was super surprised it had a screen protector.Definitely is unlocked & had no issues connecting to my carrier. Phone seems to work perfect so far.SUPER GLAD I UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 7!This product is so good, I’m recommending to all that will listen lol!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in great condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ll admit I was very skeptical about buying a phone off Amazon, but as soon as I got the phone I was very impressed and super happy. It came two days after I purchased it which was amazing, it’s in perfect condition no cracks or scratches. Battery life is excellent and came with the charger and charging box, as well as a screen protector. I got the case separately. It Was supper easy to set up and is overall the best thing I have purchased on Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I Ordered for my nephew and phone is working fine. Considering his age there is absolutely no point of getting an expensive phone for him.I already got him 3 refurbished phones and no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the case however it the refurbished phone came with tempered glass a charger and wrapped. Just like new maybe a little smear print on screen however I can live like that minor scratches but very little however there were no cracks overall I am happy for what I paid for definitely an upgrade from the XR and I love my new one more!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Has a good battery life and is overall a quality phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with no scratches or scuffs in sight and it works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in as new condition. Very pleased with purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very frustrated because I should’ve known the outcome. I ordered this phone in excellent condition and it came completely scratched and knicked all over. Also, they replace the screen with a fake non apple certified so now I have a display warning in my settings. It also guarantees refunds if the battery is not at least 90% and mine came with 84%!!! I paid $100 extra for good quality and this is what they send. Don’t bother with this company"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The transfer from my old phone was painless. It's a little dicey getting the SIM card out but maybe they'll put the SIM card tool in your order. this essentially saved me $500 and keeps Verizon out of the mix which is a sure way to add on extra charges (all the while saying they are saving you money!"""
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had it for a month and everything worked great, but had to return it because at random times a dotted green line would appear across the camera screen (shown in pic) and couldn’t be removed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone!It looks and works like it’s brand new.I highly recommend it Well worth the money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m writing this on my new iPhone. I love it, everything works great, admittedly, the speaker quality isn’t that great, but barely noticeable. Don’t be discouraged by bad reviews"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything about it is good, I was nervous at first but once I got it (which was the next day) I had realized I was nervous for no reason"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sound only works on speaker phone, very disappointing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone seems fine, but the charger doesnt work. Without returning the phone, I dont know how to get a replacement charger. Any clues??"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is nice"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Personal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone was stolen, and I needed a replacement quick, definitely happy with purchase.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical lol, but the phone arrived in 2 days via FedEx. There are no scratches or any sign of wear. It came with 86% charge and fully unlocked. I was able to switch my sim from my android to the iPhone with no problem. I am beyond satisfied with this renewed phone. No lagging or slowness to the phone. It did come with a generic charger instead of an apple charger. That was the only thing I was sad about, but the charger works well. I'm happy nonetheless."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is perfect, only problem is when my screen is off I can’t see who’s calling. Never had that problem before."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works just like a new phone, very pleased with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great & safe way to buy used phones. Hands down the lowest prices even cheaper than FB Marketplace"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exceptional device. Battery life is a bit on the down side however everything works seamless. Battery percentage was roughly 85%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","my phone camera circle was cracked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little worried getting this phone with the reviews but it’s been an amazing purchase. Everything works, battery is great. 100/10 recommend:)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've only had it a couple of days, but so far so good. I works great and it looks brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in pretty good condition even came with a glass screen protector witch was good but description says battery health tested and guaranteed 80% or higher and mine came with only %78 battery capacity"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone, face recognition works well, camera is lovely. Battery life isn’t great but that may be a software update issue and not a phone issue. Service and interaction from seller was excellent when I needed it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn’t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I’ve read that it’s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great but it has some minor scratches and an unfortunate ding on the bottom. Not too big of a deal for a refurbished phone. But the final price of $500 is a bit high for a used phone. I only got this one due to it being a lot faster than waiting for new ones to be in stock, if they even still make them."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buena"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered the iPhone 11 64 gb tied to my carrier which is AT&T. I’m honestly shocked at what great condition the phone is in locks practically new no scuffs or scratches on the screen or anywhere on the body of the phone. I just popped my SIM card out of my old phone and into this one everything seems to be In working order. Very happy with the purchase face recognition works great, camera’s work great, battery life solid. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La condición de la batería me salió a un 85% lo cual está bien pero ubiera preferido que estuviera arriba del 90% de ahí el iPhone me salió con las 256GB de espacio, y el estado físico esta 10/10 solo un pequeño rasguño en una esquina pero de ahí el celular esta excelente, 100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the size"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The delivery was before the expected date , as I request seller for that. But the phone has big dent and battery life is 80 % only . I was sending it for someone who needed it urgently. I wish I had spend 150 $ more and brought I new phone ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciono perfectamente en El Salvador 100% recomendado!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i’ve had the phone for 4 days now i’d say it’s a overall 8.5 out of 10 it came nice looking with a screen protector already on it and although the screen protector did break easily and the batter health was at 82% i still would recommend the phone the camera quality is a 10/10 the quality period is just great for a phone that is reused and used for community purposes i like it 👍🏾"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my refurbished iPhone and on the screen I noticed a deep scratch so I felt it with my finger and it was smooth as there was no scratch there was a screen protector over the phone when I received it so I pulled the screen protector back and yes it is a deep scratch more of a crack than a scratch small crack I wouldn’t even care if it was on the back of the phone but on the front screen is unacceptable that’s the part that I’m actually going to be looking at and it’s annoying and it is not cheap to replace hoping to return for a different phone or return for a full exchange or refund me partial of my money to fix the broken screen other than that Phone seems fine hooked it up use it for a day easy check out fast shipping the usual Amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone knowing that anything could be possible( but I was optimistic). The phone looked new and beautiful, and it had a little scratch but it wasn’t bad. The problem was that the speaker didn’t work properly and the face recognition wasn’t good either. So, sadly I had to return it… I received my money back very fast and the costumer service was great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Increíble el producto, 89% vida útil de la batería, cámaras increíbles, reconocimiento facial, el teléfono vino en perfectas condiciones como físicas e internas."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Every things right, battery came with %100 capacity, and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx, i got the color and device storage I ordered. Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used, (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on. Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used. But its entirely like new, although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new, and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up, but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it, its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great, i came from a 2016 SE, so a big change."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came earlier than expected but so thankful it came when it did. Too early to tell how great the phone is but will say that I have a happy kid, now he has access to his phone again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone on Amazon but I’m glad I did it a huge upgrade for me from a iPhone 8 64gb to a iPhone 11 definitely recommend this phone if u want one just make sure u u don’t buy it from someone less than 80% reviews"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Didn’t come in original apple box and definitely not an apple charger. Micro scratches all over screen but barely noticeable until in light. Didn’t come with SIM card extracter but a paper clip works fine. Other than that it works great😄"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone screen had scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Currently typing a review with this phone and so farrrr, no complaints. Everything is good. For a refurbished phone, it’s does so well like a brand new phone. Battery life is excellent. Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was great andIn great condition. Only thing is that I’m glad I ordered a screen protector because the one that came with the package was shattered."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good phone the speaker don’t work all that well but overall kinda solid… z"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very hesitant due to “it’s too good to be true” old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesn’t respond to voice so me saying “ HEY SIRI” doesn’t do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer there’s a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is almost in perfect condition. I first bought XR by mistake from the same seller, returning it now because I got 11. It is working great, battery is 98%. There is a weird big smudge on the screen that doesn’t come off, but it’s fine because it doesn’t affect the screen’s performance, actually you can barely see it.Thank you for this product!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came like new condition. Very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11","If you’re thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can’t express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it’s hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit’s fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you’ll love it calls is cool it drops when I’m in a dead zone but that’s my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af 😂😂 buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent and in great condition. So good I bought another one for my son. Battery life pretty good to at 86%.Arrived a day early too!Great buy."

"Apple","iPhone 11"," Received on time, usb, adapter and sim key inside box. Phone is good as new. I’m satisfied with purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen on my phone is not an apple product and it's a third-party provider sometimes touchscreen gives some trouble."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó perfecto un familiar pidió un iPhone X en otro lugar y no le llegó bien no le encendía por lo que me dio miedo pedir en Amazon pero me decidí arriesgar y si que valió la pena me llegó perfecto y sin ni un rasguño encendió y todo mi único inconveniente es la batería que está en el 89 número que no es malo pero esperaba que fuese mayor ya que a algunos les llegó al 100 pero dejando eso de lado está perfecto muy recomendable."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All good, product met expectations but would be even better if Amazon Refreshed phones included a new battery installed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this renewed iPhone 11! When I received it, it had no cracks, or scratches it was the same as a new iPhone and the phone works great. But then I checked the battery capacity and it’s only 86% I was very disappointed because when there renewed, the seller is supposed to replace the battery but clearly it was not replace."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There are signs of normal use, but there is a visible damage on the top of the phone and on the back there are visible scratches. But the rest of it is ok!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El cel. llego a tiempo, totalmente desbloqueado.
Tiene algunos peladitos en los lados pero casi no se ven.
La batería tiene un 85% de vida útil"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great upgrade fair price, everything I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","came with a screen protector & non working off brand charger. scratches on back glass & dents on buffer. recently put a new screen protector on & noticed the front screen is completely wrecked with scratches. i bought refurbished, unlocked, 128gb, purple iphone 11. could be worse but not totally happy. i’ve bought several refurnished phone & this is definitely the worst i received. battery health good tho. works really well all in all. takes great pics. works as it should but cosmetically not worth 450$.. clean IMEI, did have to connect to a computer to properly reset."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Facebook and this is excellent battery life is great only charging every other day"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo muy bien, en excelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works well, my daughter is happy, so far no complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in IPhone box. Looked great, works great. No complaints from my teenage daughter,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Se ve como nuevo solo el cargador que venía incluido no funciona"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It amazing in all way"
"Apple","iPhone 11","They helped me by calling me and sending me a new phone, I’m really happy that they actually cared about consumers satisfaction."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far we r happy with the purchase we got it a day early I was happy about that thank u"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It had a few scratches and calling people on speaker doesn’t work but over all I haven’t had any issues with it. Saved me some money so it was worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All good!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bonito, excelente estado a pesar que se nota que no es nuevo de paquete. Trajo como dicen, un cargador genérico que lo reconoce muy bien, la batería yo diría que esta a más de 90%. Buena compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11","bad battery and no charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was amazing and nice, thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got my iphone 11 in amazing condition. like brand new,screen and back,no scratches. batery life also,used all day and before sleep put on charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone worked perfect for about 2 weeks and then the touch screen stopped working. I can’t even turn it off. I know some iPhone 11s have had this problem in the past and they say you have to have something in the screen replaced. Was thinking that since this was suppose to be an excellent refurbished phone, this would have been corrected. I was wrong :( I now have a very upset son who won’t be able to take his phone on vacation with him and call and send me pictures."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was working fine until my wife got a message last night saying that it didn’t recognize the battery as a genuine Apple battery. Now, it won’t charge at all. It registers when the battery is plugged in but it’s not increasing any even when the phone is turned off. This phone has been nothing but problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life only 83% not very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My mom really was advocating buying it at a higher price just so we could make sure it was safe but I trusted the good reviews. No scratches, came unlocked, and had a 87% battery life. I’m pretty happy with this purchase and I’m probably going to buy another for my mom as well later."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my new (refurbished) iphone 11 last week and LOVE it! It arrived earlier than expected- boxed and looking like it was brand new. No scratches or wear at all. Transferring everything from my old phone was very easy. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend. I also like that Amazon offers a 90 day return policy in case there are any problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product works fine minus a few issues for the price. I ordered a white phone and received a purple phone, but I didn't want to deal with the return and exchange process. The only other complaint I have is the speakers are messed up and sound very staticky, so that isn't ideal. Obviously not brand new, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone so....."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looked brand new. Any phone that spent its life in a case wearing a screen protector would. The battery got inordinately hot when charging and the speakerphone speaker rattled. Made me wonder how used the was.Checked battery in settings. Maximum Capacity of battery was 73%. Unacceptable. Battery charge showed 100% on top right corner of the screen; that’s 100% of 74% Maximum Capacity, as found in settings/ battery.Apple diagnostics indicated the battery had cycled 1500 times. A label on back of phone indicated “new” phone. Don’t let the packaging fool you. These phones have seen better days!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've purchased refurbs on a regular basis for many years with very few regrets. I received iPhone earlier than the site forecast. The product was in very good condition and with a screen shield. Will purchase again, the price was excellent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El audífono se escucha súper bajo, y la batería llego al 71% todo lo demás esta bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I usually don’t write reviews but I wanted to write the review on this purchase because this phone is like brand-new and I love it. I read the reviews before I purchased it and was a little worried because some said the battery life was not long and it was scratched but I received mine in perfect condition and the battery is 100% and it was a great buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Soy de Peru y mi iPhone llegó un día antes, todo funciona de maravilla hasta el momento incluyendo la duración de la batería, me llego con un cargador que no es original pero carga de maravilla y adicional a ello un protector de vidrio de regalo, súper encantada con el servicio 🫶🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm very happy with the mint color case as well as the features with this model smart phone! I went from a Samsung Galaxy Sky and this phone is far better to use, and has so much more available features. It has been refurbished and even had the extra glass screen protector! Couldn't be more satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great renewed phone looks brand new. So far I have not had any problems with it. Battery is working well. Will I upgrade in a year or so YES. I will be getting it through Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I use this phone everyday. I like the face recognition, finger reader. I also like the size of the screen. Very satisfied✅."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received the phone with awful battery, if you have the money i recommend getting a new one and saving, time and effort my screen isn't always responsive when texting aswell.Other better alternatives for the money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As advertised- excellent condition even came with a screen protector. Will save seller and purchase from in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m overall happy. I haven’t had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. I’m not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I don’t need phone insurance.There weren’t any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isn’t any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Easy set up, fully unlocked. Perfect phone love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love everything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great! It was fully unlocked. I have had no trouble setting it up. I highly recommend. The price is great for the phone. It works like n new phone. The Face ID works great. There was no starches. It is is good shape. The batter life was at 86. Which is great for a used phone. The shipping was packed very well. It came with a charger & a screen protector. It also came with a thing to take your sims card out which is great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product, great price, great seller, no regrets of my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","el producto llegó con una raya imperceptible, no me genera mayor problema, con 91% de rendimiento en la batería, fuera de eso, impecable. liberado para todas las compañías, lo uso con Personal en Paraguay."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent delivery time, product condition also excellent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Only used it a few days. So far it works well and am happy with purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone overall is in great condition, the screen doesn’t have any noticeable scratches or damage and the only damage I can see on the body is some light chipping near the camera. The big issue is that the battery health is already at 77% which is pretty poor, overall I’m not too upset considering the price but I expected the battery health to be higher considering others’ reviews on here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 that I got today is AMAZING I’m young n I usually go through mi god mom or auntie to get phones but this Time I shopped for one on my own n I had the phone for not even 24 hour so I’m going to come back in 3 weeks but absolutely amazing so far recommend!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Considering the number of reviews of many internet items being way off the mark regarding condition I was pleasantly surprised, when I opened the package to find the the phone, in what i consider, to be in perfect condition - the phone is virtually unmarked with no scratches or blemishes , and everything functions as per the factory specs. I would definitely buy again from this seller and recommend to other potential buyers.For a quality item with a reasonable price and fast shipping, I would rate this transaction A+"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works really well and set up was easy! The face recognition works like a charm and the battery life is pretty good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the phone that I received but I ordered two not one, I’ve tried to get help to see what to do or if the other phone is coming and nothing!!Everything was taken care of and my second phone was sent out quickly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is lighter and thinner than previous model bought it to replace 8+ hoping it would improve glitches with garage band plug ins did not. Get an iPhone SE if you just want an eight plus with upgraded chip. Other than that big screen. Dropped it from five feet up at lax on hard floor and it didn’t even tarnish it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El iPhone me vino con un pequeño rayón en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla y con 91% de vida útil de la batería. Quitando esas dos cosas, todo lo demás está en perfecto estado, todas las piezas originales.En la caja venía un protector de pantalla y un cargador que no es el original pero está certificado para usarse en iphone y cumple bien su función.Me gustó el detalle del protector ya que cuando el dispositivo tiene el protector puesto no se le nota el rayón.Con el tiempo que llevo usándolo puedo decir que estoy satisfecho con mi compra, está aceptable si recordamos que es un dispositivo renovado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great daughter loved it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i bought this phone expecting it to be unlocked. took up 3 hours of my time setting up this phone just to find out that the sim is locked & was not unlocked like it says it is. don’t waste your time getting this from. (at least not from this provider) now i have to get a refund & take the time to go through a return with this item. highly disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelent.Berry good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was looking at this phone for a while and finally decided to buy it and it was delivered relatively quick but once received I noticed the left speaker was broken."
"Apple","iPhone 11","as far as ik of the phone came with all original parts the only 3rd party thing was the charger and it came with a glass screen protector that took away the scratches that was on the display but if u have it directly in the light u could somewhat see it but no problem it was like a new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","can’t hear very well when on the phone, and also been told they can’t hear me sometimes. but other than that it’s a great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is an older model Apple I-phone that was refurbished. It had some very minor scratches on the back which is what we expected. The phone was shipped with no battery power so it had to be charged before it could be used. The battery charged to 88% of a new phone. The phone worked and after a couple of weeks of use I am happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came like new with no scratches and no pixel damage or background images burned in that I sometimes get with refurbished phones. Battery life came at 89% so not the best but above average. Had it for a week with no problems but will update."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great, looked brand new. There’s literally no scratch on it, not even one. It does not use fingerprint, so far the face recognition works good, battery health is 83%, it’s quite okay. I dnt charge more than once a day even when I play game. Have no problem so far, runs pretty smoothly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Well they don’t pay me or do I have any ties with this company. But no issues with there product. I needed a replacement phone for my kid and went here to get it. The phone I order came just as I hey said it would. It was in good shape for a use phone. I would refer them to anyone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing condition, came dead but fully unlocked, using it on Verizon, great price, and I was really scared it wouldn’t work, especially for under $400 but it pulled through guys. I got the iPhone 11 in black and I used the SIM card from my old phone and it worked right away."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego muy bien empacado y sin daños por el manejo, muy buen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone looks BRAND NEW like described This is not a scam it took me about 28 days to save up to buy great buy 👍 definitely recommend."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was like new! Couldn’t have been happier with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Otimo iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in very good condition, and it arrived earlier than expected which was nice. The phone is quite responsive and the battery life is rather impressive. I can’t remember the last time I had a phone I only had to charge every other night after using it all day."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've purchased refurbed iPhones in the past and always have been happy with the cosmetics of the phones and the battery health. This purchase was disappointing as there were numerous scratches on the upper right screen corner as well as what looks like small divots worn into the screen in a few places (like it constantly rubbed on something in a purse or pocket). In addition, the battery health was at 89% (within the 80% spec Amazon has), but I've never received a phone with less than 95% life. This is why I only rated this purchase a 3 star, however, it was delivered quickly as promised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really nice, looks brand new and works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have bought from this Seller before and had no issues. I have been due for an upgrade and hate contracts so I prefer to buy my phone outright and save a little bit of money using prepaid services.

This phone came and it runs SO SLOW! Not only that, but upon inspection, the speaker holes and the charger point were absolutely FILTHY. The speaker holes were FILLED with gunk. I had to manually try to dig out all the gunk that filled the holes. The paper towel is the residue I was able to clean out. Also, the buttons are crusty. I have no idea what this phone went through before it made it’s way to me but it definitely did not match it’s description as “Excellent condition”, and to top things all off, the phone was at 84% battery capacity when it arrived. My previous phone purchased from this seller was at 95%.

Use your own discretion. I have contacted both Amazon and the seller, but I have decided that these greivances were not worth it to me and decided to buy myself a phone directly from Apple to spare myself any future headaches. This phone isn’t worth $300."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product!! No issues works and looks like new!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","it works soo wellll. it comes with a charger. the box had me a bit scared i thought it was going to be fake. but it turned out to be greatt the white is so pretty"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don’t really know why, but when my IPhone 7 Plus started giving me trouble and I needed a new phone, I let someone talk me into trying an android. 2 weeks later I returned the android. I love my IPhones too much! This IPhone 11 is so nice. I absolutely love the face recognition. I bought the yellow and it is so pretty. The size is perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really like this phone. It looks brand new and works great. There are still so many new things to learn about it that I'll have a great time
Learning everything about it. It is the same size as my iPhone 7, but the screen size is larger, so it will still fit in my pocket and my purse."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very skeptical about purchasing this phone online. However, the phone came in excellent condition. Not sure if was just my luck but the phone had zero scratches, the battery life is perfect (one full charge last for at least two days). Everything works fine so far. Hoping it remain the same for another year or more"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good phone at this point in time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After a three year hiatus of wanting another phone from the iPhone 6plus which by the way was a replacement from my 8plus at the time … yea I know you all like what the … lol yes times was hard lol came across this phone read the reviews and since I’ve purchased online in the past I’m like why not shipping was like less then 48 hrs! Phone arrived without original packaging but they did a great job package that once it get to you it’s in a safe condition! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Battery life greAt! The speaker sound is Amazing! But the Camera’s!!!!!!! Take the cake all the way home! I feel like a real
Photographer! Lol I be ready to go to nature trails etc! This is definitely a GREAT BUY for an FANTASTIC price!!! 👌🏽"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone looked like new, fully refurbished on the outside. Sadly it had a major issue. It took nearly 24 hours to fully charge. It also went from full charge to turn off dead within 2-3 hours. Wasted $50 of my money on a case and screen protectors, wasted my time transferring and setting up my new device and now I’m without a phone. I purchased an iPad a few months ago with the same issue, thought it was a 1 time bad experience. Phone, even when plugged in won’t take enough of a Charge to not drain and die. Amazon refurb has let me down 2 times. Would be great to buy something that’s actually tested fully prior to sending off. Called the refurb companies phone, left a message, 2 weeks later, no response. I would definitely not recommend buying these products. I know I’m Not a happy camper… again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","We panicked because we were not home for a couple of days. when we returned the parcel was not at the door .. started looking but did not find .. it turned out the neighbor realized that we were not at home and took us .. we rang the doorbell but no one was .. only a day later she showed up😁. glue looks new. very satisfied .. I'll check later how the phone works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in perfect condition and works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This has been the most terrible experience I’ve had in a long time! I’m a disabled person receiving ssi, and I purchased this phone to have an iPhone, and at least save some by getting refurbished because I live off ssi check. Now the phone that I received is terrible, at first the package seemed to have moisture inside of it. I don’t know why or how? But the packaging came disgusting! The phone came with a screen protector that was flimsy so I took it off to inspect came to notice it has a bunch of scratches on the screen! Let alone it took me forever to turn it on’ I didn’t know if it was because it came dead or broken, but I did manage to turn it on! So I messaged the seller for a refund, and he told me to call fedex and set up a pick up and practically deal with it myself! I don’t have a cellular with service to pick up and call fedex and I don’t do much with out my social worker, I messaged Amazon and told them the seller was leaving me in the dark and they told me to wait 5-7 days for my refund… am not satisfied at all. They have no respect for the disable. Now I bet with in 5-7 day I’ll get the same message from them telling me contact fedex or keep waiting! I hope this all gets resolved. I should not have to go there this! I will be updating…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me decidí comprar al vendedor por su reputación, pagando un valor adicional al precio promedio, sin embargo el teléfono no cumplió con mi expectativa, condición física y batería."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with no SIM card slot because the screen was replaced and isn’t a genuine screen, it’s lifted at the corner a little bit as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen reconocimiento facial, lector de huellas bien, batería vida útil"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy Bien en gral, salvo alguna rayones en la esquina superior derecha de la pantalla, que se notan al estar oscura"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got a lot more than i expected. This is a really nice phone, definitely an upgrade from iPhone 6, it was better than i imagined and works seamlessly. I don’t see any flaws at all. Bought purple because it was cheapest and now its just my favorite color,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was perfect no complaints!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had an issue, and they immediately solved it and the process was easy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am trying the used version for my new iphone. I bought this one from amazon. First time buying a used phone. I am not pleased with how hard it was to download my information from my Iphone 7 to this phone. It took 2 days and various idividuals to make it happen. It was supposed to be unlocked etc. but the guy at the verizon store even told me it was being difficult. After an hour of trying only the stuff on my icloud was downloaded and none on my apps. So I had to go home and reload all of that. Trying to remember all the user id's and passwords. I wish I would have just ordered a new phone. I really didn't save all that much either. Especially after I had to pay the guy at the verizon store to help."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with 77% battery capacity. It was promised that the phone would exceed a battery capacity of 80%. I was very disappointed that it came with a lower capacity. The phone also had a small noticeable dent above the power button. Honestly if I was the seller I would not sell. Other than that the phone works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I liked that it’s in excellent condition. Literally looks brand new. Works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","has a lot of scratch and voice problem"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Mine came with 2 cracks on it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No problem with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m very happy with it! I totally recommend it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was in like new conditions. Used for about 6 months with no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall the product was ok. But it had many signs of use and several scratches on various parts of the device, for this reason, I decided to return it. The seller was very attentive in the return process, I had no problems returning the product and getting the amount back, great seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I’m feeling I should’ve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that’s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren’t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I’m afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I’ve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far great. No scratches like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No scratches, network compatible."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product received today on time, in the correct memory size and color, and in excellent shape. However, upon inserting the SIM card and trying to set it up, I learned that it is carrier-locked to Boost Mobile. I had ordered a phone compatible with T-Mobile. Hopefully Boost can unlock it tomorrow but now I have to wait another day when I should have just been able to swap in my existing SIM card and be ready to go. I would recommend ordering unlocked for nearly the same price, not worth the hassle trying to fix this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There is a spot of darkness on the screen and it came with a screen protector already on it. The battery health shows up as needs service so I am not sure how fixed up these phones are before being sold. There are no scratches so it is great in that aspect but I really wish the battery was in better condition and there were no screen problems.
EDIT: It has been one full day and I have noticed at darker screen levels that there are actually three different spots with really bad screen darkening, very disappointing and would probably return if I had not spent the day transferring everything to this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn’t have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came a day early so that’s awesome very small chips noticed but not enough to make the phone look bad. Battery health was at 88% so that would be the only thing I wish I would of been told. But other than that pretty happy with the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was on all really good the battery life is only at 86 but it is renewed so better than expected everything is perfectly almost just Brand New except for the battery life everything else is perfect had it for a while but haven’t had no problems"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don’t about y’all but my phone came really good no scratches,no screen lifting, or other problems people having to be honest it’s just a 50/50 chance"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just as advertised perfect condition works really well just as brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s been a few days and it’s working perfectly fine. Only flaws is that it didn’t come in a nice box and the charging brick plus the wires was off brand. Overall 4/5. It would be a good phone for older people in my opinion, not too good neither too bad, just right for them."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Every thing just GREAT; RECEIVE EARLY and I was VERY HAPPY. VERY HAPPY"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó antes de tiempo, y funciona tal y como explica el vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looked like new. No scratches or dents."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I took a chance and ordered a phone I'm not gonna lie I was a little nervous but it works great and it was easy to set up as a replacement phone took less then 10 mins . I couldn't be happier Thank you ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No damage, only thing is scratches around the charger port but it’s no problem to me I didn’t expect perfection. Everything works. Glad I was able to find this deal since my XS max broke. The battery on this 11 lasts longer than my old phone too. Nothing amazing, but better."
"Apple","iPhone 11","honestly was super scared it wasn’t gonna work but it came in early with no scratches no cracks and a screen protector already which love y’all for that. Everything was easy to set up and it connected to my sim card perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","already had a screen protector installed... not a big deal, but still, refurbished? My ass. Also main issue: battery health was 86% !!! for an excellent condition phone I think that is BS."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I thought getting a renewed phone would be a better option because it’s cheaper. If you are trying to get a new phone buy it new because I made a big mistake. When I received my phone I noticed that the speaker at the top doesn’t work it sounds muffled. So when I call I can’t even hear the other person, nor can they hear me. When I call I have to put it on speaker or use my AirPods. That was only the first problem. Then I noticed that when you shake the phone there is something lose inside it. Also the up volume doesn’t work. To make things even worse I contacted the seller notifying them about all these issues. They contacted me back saying that I am free to return the phone but I will only be receiving $25 back when I paid almost $400 for this phone. In conclusion please dont buy from this seller or even refurbished/renewed products in general. Also the screen on it is lifting on the left side."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bout the purple 256 gb and it looks brand new! I’m so happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It wasn’t for me but it was a gift for my niece and he’s enjoying it. If he doesn’t complain I don’t have any complaint. I totally recommend the buying of this item."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There possibly will be a couple small scratches on the sides but other than that nothing else is broken or scratched. I would totally recommend buying this and is such a great price for this phone. Also it’s very easy to set up and I had no issues with it so far!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I took my new phone to the phone store to have my information transferred from my old apple 6 plus...bought a screen protector and case for it...When the clerk was putting on the screen cover he noticed some scratches on the screen.. Very disappointing... He was almost done.. I have kept the phone because of all the time and effort and added expense.. MISS not having a button on the bottom... Wish one would receive a booklet when you make a purchase like this.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought it for my wife on our anniversary. Came with a few scratches on the edges, not noticable when using the case, so not a problem. It had a screen protector on so a good addition while I bought a new one. Happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've had a good experience with renewed devices on amazon in the past, but this one is an exception. The phone arrived with 84% battery health. The whole point of it being ""renewed"" (refurbished) is that, in general, the device will look and function roughly the same as it did when it was new. Getting 16% less battery life from a full charge straight out of the box is unacceptable."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good condition. Could not have asked for more."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received the the renewed iPhone which was posted as in “ excellent condition “ pretty fast, at first look it looked ok , mb not excellent but good condition but i have noticed that there is a screen protector installed already and I decide to remove and fully inspect the phone , and OMG after removing the screen protector the display itself was heavily scratched, with even a dent :( . I don’t know if the phone can be categorized as “ fair condition” or “ bad condition “ with such a heavy damage, trying to return it , hope everything will go smoothly and will give them another chance because they have many renewed options, and hope this is an exception not the rule, how they are trying to hide scratches and damage installing a screen protector instead of replacing the display. Will update as soon as i will receive the replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fue una excelente compra mi hija está contenta con su primer celular muchas gracias."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s very good. Packaging was poor but is good. Fully unlocked. It dies a hole lot quicker then the others I do say but not a big deal since there’s iPhone chargers everywhere in my house and car. The charger it came with crumbled in my hands the minute I touched it which was unusual. Very good not 5g though"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I’ve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It’s nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it’s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I’m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you’re looking into this phone I’d say go for it. I’m on day 1 and I’m excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I’m 1 month in with the phone and it’s still working great no issues at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything works fine no issues with the phone itself but it has a lot of scratches on the back of the phone and the edges also. Besides that the battery life, face recognition, and actual phone functions all work perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just purchased this for my 14 yr old daughter and it's a really good phone. It's almost like new. It has a couple of scratches but you really can't tell they're there unless the phone is up to your nose. Other than that it's perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this refurbished iPhone 11 and am glad I did. This company expedited shipping, my iPhone arrived quickly, well-packaged, & works like a charm, everything as promised & super easy setup. The battery life is impressive. I will buy from them again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter said that everything works wonderful and it's a great upgrade for her"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I loved the phone itself came in great condition wish the battery lasted longer though but everything was great💯☺️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length. Not true. Very very visible scratches. However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them. Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this for my daughter and she seems to love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not sure about anybody else but mines in tip top shape (like brand new)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is good except the annoying buzzing noise while in speaker mode.Returning the product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No seller in Houston could match this excellent price!! Brand new condition with original plastic cover and casing!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered this phone for my mom. Shes replacing an iphone 6s. Transferred everything over bluetooth in minutes. Had the phone up and running in less than 10 minutes. Phone came clean and polished. No scratches or defects. Battery was charged at 65%. Inserted the Mint Mobile sim card and within seconds we could receive texts and calls. Everything works perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition work well except with mask obviously the battery is not that high but for a iOS it’s normal."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It didn’t work with my boost mobile SIM for some unknown reason so I had to get a T mobile SIM which worked. Great product, looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not a single issue with this, hooked up to straight talk no issues. No scratches or dings or cracks in sight, pretty much a brand new iPhone. I love it so much!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My first Apple product since the ipod. Which still works BTW. I suffered through a whole series of android phones. Had issues with them. Calls dropped, bad reception. Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail. I blamed my carrier and I was wrong. It was the phones.Easy to use. Better texting/fast fewer mistakes. More intuitive. So simple to pair accessories. Just works effortlessly. I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time. It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap. I am now an Apple person. My next computer will be Apple too. I am done fighting with technology. I want it to work for me and Apple does that."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the smartphone arrived with some deep scratches on the screen! I did not like!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got excellent because it said no scratches on screen. The phone I received had scratches and dents on the bottom of the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agrado que no se mencione que la batería estaba a un 70 por ciento además que el mismo teléfono indica el cambio de la misma"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the phone for my 16yr old daughter she loves the phone, we ask for yellow they ran out, but he made sure to call me and ask what else color so my daughter pick green, it’s cute minor scratches but nothing serious. It’s fully unlocked and works perfectly.. this is the 3rd One I have purchase through this seller never disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This product seems to work fine in the US. Someone told me my phone comes up from Mexico whenI called. Not sure but I think that is the phone because I am using the same service that I have for years. I wish apple had left finger reader on iphone11. The battery life is better then iphone7.Over all I am happy with this item."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Super for I phone 11. Excellent reconditioned phone. Like new and everything works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","works perfectly fine, the screen isn't cracked or scratched up. The volume is good, the entire phone works like it's new. Nothing's wrong with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bonito el equipo, buen estado, compre 2 y uno tiene el 84% y el otro el 82% de vida de la batería. Hubiese esperado al menos un 90%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ultimately, this is a purchase I live to regret. It takes forever to charge and when it came, the screen was not working. I chose not to return it, because where I’m from, customs would have charged me almost $100 to send the phone back. The phone functions ok, but the battery life is an annoyances and I had to get the screen fixed. The company was however, swift with their response to rectify, however I wished the phone actually functioned as described."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Definitely worth the money! My phone came in perfect condition and looks and performs like new. My only complaint is that the screen protector it came with was meant for a size smaller phone so the screen protector cracked easily but my phone is fine!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When i applied my first screen protector it looked fantastic. But it made the touch sensitivity almost non responsive. I tried another one and the same thing happened. I am upset because i would have liked my phone to be compatible with accessories such as a screen protector. Other than that it is fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First off, this phone came super early which is already a plus. It looks and runs like new but the max battery capacity is 86%, which isn’t great. But other than that, it’s a great phone. Easy to setup and in great shape. I will update in about a month if using it.UPDATE: it’s been a little over a month and it still runs just fine. Sometimes the touchscreen is a little off, but very rarely. Camera is great, battery is pretty good. Would recommend. Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything cosmetically about the phone is perfect. The phone came with 84% battery health which is the only flaw but the phone doesn’t die quick it works great.No scratches, no dents it is perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm not giving it one star because the phone came in good condition and works fine. The only reason I feel disappointed is because the phone has an non-Genuine aftermarket screen, no where in the description does it say the phone has been replaced with non-Genuine apple parts. I feel disappointed because now the phone has a message saying that the display is not genuine. I felt like I was cheated and would like to request to have another one shipped out but with the genuine screen. Or at least a partial refund. So buyer BEWARE if you buy from here you could get shipped an iPhone that has non genuine aftermarket parts. Which we all know the quality is no were near a Genuine apple part."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buen producto, sin golpes ningún detalle"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far everything is great looks like a new phone also came with a tempered glass awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s perfect <3 My date got me this phone as a v times day gift and I just absolutely love it there’s no problems at all (not a paid review lol :,> ) there are a few scratches on the side but it’s nothing a phone case can’t fix the back and front came with no scratches for me but for everyone it may be different there are absolutely NO issues with the phone easy to get in adding you Apple ID and everything it’s just a overall good phone! So if your having second thoughts about ordering this Don’t it’s indeed the real deal :> ok I’m done now follow me on Instagram and tik tok tho and if you need more information on this feel free to contact me @Jxstsalt on Instagram and tik tok <3"
"Apple","iPhone 11","pleased with phone so far after a couple months"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i assumed the phone was gonna be crappy because i didn’t fully trust the fact it i was being ordered from amazon but i stand corrected. the phone came perfect no scratches nor defects, battery last awhile, and the face recognition works how it would on any other phone. the phone isn’t slow or hard to use, it really is amazing! if you’re thinking about buying from this seller please do so :D"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was good but it had its little problems . Annoyed me for the most part but I got over it . I mean it works so heyy , I’m good ! Just make sure uu look everywhere b4 spending your money bc I spent it then boom a lower price somewhere else"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got this phone for my son! Was worried at first because it is not brand new but it looks brand new and has been great so far! Completely unlocked and ready to go!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m very happy with this purchase. I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone, but it actually turned out great! I bought it in the best condition I could get, and everything works as it should. Color is gorgeous too!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything was perfect other than the screen protector is a little crooked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the purple iPhone11 it came I perfect condition!!! I was a little weary about buying a phone off of Amazon, but I’m so glad that I did!!! The only complaint I have is the battery health is at 88% but that’s nothing a new battery can’t fix!!!! I love it so much!!! Highly suggest getting it if you are on the fence!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Vida de la batería 100%, detalle en la pantalla. Cargador genérico."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my new iPhone 11, I was a little apprehensive about making this purchase, as it is my first time, but I am happy with making this decision."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it’s so new and improved that i don’t ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i’ve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn’t know how to use it😂best part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i’m pretty pumped about that.thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto está en buen estado físico como de batería, llegó a tiempo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It meets my expectations!"

"Apple","iPhone 11"," So far so good, just that the battery takes long period to charge and it runs out fast."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far no problem about this product at all"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product came in a really cute box, with a screen protector inside the box and a charger(not an apple one but it works fine) and the sim card removal tool. I’ve been using the phone for a couple of days now and so far so good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Glad I purchased this phone that is unlocked and renewed on Amazon. So far so good. Sure beat paying all that $for a new I phone. Phone looks new, no scratches or anything. Glad to find it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far no complaints. However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual. All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study. It's amazing all the things this phone can do!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone I received initially had a crack. I left the seller with a not-happy note. The seller responded quickly and professionally to offer a refund or replacement. It took about 3 weeks total from initial ordering the phone to receiving a phone as described. Now, I enjoy using my new phone very much."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased a refurbished iPhone with my fingers crossed; however, this arrived in immaculate condition, well packaged with the charger and a little stand. I could not find a mark on it. Took it to my carrier to be added to my service and he said I got a very good deal. It even came in yellow; my favorite color."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Estéticamente perfecto, pero la condición de la batería está en 78% más baja de lo que ofrecen.De lo contrario todo bien"

"Apple","iPhone 11","After 1.5 weeks I’m very happy with the phone. Was in great condition. I upgraded from a 6s so big difference. Battery life is great and getting used to a newer model. Overall really happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased in Mid-June 2022, screen began glitching almost immediately and eventually would not turn on at all. By July I contacted the company regarding an exchange, they informed me that they do not do exchanges and I need to purchase a replacement and they will refund me once they receive the defective product. I have yet to receive my refund. I'm pretty annoyed because if I wanted to spend $600 on a phone I would have just purchased new..So far so go on the replacement phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Grandson good the new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Este es mi tercer equipo renovado comprado en amazon , y no me ha decepcionado.Fisicamente el equipo en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, trae el protector de pantalla puesto (tenia un globito pero algo diminuto)El telefono es muy rapido, la bateria vino 88%, y tengo unos 2 meses ya con el equipo y esta funcionando perfecto…solo en 1 ocacion se me frizio , solo lo apague y encendi y todo bien…me parecio leer que traia un cover de regalo el cual no lo trajo pero si el cargador con su cable generico.Recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","it’s cute cause it’s yellow but it do be kinda laggy lmao its chill"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Decided to go the refurbished route after buying new phones up to this point. I am very pleased with the phone (iPhone 11 128gb). It looks and performs like a new phone, for a significant savings. The battery health is at 85%, but that is more than enough to last a full day and then some."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My mom's old iPhone from 2014 was on its last leg so I figured I would surprise her for her birthday. The iPhone 11 was quite the upgrade so she was thoroughly satisfied. Definitely did not disappoint."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great. Good for its price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the phone, to be honest. It's cool. This is my first iPhone, so I'm just going to see how it goes."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am happy for the 28K people who seem pleased with these refurbed iphones. However, my phone could not be used as the ATT store could not get the antennae to load up my service. I tried to return but it was very difficult for me to understand. Then life happened and ran into some issues. 3 months later, I took the phone back to the store hoping it would work, but didn't. They would nopt allow a return because of no warranty. But even if I had purchased the warranty, I did not understand the icloud steps I had to follow to return. Anyway, BUYER BEWARE. I am fortunate that my burned up $350 will not affect my wellbeing and it was a lesson learned. Glad I didn't spend another 100 on a warranty that would have been rejected anyway."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This iPhone works great there are no flaws! Highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very hesitant to buy it, but I actually exceed my expectations. It's super nice, I give it a 10/10 aesthetic. I haven't used it much yet, but as far as I've seen it, I liked it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","En líneas generales está bien, sólo que la batería no dura casi nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It arrived in time. Looks just like new. Will be getting my sons phone here"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was great! No scratches, battery life was at 85% I believe which is decent. Everything was working and it’s been great. A great upgrade from an iPhone 8 plus!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i ordered from this seller because they offered 4 day shipping. Its been 4 days now and they are now saying to wait another week. im sure the phone will be nice, but if you can get it from somebody else more truthful."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ear speaker is not working it is really really low cost $55 to replace yes easier than sending it back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.WELL, let’s just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like it’s brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but it’s something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love my phone it came very quick. No scratches are dents looks new works well I've had no problems with phone I don't do reviews so I can honestly say this phone is worth buying not a scam and also came in apple boxing"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was really excited to upgrade from XR to this phone and the first thing I noticed on it was the camera has scrapes around it , I almost noticed holes or something on the color pain job around it. Not sure if that’s supposed to look like that but it made me feel grossed out a little 😫. I did notice a scrape on the side of it as well. I knows It’s a refurbished phone but I paid 550 for it and not sure if I want a refund to just buy a new one off of the Apple store."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No traía ningun rasguño, todo funcionaba a la maravilla. Gracias por el cubo de carga, aunque era generico, se agradece ya que los recientes ni eso incluyen lol"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a huge upgrade from my iPhone 8. I absolutely love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came unlocked, had a few scratches not really noticeable though. Battery health was at 86%. Overall is a good phone for the money that was spent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, it’s this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldn’t ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldn’t by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in looking almost new. No visible scratches or dings. Battery life of 84%. Lasts all day"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical to order a phone from Amazon but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered Prime and it arrived even earlier than it said. The phone looked absolutely brand new with one very minor scratch you can only see if you examine really close. I would buy again. Came with 90% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition, fingerprint reader and wonderful color made this iPhone unique. My son loved his iPhone and feel happy about that he is owning one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very minor cosmetic damage that was easy to cover with a case and a screen protector! Battery life is about as good as possible."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fast shipment, Excellent Condition and I love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had this pastel purple iPhone 11 now for over a year and I’m still very happy with it!! I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ to the 11. I got it with 256g of memory so it holds a lot. Battery and everything else is still going strong. Very happy with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it’s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I’ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My mom loves her phone. Arrive faster than expected and thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn’t at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn’t come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn’t read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works everything’s I would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","We bought this phone just before Thanksgiving 2021 for our daughter for Christmas. I was unable to provide an honest rating due to not opening it.Now that it's been a few days, my daughter absolutely loves it! She states that the battery life is exponentially greater than her old iPhone 5 and the photo quality is immaculate! She loves the green color and everything about it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The first phones received had a crack on the screen the battery life was 94%. I received a replacement three days after realizing and the replacement had a battery life of 84%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really need a phone as I just had a galaxy S8 and bought it in 2018 and back in 2020 I decided to put my money towards this instead of a more expensive brand new iPhone and I’m glad I did! It did come with a very faint scratch on the screen which isn’t noticeable unless you really focus but after putting a screen protector on it isn’t even visible anymore."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Okay for the price but chipped/ cracked bottom corner of screen and the battery wasn’t 80% life or more. Would not called in like new condition. More like used or damaged."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter is enjoying her new phone she went from a 7plus to the 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is in good condition. But the battery life is not as promised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I didn’t expect that the iPhone continues remains me that the screen replacement used is not an original apple part"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought it because my mom needed one and they were out of stock at Apple. But it came with a very scratched screen, battery only charges up to 80%. Price was way to high. I might return it if I’m able to come back home within the return period."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone arrived in ""like new"" condition. The battery is better than my old phone was and will go all day wirhout needing a charge. Would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 It’s a good phone but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I had to unlocked the FaceTime and imessages ( from turning green ) on. If have any of those difficulties please contact apple right away and they’ll help you. You’ll thank me in the future. 💯if you notice , the purple phone always tends to work better than the other colors phone by looking at these reviews."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is ok. Face time doesn’t work"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is perfect I think the phone is reasonable in price and quality so I would strongly recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very high quality and as good as new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.
Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My cousin said it worked fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","came in good condition, battery around 80%. i miss the fingerprint reader, the face recognition is kind of annoying. good camera. good value for the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a android and now iphone due to my kids lol"
"Apple","iPhone 11","all the bad reviews made me worried, but I ordered it, and not only did it come three days early, but its beautiful and has no issues whatsoever, also came with a screen protector placed on perfectly! buy it :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This product came in really fast and although I was skeptical it came without any scratches or any damage to the phone and a phone charger. Although it didn’t come in the original apple box it came very secure. If you want a cheaper iphone like this one I would definitely give this one a try"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its not opened before xmass. Im happy it arrived earlier than expected. More comments after xmass"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All good, but only top speaker was broken."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La vida útil de la batería baja, los demás va excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an arm’s length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.
So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!

I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All i can say is “ It’s worth it” i did hesitate to buy it but it looks, feels and works like a brand new Iphone.. thank you🔥🔥🔥"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recommend this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exactly what I was hoping for!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","it had some scars on the back camera and the side of the phone, and the battery life was only 91, which was way much lower than I expected. Besides these things, everything worked just fine, but still I wouldn't say I am satisfied with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My boyfriend just bought me this phone as a late anniversary gift since he knew I had been wanting one, it came unlocked as it was stated. I wish it didn’t have little bits of scratches in the corners shown in the pictures but once I put a case on it won’t matter. I also would of liked the battery life to be 100% but again, I’m just glad it looks as good as it does and I appreciate that it even already had a screen protector on it. And it came super fast! Thanks so much (:"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen almacenamiento y buenas cámaras"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is much smaller then I thought it would be. My old iPhone 8 Plus is around 6’1 inches and this phone is smaller then that. Yes it advertised that the battery max is 82%. However if that’s the case the price can come down some more. The packing was really bad. The phone setup is slow but after that it works pretty good. If you care more about size then I wouldn’t recommend because it’s smaller then the 8plus which is 100 dollars cheaper and works really the same. However, if you don’t care about size then I recommend you get it but the battery might be a issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","sin duda alguna ha sido una de las mejores compras que hecho Celular vino muy bien empaquetado traía un cargador y cubo para cargar muy bueno La condición de la batería es excelente yo creí que iba ser menos por ser reacondicionado pero tiene un 95% de batería Y en la parte física del teléfono lo veo muy bien están muy bonitos tal vez tiene unos pequeños raspones y Rayones en la pantalla pero son casi nulos , Y si funcionó el desbloqueo de la banda así que sólo puedo decir que es la mejor compra que he hecho y que recomiendo mucho al comprador buyspring"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just like new, I haven’t had any issues since I bought."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El iPhone 11 llegó bastante nuevo y con protector de pantalla incluido y esta desbloqueado valió la pena hacer la inversión y la batería esta en 89% de vida útil nada mal para ser un teléfono usado ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo está muy bien reconocimiento facial y el lector de huellas dactilares la batería está en 89% no único que no llego los Auriculares y el cargador que no es muy bueno demora mucho en cargar"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent condition, affordable price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just received and turned on my iPhone 11 from Amazon. Everything appeared to be in good shape except... my battery max capacity is below 80% !!! Also, I have had ZERO luck with tech support. I expected better quality than this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this phone for my Dad, works perfectly and arrived like brand new phones. No scratches or any issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Didn’t realize that it didn’t have an EarPod hookup. Now I am waiting for a separate attachment to use for audiobooks. Recommend including this piece of information in product description for tech challenged buyers to know at time of purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve purchased iPhones from Amazon in the past, all amazing…though there are bad reviews about this iPhone I still ignored them and purchased one anyways… I received the phone about almost a week later after purchasing it everything on the phone was fine great condition and everything worked except… The phone didn’t register SIM cards, which means that the phone would never be able to get turned on. It would only work on Wi-Fi I even took it to geek squad for a diagnostic and they told me the phone had internal damage and that the previous owner had already ran a diagnostic on the phone… meaning that the phone I bought had already been returned for the exact same reason and the seller still sold it again… Save your money and time and purchase one in stores

(only good thing is the seller returned my money within a week of me returning it)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I order an unlocked iPhone 11, and received it with sim lock on it.. I tried troubleshooting with Amazon, apple and was also told to call T-Mobile but they said the phone didn’t belong to them. I was very sad as I was excited to set up my new phone.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Liked the product but didn’t appreciate the double charge from my checking account n still have heard no response after I have messaged to customer serviceVoukx someone please take care of this matter immediately. Very disappointed about the situation"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No finger print reader,, battery life sucks right , there is something’s you can’t do"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I was looking for a new phone, I didn’t care that it was renewed. I’ve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the color and how it protects the phone from the sun when in the car."
"Apple","iPhone 11","After maybe a month or 2 of having my phone it started turning on and off by itself all the time and then I looked it up and then found out it was because my screen had risen. Now keep in mind I had not taken my phone out of its case for the entire time of having it! The cause of this problem was that they didn’t properly install the screen back on. I then texted the owner and I was asking for them to fix it because it’s not my problem, it’s there’s. The owner will not take my phone back to fix the damages they have caused. Sorry if your phone messed up, THEY DO NOT CARE!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was great, ready to use, almost no damage. One very small scratch on the screen, doesn’t seem to effect the phone at all. We put a screen protector on it, and it’s been just as if we bought it brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Stoked about this new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo funcional."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Camera should be better. It freezes sometimes."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter loves it and the color is cute"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My husband is not very techie. He only wants a phone that works and did not want to pay a high price for a new IPhone. The warranty is good on this and he is just fine with a refurbished one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is aweful"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone arrived earlier than expected. I am almost 82 and I was able ON MY OWN set up the new phone and transfer all the data from my older phone to the new. I'm very happy with my Iphone 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall the phone is nice but little things like me constantly getting notifications because the screen was repaired not at an apple facility or my AirPods breaking up and disconnecting constantly (when they are new and it worked just fine on my old phone) those things annoy me anything else is fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sorry I submitted a little message saying I didn’t receive it but it was in my mailbox 😂 thought Amazon would’ve delivered it. Product looks good though. Appreciate what you guys do keep it up!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's a good buy, but the charger didn't work."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfecto intacto prácticamente, envío súper rápido, batería al 87% de vida, lo demás todo perfecto no hay quejas!! Recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far this has been a great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 While to the eye it's alright at first impression, the phone is has a lot of issues. The ""like new"" description, and the overall positive reviews of a renewed device seemed promising. However the device I received was COVERED in scratches, it hadn't even been wiped off it seems.

The top volume button as well is sticky, I don't believe this device was even cleaned. In the era of COVID, that's a bit concerning. If it weren't for the hardware inside working alright this would've been a total flop.

While I am glad to have an IPhone, I am not glad to have had the wrong idea from the plethora of reviews of the Renewed service. I thought I would be receiving a ""Like New"" product, not a Iphone that was just chucked out.

Overall, it's a good phone. The renewed service however needs some work. At the very least cleaning should've been done."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is fully unlocked and it's really nice."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this refurbished. It was in excellent condition except for 3 small chips to screen. I paid $500 and it is well worth it. Why buy a new version when you can wait a year and buy a refurbished one for half the price?"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is too big"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I first got it, came with an android charger. Something was already off about it when I logged into my iCloud account, said something was unfamiliar w one of the parts inside the phone, talked to Apple to see what they could do about the error message that kept popping up & they couldn’t do anything. Later I noticed the corner of the screen lifting WHILE it was in the heavy duty phone case & with the screen protector on. Fell out my hand once n the entire screen popped out & screen went black… this bitch alone is too heavy in my pocket & w a fat case around it for protection makes it even heavier. Battery life doesn’t last a full 8 hr shift. Just go to Apple my guy, save yourself some time & money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Outside of the fact that the screen is VERY fragile I give this a 5/5 ! It came faster than I expected only 2-3 days and was in perfect condition totally unlocked you could put any SIM card in"
"Apple","iPhone 11","** 6/10 update: the screen has chipped in multiple places from just being in my pocket due to the screen protruding from the fame.**6/7 (date of delivery) the functionality of the phone works overall really well, but i assume the screen had been broken before refurbishing. the new screen on it is protruding from the frame of the phone itself. i bought a protective case and screen protector for it before i got it, and regardless of me having both on, i dropped it one time and due to the protrusion it chipped the screen even with the screen protector on. i won't be buying from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Is my fist time buying a renewed item I paid $400 plus taxes I got this iPhone for my 13 years-old boy. First things he saw was scratches on the back and the sides also some spots on the camara lenses but it was used already we thought was ok. Then he found out the speaker sounded bad the camara flash didn't work until a few shots it was like on/off but what made him feel disappointed was the battery life not even 80%. The only thing he liked was the color ""red"". I will return it as soon as possible."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ain’t even gon cap I was a lil scared to buy this thinking imma get scammed or something but it’s better then what I expected easy set up works and looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Device was so dirty that I hardly couldn’t hear the word. The next day I was to use the service for sending the item back was so costly that I spent some extra money. Shame, the seller!Would say, there wasn’t any refurbishment."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my second purchase of a revamped iPhone from Amazon. So far, so good, great price, & I have 90 days to return if something goes bad!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto parece nuevo.Excelente vendedor.Muy recomendable!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It’s supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost iPhone into this phone and it wouldn’t work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won’t have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No charge battery I want to return this product ever time battery ishu."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Teléfono en buen estado, todo funcionando, liberado de fábrica"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Never again! I bought this phone “unlocked”. My service provider could not activate it, could not repair the defective speaker, that should not have been defective in the first place & another specialty repair place also could do nothing to fix the phone. So after throwing good money after bad, I was stuck with a defective phone. Tried to return the phone but was told I could not return it. Managed to get it activated eventually & have to use ear buds or speaker phone function to use the phone. The Face ID does not work due to the speaker issue. Very, very disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like that the phone looks like new, is fully unlocked (can work on any networt) while supporting LTE. It also fully functional.However, its keeps bring a notification that the screen is not genuine and has very poor battery health of 73%.I think the seller should have stated these major drawback so that the buyer makes an informed decision"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone looks great , functions as expected,. Battery says 85% but its shot, drops fast. I have to charge it twice a day."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in great condition. The only dent or scratch was on the screen and it’s nail thin and very hard to even spot. The battery health is 81% which is definitely on the lower end, but the battery last a good amount of time before I have to recharge the phone. I would recommend others to purchase as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone but I noticed the Len on camera was cracked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had to put into dfu mode with a cable and my Mac to be able to get it to come back. Returned it and had to order elsewhere due to them being out of this model"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous however, phone arrived just about brand new. Glass had no imperfections, phone had no scratches. No internal issues, sound, quick loss of battery. Functions as a new phone.I'm pleasantly surprised"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is in perfect working condition. & at a Great price, I am happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased thus phone for my daughter and she loves it. Not only does it look brand new it also works like it's brand new. My daughter only orders her phones from this seller and she's always pleased with her purchases."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It pares up with my hearing aids . Music shuts off when someone calls and starts again when you end call Super quality with both calls and music."
"Apple","iPhone 11","iPhone came in perfect condition. No scratches or damage. Works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono venía en muy buenas condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","What I like is that the iPhone came in lest then 4 days. Came fully unlocked and ready. With a great battery Health and the phone works Just fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was quite surprised by the high quality of the device I received. It came in a timely manner. It arrived in a better condition that I expected. I’ve had it a couple weeks now and seems to be working well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My opinion of this is great! Great customer service, phone looks new, only a few tiny scratches by the charger port-Unnoticeable!! Very satisfied. Thank you!! Treasa Welch"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone was delivered earlier than expected! It was packaged well and looks brand new! No damages or scratches. Battery life is great. The phone came with a charger and key to open the sim tray. Definitely worth it!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó en excelente condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon it’s quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was sold a stolen phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looks like it’s brand new !! What I like is I got a very nice phone for very reasonable price I definitely do it again !! It works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","4 stars because there were a few tiny scratches on the screen but everything else was in good condition. Got exactly what I ordered. Battery capacity at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Upgraded from 8 Plus Love face recognition and size easy to hold"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything worked ok but the camera, which was the main reason I wanted the phone, did not unfortunately. The second I opened the camera you could hear this loud clicking sound and it was incredibly blurry and out of focus the entire time no matter what setting I tried. Also when I went to see my return options the only option was to refund me instead of to replace the phone. Now I have to wait 30 days until I get a refund and order another phone and hope that it works. Really, really disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had this phone for a few days, and everything seems to work great! The battery life came at 86% But I can go with the whole day without charging it! At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isn’t even any scratches or marks that I can notice. This package was delivered on time and it even came with a charger and a cube (not apple products but still work just the same). So glad I was able to save some money!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really shocked I could purchase on Amazon but got it quick and works perfectly! Very happy and look forward to more purchases"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it to use for work so I could stop running my regular phone in the ground.But the battery only lasted about 1 hour before it would go dead every day.Had to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered my phone on wednesday and it came on friday. i love it. i set it up checked all the important things like system speed, speakers, flashlight, front and back camera and i even airdropped a picture to see how fast it would download, it works perfectly fine for now, i’ll try to update if anything happens. it doesn’t have any cracks or scratches. i would definitely recommend. i read the reviews and i was kinda scared but it turned out just fine. and i’ll also try to update with results of battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works, it was easy to setup. No issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No scratches anywhere"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had poor battery life and scratchy audio that was a defect with the renewed iPhone-just be aware that should you return within 90 days you may not get 100% refund which is much different than what is written and I quote “ If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us within 90 days of receipt of your original purchase (or within 1 year of receipt of a Renewed Premium product) at Amazon Renewed via the above options. You can request either a full refund or a replacement unit if one is available - your choice.” End of quote."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in great condition, exactly what I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition and all of the above"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got it like new. Perfect condition. Thank you so much. Battery was at 85% but it's okay."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was satisfied with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great! Have had for 6 months now, no issues.One minor kink is that blue tooth will fall out all of a sudden. But that seems to be only thing, which is totally fine. Great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good phone I did not even now it was renewed because there were no cracks or anything. I recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La batería marca capacidad máxima de 75% y pide mantenimiento. O sea que debe ser cambiada.En la descripción aseguraban mínimo 80% de capacidad. El teléfono no tiene rayones y el táctil funciona."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works fine but if you have boost and try to use this phone it won’t work I switched back to metro by T-Mobile so that I can use it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Trustworthy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is a good value compared to new phones and looks like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I’ll give them props for that! Just got the “exchange” item. IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%. The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That’s why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I’ve learned my lesson."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No headphones set provided."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No complaints, just wished it came with a good charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First it started with heavy power button then the screen shut off. I find it hard to hold in my hand as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Immediately upon opening the box the phone was dirty. There is dirt and even someone’s HAIR clogging the front speaker. There is dirt in the sound switch and all around the camera. The battery health is also very poor and the same as my phone I had before this one. Not to mention the dents around the bottoms speakers. At least all the dirt can be cleaned but there isn’t anything I can do to fix the crappy battery health it came with. Kind of disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is so amazing, with great battery life, and everything works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Please don’t listen to what other people say. The reviews almost made me not buy. My daughter just received her phone it is everything yes it is worth the money 💰 I’m about to order me one. Gamer is nice, it’s loud and brand new we love love love it so much"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I absolutely love this! It connected to my carrier right away and it had no dings or cracks or anything. I was definitely skeptical about buying an “unlocked” phone online but I’m glad I did. The battery life is at 88% which is still good and it’s nothing to get a new battery when it comes time for that. But otherwise, I’m super happy with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto está en perfectas condiciones, la vida útil de la batería llegó con un 93%, llegó en una caja genérica pero muy bien empacado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone's battery is terrible. It came in as a maximum capacity of 77%. That's worse than my old phone. Phone gets really hot quick do to this issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Work great for my mothers hearing aid"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My biggest disappointment was the battery life. It came at 86% and by the time I downloaded the IOS 15 update it went down to 81% 👎 Was hard for the phone to keep charge after that. Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful. Thought the seller I choose would have been a better purchase for me as they had so much 5 stars...guess not"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in pristine conditions can not tell it was ever used. I love it and so much better than the 8+ I had"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the screen was very scratched, I did not even turn it on, I think it would be a good idea to add an option to select the condition of the phone, I think that there are refurbished in good condition and excellent,You can maybe add those options with different prices for each one, so it is not random."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen producto, sin marcas ni daños externor visibles o palpables, batería al 100%de vida."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i’ve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I think they gave me great service and the next time I buy a phone I am using the Amazon renewed service!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product so far I’ve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month it’s been a little over a week and it’s been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever I’ll keep you updated however.Continued: about a month later idk I’ve been having connectivity issues. It isn’t that big of a deal but it’s too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but I’ll probably end up getting a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Theres nicks on the top right corner of the phone from it being dropped and the battery condition is at 89%. Definitely disappointed and wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy one if you expect it to be in excellent condition even if it says thats what you’re getting."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do Not Buy.Do Not Buy from Chubbiestech.Took the time to set the entire phn up only to discover the camera was internally broken -- lines through the viewing image and visible after pic taken. Returned.*Update -- it's been 17days since the date the item was returned and i still haven't Received my money back. Maddening.**Update -- 29days now and still no money back. Bill is due. To avoid paying interest on credit card, must pay bill in full.Amazon says i will receive money back within 7days.If I'm late paying bill, or don't pay full balance i pay penalty or interest. Same back if Amazon is late with refund.Amazon delivered $10 gift card for compensation. This is fair."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First this thing came lightning fast to my doorstep. I ordered it 4pm CST on a Wednesday and it was in my hand by 1pm CST the very next day. Not even 24 hours! Bravo! When it did show up my VERY picky teenage step-daughter began to put it through its paces immediately. It's been 7 days now and I haven't heard a single complaint about the battery being dead, and she is literally on her phone 12 hours a day. She loves the camera too. It also came with a charger which seems to be a hot commodity in this household, and they even put a tempered glass screen protector on it for us. 1st rate service at half the price Apple wants for one still in the box!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sending it back . No speaker and volume"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Some of the letters on the leyboard sont work other than that ut works"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The company that bought this phone bought a stolen phone therefore the phone was reported locked to the carriers. The had to take it to get fixed and payed an extra 50 dollars. Other than that, the phone works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","this was a present for a friend so I can give no input."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this iPhone perfect size. Phone came to me looked like it was brand new. There was not a make on it and it works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The sound while talking on speaker phone is terrible quality. You can barley hear the person on the other end or be heard from others."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you so much for the delivery and works amazingly ... please though be careful with packaging,found a few scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent battery life! Have not tried fingerprint reader or Face recognition yet. Extremely happy with the function of the phone overall."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Un poco maltratado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived looking good, no scratches, battery condition was barely over what they say at 82% all was going well, had a facetime call, so speaker phone worked.... then I tried to make a phone call. Ear speaker would not work. volume maxed, no sound. Easy return! got my refund and now will look elsewhere. First time with renewed phone, and will be my last. Probably got a bad one I know, its ok. The refund was quick and pretty fast once the phone showed received at the sellers address. Worth a gamble, its a numbers game. This time didnt work out for me, no problem."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won’t take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I’m aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It’s like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it’s a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It’s well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in great shape, battery seems to hold a charge very well. I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the “accessory not supported” notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although don’t count on the accessories."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone just arrived 1 day earlier than expected. Everything updated and transferred from my old iPhone perfectly fine. The battery life is at 87% capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Best refurbished phone I’ve ever bought!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Easy to get started installs like a breeze wonderful memory Great Phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","battery life was 85% decent but can do better 100% recommend this device"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter absolutely loves her new phone no cracks it even came with a screen protector and a chargerShe was so excited 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I Give this a 5 star so far no signs of use its unlock to my network in saint lucia and works as it should"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old son and he is very pleased with this gift which is not an easy feat. iPhones are really good phones in general and I am happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Several noticeable scratches on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived well packaged with charger. Looked brand new--not a mark on it. Worked perfectly from the get go and a month later no issues or glitches. Teenage granddaughter is on it constantly and no complaints about battery life. Would definitely buy agsin."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is a product worth buying. The overall condition the phone was when first taken out the box was amazing. Not a visible scratch, great battery life, all features working. Seems like it was brand new from a carrier. Absolutely satisfied with it. Looking forward to buy from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me agradó porque no tuve problemas para su configuración. Lo compré para llevarlo a claro Centroamérica y muy bueno."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","100% battery and looks brand new. Very happy and did not expect the battery to be new, especially since it was a renewed phone and not renewed premium."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono funciona perfecto, reconocimiento facial y bateria excelente, tiene un detalle importante en una de las esquinas, pero eso no afecta su uso, elResto impecable, gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So right it's good. Given its refurbished, I understand the battery not being 100% but the only issue I could think of is the charger port. I'm having it looked at soon. Overall 9.3/10 would recommend buying most definitely."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it for my son who broke his last one. He's very happy with it. It was in prefect shape and the battery life is excellent so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in good shape. No issues so far. No scratches, dents, or missing glass in the screen. Works well. Battery seems to hold pretty good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Worked like a charm, no mistakes"
"Apple","iPhone 11","iPhone came as describe and works well. Noticed some little bumps at the bottom of the screen but nothing bad and knew some minor imperfections were bound to come with the phone. Battery was at 83% capacity which is good. Just wish the phone was packaged better because it was clanging around in the box and could have caused potential damage to the phone during shipment."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my iPhone when I got it there was nothing wrong with it no scratches no cracks or dents and most importantly no water damage everything works fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very scared to order a renewed phone but I was in such need of a new iPhone. I love the iPhone 11 I got, it works extremely fast and the battery capacity is at 100%.. there’s a couple of scratches at the top of the iPhone but it’s not doing anything harmful to the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looks and works great...as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is beautiful got it activated and everything but one small problem I noticed was that when I have my dark mode on you can see a blue mark in the middle of the phone wish I didn’t have that problem but I won’t replace it unless the screen gets worse. Ps I received it like that be careful everyone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I received the phone, it was filthy! The speakers were full of dirt and grime and the whole phone looked like it had never been cleaned. It came with a phone screen protector and when I went to peel it off (as I had ordered a new one) it was super gummy and the phone was covered in glue. This phone was NOT cleaned by amazon as promised and the phone screen was very scratched up. I cleaned it myself and the scratches are not too noticeable once I put the new screen protector on it. The phone works fine but it was a bummer to receive it not in the condition that was promised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone and received it damaged, the speaker was very messed up. So i asked for help and they sent me a new one free of charge and told me to dispose of the first one so I did. All was well and customer service was amazing. After a month of waiting (I’m a prime member, I shouldn’t have had to wait that long), I received the phone and it had already been used!!! The phone had a password on it and other settings on it!! I immediately contacted amazon and the people I spoke to were extremely rude and didn’t give very much help, they were very hard to understand aswell. I finally was able to just get a refund, but they expected me to ship them this phone back! That is not my job, I’m not paying to ship this thing back! And now I don’t even have a phone that I’m in very much need of. Very disappointing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you so much I love my new iPhone everything is working well no problems 😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It will overheat and sometimes the screen had delayed reaction, Other than that it works fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 It doesn’t have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it’s a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," It doesn’t have fingerprint sensor battery life is good I was having issues with the face recognition or I probably just need to reset but it’s a great phone no problems or complications since I bought it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono decía que está excelente sólo está bien a secas, se inive un poco,se nota bastante que es usado, pero en fin , esperaba algo mucho mejor☹️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's a good phone lots of features and functions don't think it's worth the price tho."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love how fast the phone is and camera is so clear. But the battery dies quick. My IPhone XR lasts way longer so I’m gonna have to replace the battery soon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent IPhone 11 Brand new condition very good battery health Very good seller Five star ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little skeptical at first cause of the price but this phone cause 4 days early and the batter was at 95%! No scratches or anything practically looked brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very happy with this purchase. Looks and works like new. Packaged well and shipped fast! Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It took 5 working days to get to South Africa,and im happy with everything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was a gift for my daughter and her only complaint was a dead spot in the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with a screen protector and in decent condition. Only scratches were paint around the camera. But pretty much brand new looking! Ordering another for family!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great so far! Came in the next day. Really happy with the phone ! I will definitely recommend to anyone !!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen equipo como nuevo sin detalles trajo protector de pantalla batería en buen estado y Face ID funcional"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in good shape, fully functional but it's clear that the battery was never checked as it clearly states that the battery life warrants a replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was unlocked and i could move it to my provider easy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had the iphone 7 that started to show signs of failure. I wanted a bigger screen and an upgraded camera but didn't want to pay the $1000 plus dollars for it. I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wish the battery life was better but overall the phone is great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was sold this phone that has a not good battery quality which will eventually result in me having to replace the battery I also was told by the guy who just fixed my screen that whoever owned this phone previously took out the speaker screens probably when they were cleaning them so that will cause issues for me in the future to because it’s now easier for things to get trapped in there

Y’all really should not be allowed to sell phones like this"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone was pristine. Long battery life, great purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great replacement phone. I always shop through Amazon before going to an actual phone store"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There is a blur on the startup screen. There are also several scratches on the screen and the camera. This phone is not in good shape. I will be returning this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far I'm pretty happy with the phone, I definitely prefer it over Android phones. I don't have to use fingerprint reader so that's why the low review on that. Only drawback I can't use my own ringtone/text message tones. My boyfriend tried to and he said it was difficult. I had to read up a little bit on how to use the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El micrófono no funciona bien. Las grabaciones quedan con un ruido. Es necesario utilizar manos libres."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was super scared at first but glad I took a chance"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The Battery is sooo good the phone is little new to me so im still working with it but everything else is beautiful I love it and it was unlocked im happy with my product ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in acceptable shape. There was a light scuff on the upper left of the screen, but placing screen protector on it caused it not to be seen. I was able to transfer data from my Android phone, but when testing a phone call was unable to hear the person whom I called, even with the volume set all the way up. The speaker box had normal sound. I requested a return and the vendor is cooperating."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looked like new, not even a scratch. And it works a treat. Synergy Smartphones rock!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything seems to be working perfectly fine, no cracks, or damage to the phone when delivered, and everything was just the way I wanted it to seem"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping! I was kinda bummed it came with only 89% battery life-I’m jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack. Love the facial recognition-wait… there’s a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Most of the phone worked, but without it not reading my SIM card, it's useless, and a very expensive paper weight. I took the phone to AT&T and they confirmed by trying two brand new SIM cards that it was indeed the phone and not the card."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It has turned out to be a great phone, Colorado, all settings very responsive and good battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11","We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall I’m very pleased with my newest purchase from this seller! I upgraded my phone from a 6s to this Unlocked 11. It made a world of difference (clearly lol). Setup and Transfer of my data/photos from my old phone to this one was painless. For those that are using Metro PCS by T Mobile or a similar carrier save yourself some time and frustration and call customer service or login in to your personal account and ACTIVATE your unlocked device to your current account. Will definitely purchase from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was like new. No scratches at all and it works perfectly. I am so happy with this purchase since I was a bit skeptical in the beginning. I’m glad I made the purchase after all 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great value, screen sometimes doesn’t want to operate like it freezes up sometimes and I have to close out of the app I was in or sometimes it’s slow a little but I can live with it. Everything is in perfect working order and screen is in great condition came with a screen protector. Awesome phone, wish the battery life was a little longer though, last maybe two-three hours using it. Checking my phone and going on every now and then last about ten hours, so not too bad."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have been on the search for a new phone forever and finally found the 11 and am so happy with it! i absolutely love the phone and the color!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La mejor decisión, el celular estaba como nuevo física y internamente la batería 100%, y todo funciona a la perfección."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Please stop false advertising to get sales if it’s not truly unlocked just say that now my little sister has to pay to get her phone unlocked. But other than that her phone came in good condition so I only knocked off two stars."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Happy with the product except for the fact that I came with a battery health of 88%. I know they only guarantee a minimum health of 80%, but of all the refurbished phones I’ve gotten in the past, this one is the lowest health I’ve ever seen. All my others have been around 95-97%. It kind of sucks to get a new-to-me phone and know I’m going to have to drop more money on a new battery soon"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular vino en excelentes condiciones físicas, lo único que me desmotiva es el nivel de la batería, vino en 83% sin embargo tenía claro que había una gran posibilidad de que llegara con ese por ciento, ya que lo indica las características; fuera de eso estoy muy contenta con la compra y el artículo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works well…worth every penny and more."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got it for a great price I can’t tell at all it was pre owned"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall, it was good, but it had a corner that was scratched up. Other than that, it is a pretty good device."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The front-facing camera looked scratched and any photos taken with the front camera were very fuzzy and out of focus. The face ID recognition didn't work either. The rest of the phone seemed to work fine, but I was very disappointed by the front camera quality and returned it immediately."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Better than i thought was pretty scared at first but yes!!! NOT A SCAMMMM also i have 87% battery couldve been better but okkkkk"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was time for an upgrade and this phone fits my needs."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I didn't get the refund. The cellphone always shut down for no reason."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Acceptable performance for the price. Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone battery life is great, the phone is fast and responsive couldn’t be happier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have been going back and fourth about whether or not I should return this phone. I did my research and the 11 seemed like the best, affordable upgrade from my 8 plus. That being said, when it arrived today it was in less than ""excellent"" condition. For starters, the screen was pretty scratched when I looked at it under light. This doesn't show up when the phone and display are on, but it definitely worried me. In addition, the packaging was pretty sloppy and just came in a plastic sleeve in a cardboard box. That being said, the max capacity of battery is actually still 100% which is why I think I will still keep the phone. Buy with caution!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered the 11 because I needed a new phone and without a doubt this was the best price for one.
Shipped pretty fast and when it arrived it didn’t come in normal Apple packaging which I expected.
Phone works perfectly but main complaint I had was the battery life wasn’t at 100, not too big of a deal, another complaint was there was a screen protector put on but it was pretty poorly installed doesn’t really effect anything just a little annoying.
Personally I would recommend you to buy this as the phone came in amazing basically new condition and with the price I really can’t complain."
"Apple","iPhone 11","arrived quickly and working perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didn’t know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering it’s refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasn’t too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen was popping out"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone had %90 battery health and came with a screen protector. It's looking good so far. Recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m always a bit skeptical when buying electronics online, but I’m overall happy with my purchase! Purchase the iphone unlocked, it arrived unlocked. Just popped my SIM card in and had no problems. Obviously it’s refurbished, but it seemed like new. Just had a few scratches on the front and back (not really noticeable unless you look for them) and the battery health was at 91%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El único detalle fue unos rayones pero son pequeños de ahí en mas el dispositivo es una maravilla"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was given a nice phone, it would be amazing, but it is not unlocked for AT&T. The phone says 'SIM not Supported' when it tries to activate with an AT&T SIM working in a current AT&T plan phone. I've tried two of my AT&T SIMs now.

My AT&T SIM will not activate so I cannot use the phone, it might as well be a brick right now.. I've bought several other iPhones from this merchant that worked right away with my other AT&T SIMS, but they did not setup this one properly to activate with AT&T.

Please contact me on how to fix your product so I can activate my SIM, or send me a replacement ASAP."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Haven’t noticed anything wrong with phone in 3 months so far, battery seems brand new and camera looks good. A lot of space for cheap too. Mine started by charging really slow but I wouldn’t worry about that because the phone was probably powered off for awhile. Also I would buy a better charger this comes with a generic charger and with no phone box."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was perfect.. thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in perfect condition! Works great, was 100% unlocked. The only downside would be the settings say it can only charge to 84%. So that kind of stinks. But other than that, not bad!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My primary phone - saved me a lot of money - have not found anything below my expectations."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased a iphone 11 from this company. The phone came in a timely manner an look awesome. Went to activate the phone an was told by apple it was reported stolen. This company promised me a refund once they got the product back. I returned it the next day after receiving it. They called because it was locked out an demanded me to give them the apple id. It wasnt mine how could i give them the information. They refused to refund me luckily Amazon stepped in an helped me out. Moral to the story spend alittle more an buy new. A new one cost me $70 more but totally worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","faulty speaker"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works well so far minor cracks but activation was very easy and not that long."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn’t get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn’t even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","looks New. you can not imagine that it is renewed item. thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren’t any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I’m an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I’m pleased to say that this device feels great but, it’s still an iPhone and to that, I mustn’t give a full 5 star review. Android gang."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery could be better but at 86% i cant complain to much and needs less scratches on the back to get a full 5 star review"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo llegó como nuevo, ninguna rayadura, la batería dura bastantes horas. Muy buena compra :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone came in 4 days!! Also with 89% battery health and no scratches or cracks. Everything works well and set was easy. I would highly recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","IT IS AMAZING LITERALLY ITS THE BEST I WAS A LITTLE SCARED ABOUT BUYING THIS BUT IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST👍 RECOMMEND"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I would strongly recommend and buy again!!! The packaging wasn’t its finest but it got the job done with no damage"
"Apple","iPhone 11","i was extremely nervous to buy a phone online, but this phone is well worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was hopeful that the phone would be somewhat decent but it really scratched up. I drop my current IPhone all the time but it doesn’t look like that. Looks like an old phone that never used screen protector. Decided to just pay extra $100 and buy a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the battery health is low and the phone came with a lot of damages"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've tried new keyboards nothing will work. Part of the keys on keyboard doesn't work."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came super fast and works perfect! Also it looks brand new. Battery life is a little eh but nothing significant. Overall very happy with this entire process."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phones speed , cameras quality increased with different features .More memory capability than my previous iPhone Xmax (Rosegold) Appreciate this phone and like it very much"
"Apple","iPhone 11","an expensive feeling phone for an inexpensive price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My teen daughter loves this phone!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came like new from apple….perfect condition!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The batter came with 86% capacity. Everything else is excellent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good condition and an excellent price!! Not a mark on it and will definitely purchase again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just received but it’s definitely like new and unlocked a bit pricey for refurbished"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice iphone just a battery health on 75% but so far all good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This isn’t worth the price tbh. Battery don’t last and phone screen scratched"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am satisfied with this product, it also comes with a charger and screen protector. Just a minor scratch noticed on the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this iphone 11 as a replacement/upgrade. It was unlocked and clean. No complaints whatsoever. It works and looks like a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone in perfect conditions!! Very happy with my new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Producto en excelentes condiciones fisicas, con un mes de garantía, batería al 99%, sin rayones, cámara y pantalla en excelente estado. Imei original, totalmente desbloqueado y funcional para las redes móviles en Colombia. Caja y cargador genérico marca LG, cable lightnin apple y entrega en el tiempo estimado, incluso un día antes de lo previsto. En general, muy buena experiencia de compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo genial. Igual que nuevo. Liberado para Costa Rica."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So it works, it's a phone, it texts and calls and takes pictures and goes on the internet. But it's pretty glitchy and slow and the screen broke right away so I couldn't return it. Also came with a big weird glob of glue on the flash. Anyway you get what you pay for and I'm not wholly unsatisfied. The last refurbished iphone I got worked great and lasted years so it is what it is. I just hope the condition doesn't further deteriorate over time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to switch to apple from Android. Phone came in with a few scratches on the body and the battery was at 87%, so it was in pretty good condition. Only returned it because iOS isn't my thing. Comes with a SIM tool and a 10W generic charger. I think the phone is supposed to come with 18W, but it's a good backup charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a very good purchase and the seller met our expectation."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Compré este teléfono para un regalo que tenia que enviar a una amiga, el teléfono decía que era de calidad ""excelente"" es decir grado A, sin embargo tenía dos rayas en la pantalla y una lateral. La vida útil de la batería no era óptima. Ellos mismos colocaron un protector para disimular las rayas y aún así se veían. No quiero ni pensar en que estado venden los otros grados. Una estafa."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only thing wrong with it is that there is a crack in one of the camera lenses.Otherwise it looked practically new. It came with a case, a screen protector, a tool to open the sim card, and an off brand charging cable. Overall it was a great deal."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s a refurbished phone I don’t mind that it didn’t come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it’s my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it’ll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was hesitant about buying this but I definitely recommend! They phone came with a screen protector already on it, and a charger as well. It’s been fantastic! There were no scratches or dents. It is in really good condition and I’m super happy I made this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice color, good outer condition but the phone screens shuts down while your on a call and makes it difficult to end the phone call, screen just keeps flickering and there’s nothing you can do but wait. audio also sometime goes in and out and makes it hard to hear on video calls too. Not enjoyable at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It looks like new. No scratches. Battery health 89%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The description said it will come in a white boxThe item came in a plastic bag !!!NO BOX"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived with a deep scratch on the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the first one and the back was shattered but the company made it right and got me a better one within 2 weeks."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Disappointed with product. The volume sounds poor and 24hrs after using it message notified me battery needs replacing . I priced battery it will be another 100.00. The poor reviews this seller has is very true . I will likely switch my services back to my old phone and return the I -11. Very disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came like a new , just the price dropped about 10% or more after a week of purchased 🤣🤣. Well anyways very good deal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in great shape but Boost Mobile would not recognize the IMEI number, so it had to be returned. Return process was very easy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It one of my best purchases ever!! it came in a box and it looked like new. I couldn't find any scratches even being used. It came with a compatible charger and the key to open the sim card compartment. It works amazingly. Totally recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is one of the best."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works good as new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My dauther was very happy with it, thats all it matters to me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had no issues with my iphone, it was completely unlocked and in tact"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in folded fedex bag inside of a box the same size of the phone, wrapped in bubble wrap. Not the worst packaging, but was a tad worried about integrity of phone. So put that into consideration if you want to. Phone had 100% battery life, setup and SIM card transfer was instant and easy. Great and snappy phone, was worth buying a refurbished version. Only thing I can truly complain about is that when I took off the provided screen protector off to put an expensive one I bought there were very visible scratches all over the screen. Other than that, if you’re into saving about $400 and don’t mind a refurbished product, this phone is for you."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Señores el teléfono tebia tosa la pantalla rallada ..... y decía en la receña que venia remanofacturado como nuevo fue un regalo a mi sobrina y que decepción se llevó. Que mal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s just difficult too read due to it’s size. I have to turn it sideways in Oder to read and accurately type."
"Apple","iPhone 11","We had problems with these people from the beginning. First they sent us a defective phone, then when we asked for them to send a replacement, they claimed that they could not ship to a different address per Amazon - even though I had other products delivered from Amazon to that same address.So, we had to pay for it to be shipped to us since they sent it to the wrong address. Then this new replaced ONLY lasted 4 months - 30 days after Amazon’s warranty expired - before the battery started overheating within 30 minutes of use and then shut off.SO NOT BUT FROM THEM!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was like ehhh I hope this works. Got it as a gift for my boyfriend. The price was great and everywhere else was sold out. We were able to get it all set up with no issues. After a few months, it’s still working just fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived a day after I purchased it. Super fast! The phone is awesome and in excellent condition! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Five months later one of my speakers is broken and my Face ID doesn’t work. Still great battery life though"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I simply love this phone. I would have gave the finger print reader 5 stars but it does not have it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product. In great shape. Had for about 2 months and no problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Item not used delivery date nor honored as advertised even after 2 attempts and long waiting time to answer my call and request"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After about two months of use, the screen started moving by itself while also not registering my touch. It got to the point where the ghost touches were so bad, the phone clicked itself into light mode (I use dark mode) and if I wasn’t careful, would reply gibberish to text messages. I couldn’t use the keyboard at all. Using the screen in any capacity quickly became impossible. I brought my phone to a few repair shops, none of which could help, some even accusing the seller to have replaced some of the inner parts with lesser quality ones. None of the employees could even get the phone into diagnostic mode as the screen kept glitching out. A refurbished phone should last more than two months, especially considering this one cost nearly four hundred dollars.Amazon allowed me to return the iPhone by August 31st"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s okay to have condition was okay only a single issue is that when you’re on a phone call the other person can’t hear you well unless you’re using an earphone/airpods"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Business"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The item has very visible damage on the lower edge of the body and is not in excellent condition. I'm returning it and have already ordered another one with the hope that the new one is really ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is perfect. Like a brand new. Great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works and looks like new. Battery seems new. Much cheaper than a new iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy bueno si por desir exelente bien protegido yedo dos dias antes no tube problema con el rastre enfin bolveria a comprar otro con este vendedor tenia dudas por nocer distribuido por Amazon pero wow muy bien lo isieron"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No marks or scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is not functioning I will be returning"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Since it’s renewed I new what to expect but everything was great! It got here less than a week , only a tiny scratch on the bottom none in front ,back or sides. Then went to see if it was unlocked and it was."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received this phone yesterday. Battery health is at 80%. For some reason, MDM/device management is active on this iPhone. Is it stolen? Still waiting for a reply from the seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Seems to be working great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have been looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 11 for a while. I decided to take a change on the refurbished iPhone 11 (I got mine in black). It arrived sooner than the expected date and the packaging was exactly what I expected, excellent! As for the phone itself it came with an iPhone charger (not from Apple but works great) my iPhone already had a screen protector on it and the battery life was at 100. It worked just as well as you would buy one from Apple. No dents or scratches. I would 10/10 recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly, everything about the phone was great! It came with a scratch or two but I'm okay with that knowing its renewed. Would buy from here again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Work and looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Vida útil de la barita 85 muy bajo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Hello. I really liked the phone, and I have no complain about its operation. However, I bought the phone but I live in Angola and I didn't know that it was locked for att.I know its my fault, and I'm really sad because I can't use the phone right now.Can you help me?I tried to unlock it on att website, but they ask me for the first phone contact associated with the phone, and I don't have that information."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only issue I have seen with the phone is that one of the speakers doesn't work. Bought for my son he says everything else seems to work fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Extremely happy with this purchase from Avant"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Personal use"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I normally don’t write reviews but I had to honest best phone I ever brought and I can’t believe it’s not new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in like brand new. I’ve been using it for over a month now and it works like brand new. It’s definitely worth the money, and exceeded my expectations. There were no visible or harsh scratches or damage to it when it arrived, and compared to my iPhone 6, the battery life is long. There are plenty of reasons to buy a refurbished phone; money saving and reusing is one of them. I’d say go for it if you really want to."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in very good condition. All was as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 11","DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE BOOST OR SPRINT, but other than that the phone works perfect it looks brand new I deff recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good still trying to learn the features on the phone but no issues phone came packaged well Thanks guys"
"Apple","iPhone 11","As someone who solely lives off service industry tips buying a new phone was super risky. I took the chance on buying a refurbished phone and it was my best financial decision I’ve made :) It’s practically brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone to buy, small scratches but not noticeable. Came with 100% battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11","more than happy with this phone, it exceeded my expectations"
"Apple","iPhone 11","What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition is great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It doesn't come with 80percent battery but it was in fantastic shape I would 💯 recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone seemed great! But the battery just wouldn’t stay charged and took a long time to get charged. We took it in to replace the battery and they encouraged us to trade phones. But Amazon was fabulous to work with and we would definitely buy a phone from them again in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was not cleaned I was moving dirt from around the camera area."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is mediocre. It has scratches on the screen. And the internet just randomly stops working to where I have to restart the phone to get it to start working again. Other than that it is ok."
"Apple","iPhone 11","la cámara es muy buena, saca fotos con muy poca luz."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived on time, and looked like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the phone in an Amazon box, well packaged. I’ve put my Nigerian sim which works well, so it’s fully unlocked. Battery life is 97% which is good. No scratches and phone perfectly works well. Looks like new and good buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is on 85% when I got this phone never had a renewed phone battery percentage be that low. I’m hoping that the battery will last me for a year or until i get a new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone looked new and worked a little over 4 months and then started getting real hot and cutting off within 5 mins of use. Battery swelled up and split the phone. Took it to a repair shop where we were notified that it was unfixable. The battery in it was not apple and was installed incorrectly therefore overheated and fried the circuit board and many other parts of the phone. Fingerprint and face recognition never worked also."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just didn't like the battery"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The good this about the phone is that is doesn’t looked used at all and works perfectly fine. The bad thing is it’s Black Listed and I can’t get it activated. The customer service isn’t the best either. Instead of them offering a new phone , they only offered a refund when all I wanted is for the to get the phone off the Black List. Won’t ever be purchasing anything from them again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","All"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La verdad que al ser un telefono renovado pude recuperar toda la informacion de otro iphone lo que es genial aun no puedo hablar de la bateria lo estoy cargando, venia cin algunos raspones pero con una proteccion no se notaran, por el momento estoy feliz, dire algo mas cuando lo prube mas dias funciona muy bien en chile"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not a phone slave so after two days still have 48% battery."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this phoneVery cool featuresEven better price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the phone, brand new conditions, I didn’t see any problems. Great battery life. Like I can be on 1% and still use my phone no problems. Came quickly. I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. I’ve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if that’s a phone issue or a gmail issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Multiple nicks on the case around the screen, leading me to believe the phone has had a hard life. Not protected with a case of a screen protector. Scratches and blemishes on screen as well as the back . Seems to function decently. First thing I did was put on a case and screen. I’m not convinced of the 80% battery life , After a low usage day it needs charging.I’m on the fence . Can’t send a picture of the phone due to , well you know taking a pic of it is impossible"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good, No cracks or anything visible. Def recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived as perfect condition and works as new. Very pleased with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Complete trash. They only “refurbish” it well enough for it to likely work past the 90 day warranty and then it craps out. We didn’t drop the phone, it didn’t get wet. Nothing. No cracks, dents- nothing from us and the screen all of a sudden starting going out. Just a huge black line across the screen, and the longer you leave the phone on- the more black lines appear until the screen is completely black. The phone is completely unusable and it’s clearly an eternal issue. I messaged the seller and they were totally unreasonable and unhelpful. Fasted $400+ dollars I’ve ever wasted, for sure."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo funciona correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We have had no negative issues with our iphone 11. Works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is the best experience I’ve had with a renewed phone, it comes in anothee box and another charger (I was expecting to buy the fast charge anyways) it comes with a 96% of battery health and just ONE scratch on the back but it is really small, it comes unlocked (or at least you can use it with metro by t-mobile) definitely recommend! Great product! <3"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was delivered fast and works grate"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I thought it’s renewed and looks like new..! But not new (refer my images) price is pretty higher for this. Battery below 90%, shipping speed as usual UPS done faster."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Glitching after a week. Seller was impossible to deal with."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I think it should have come with at least 90-95 percentMine might be defective because I’ve only had it for less than a week and the and the battery health has dropped 3 percent.And I hardly even use the phone …"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone overall, but I wish it wouldn’t die 24/7"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact, I may just be ready to migrate to the ""dark side"" and go get a Pixel 6 next!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Work perfectly fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All was good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it for my 17 year old. He seems to like it ok. But of course he wanted a brand new model. He is spoiled that way."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like that it was here a day early, it scared me when the touch screen didn’t work at first, then by magic it started working when I said I was going to take it back. Been working since then."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it. Ordered yesterday and it was delivered today which is one day earlier than it was suppose to come. Everything is in perfect condition and it worked with metro. I had 0 issues. Switched from iPhone 8 Plus. I was very hesitant on buying because of some of the reviews saying it wasn’t fully unlocked. but I’m glad I bought it. 🙃"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in perfect condition! I was worried because I’ve never bought a used phone before. Very happy with the purchase. Have had phone for several months now and still great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen partly damaged but everything else is fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with 81% battery life and it worked totally fine, but the charger it came with didn't work.Update: I did 15.6 IOS update and it went down to 79%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with a protection screen and great phone. Came fast and included a charger ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That’s a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It’s also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff was eAsy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Cons: degraded batter life (not renewed or refurbished)Pros: cosmetically perfect, in working condition, screen protector. The only factors saving it from a much harsher review."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Can’t even download the update to use it cuz battery was at 20% other than that it’s great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Worked as advertised. As a refurbished iPhone, you are always worried that it may not work as well as a new iPhone. I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall condition and performance of the device. The savings and the warranty were attractive enough for me to take the risk. Based on my experience so far, I would do it again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","You can’t transfer old iPhone to this you have to start it as a brand new but as long as your cloud is backed up you should be straight"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you for the fast shipping. My daughter was very happy. Everything looks great thus far."
"Apple","iPhone 11","so basically chainsawman is a super good super fast paces, almost too fast paces manga!! it geting an anime adaption this december but u can skip the wait for weekly episodes and just read the manga. the mc, denji, comes from an indebted background. his only friend being an odd dog. desperate money he sold his balls."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 I really liked the packaging that the phone came in. Everything was wrapped, and sealed neatly. I would honestly get as much gigabytes as possible so your phone has enough space, and storage. I wasn’t sure if I should buy this phone because it is amazon renewed, but they did a great job. Battery life was perfect, screen and all is functional. Make sure you have a SIM card for the phone. The value is kind of expensive but it’s worth it, also the phone is fully unlocked and that is very important!. Thank you!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was unlocked and work perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical at first but I really want an upgrade coming from the iphone 7 so I bought it it showed up and I unboxed it and I was surprised to find a iPhone 11 no scratches no dents works perfectly I’m using it right now"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen. Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in perfect condition pretty much brand new works perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Usually when you order online there is skepticism regarding quality, this is one purchase I can say was worth the money. It came looking exactly the way it was shown and described (including being unlocked)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Por fuera está muy bien, unos pequeños rayones que no se notan si no te fijas bien, funciona bien, la batería tienen buen rendimiento y carga rápido dependiendo con qué cargador lo pongas, fsce ID super rápido, todo está súper bien por ahora, el UNICO PROBLEMA ES que no me aparece en ajustes WALLET Y APPLE PAY O PASSBOOK Y APPLE PAY , no me da la opción de descargarlo y parece un teléfonos no falso gracias a eso, ahora me resulta difícil pq no puedo tomar el tren y pagar con mi teléfono o pagar en tiendas de manera electrónica, QUIERO UN REEMBOLSO, NO PAGUE TANTO DINERO POR ESTO"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I haven’t owned an iPhone since the first generation. I’ve been an android baby for years since then. That said, they’ve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but it’s definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.

This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am really happy with this purchase it feels like a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came with a non-Apple charger and power adapter which might be different and possibly not good for the phone. I would have preferred an Apple charger and power adapter."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ive talked to several people about this problem. Has been an entire month and they have not given me to money. They customer service is one on the worst. Dont bother. Wasnt able to use thd phone for longer than a week because it dies so fast and the mic next to the front camera dosent work."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good item and in a very good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The refurbished I iPhone 11 I bought stopped getting service three months after I bought it. I contacted my carrier and was told that the original owner had marked the phone as stolen and the phone had been black-listed by the original carrier. Now I have a phone that has no practical function ( can't get service) and the seller has not responded to my request for a replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased an iPhone 11 for my daughter’s birthday when I received it it would not respond to touch. I can’t even turn it back off! And now I’m out $350+ my daughters birthday is in less than 2 weeks and I won’t receive a refund or replacement until after that. This seller is a joke!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No llego como debía estaba golpeado en l parte inferior y lo devolví
Por el precio puse un poco más y compré nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had to contact Apple support because it apparently had multiple Apple IDs on the same device before, so set up was a bit lame, but once i got in, it was smooth as hell. Still can’t believe I got it at such good price. And it even came with a screen protector!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very pleased with my new to me phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone looked and worked like a new one. Battery life was at 85%. Very pleased with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First off I would like to say the phone did work it did fully charged and overall cosmetics was excellent. However I bought this phone because my wife iPhone XR was causing her problems, I bought an unlocked phone so I didn't have to deal with locked GSM. The reader didn't even pick up her SIM card. The phone did not work at all as far as connecting to carrier. I will never buy from this seller again. It could have been just a freak accident however it was a humongous inconvenience."
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was kinda iffy about getting it cause I saw some people said that theirs weren’t unlocked, or it was scratched up, or the sound was bad, but my looks brand new, the sound is great it’s fully unlocked and the battery life is great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looked brand new and the battery health came at 100% which i was very surprised by, but overall it was worth the price. I would definitely buy from this seller again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn’t bother me. It’s something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers. The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better cámara and all new features. I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it. Really happy with it. Thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recently made the switch from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to the IPhone 11 and the phone arrived fast looking practically brand new. No scratches or blemishes. Maximum battery capacity is 85% but this phone holds a charge pretty good. I've had the phone for a month now with no issues. This is my 2nd purchase from this seller and I will buy again in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks and works great the only bad part is that the battery came with a 85% of battery life, not 100% as I would have expected…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El dispositivo llego en una caja de restauracion de amazon, tiene todas las funciones perfectas y estaba liberado para ser usado con cualquiera telefonica a nivel mundial recomiendo comprar estos dispositivos restaurados por amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery good,
When I did insert the SIM card immediately work
Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We were worried but honestly it is so working GREAT. Even the transfer of all our apps, Contacts, Notes, etc were VERY easy to transfer.
So far so good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I gave this to my nephew and he loved it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Picture"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was as expected 100/100"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect product! I was a little worried when first buying this product due to it being refurbished but it works great just like brand new! Not one scratch or mark and if your has one on it, it possibly could have came from the delivery truck or processor rather than the manufacturer. I’m very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to spend 1,000 just on a phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works very well ,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Delivered earlier than it was supposed to be. It is in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected! I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn’t want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it was damaged or not, but I’m happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I’m so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with deep, very visible scratches on the screen and body. The scratches were still visible on the screen when the phone was turned on. Does not even meet the ""acceptable condition"" guidelines of Amazon Renewed, though the product page said the phone would be in excelled condition. Absolutely unacceptable, and will be returned."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I only had one problem. . . WHY DID I GET A BAND NEW DEVICE! I activated it in minutes, No issues and the best part their is no scratches or marks I was regretting my purchase because of all the negative reviews but man am blown away with this device fits better then all my previous Plus max devices"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Literally, the biggest waste of money I've ever received from Amazon. I purchased this phone three weeks ago and it doesn't work. I've been on help with Apple for hours and they can't seem to fix it without sending it into the factory, costing me hundreds of dollars. Had I known the phone I purchased from AMAZON would have been such a problem, I would have gone directly to the Apple Store and saved myself a HUGE headache and a lot of time. BUYER BEWARE...seriously, the phones they sell here are junk and MIGHT get one that works, and then again, you might spend HUNDREDS of dollars to wind up with something that doesn't work and you'll end up sending it to apple to get repaired. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery. DO NOT BUY."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this used phone for my daughter. It was in perfect condition. She loves it. Her favorite color rven."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in excellent condition, not a scratch. Also after shopping around I got it for the absolute est price!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","okay i got this phone and it came in my buildings amazon hub,, my the battery 10/10 LONG LASTING, the condition of the phone is really good no cracks, it comes with a screen protector, everything about this phone is amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in great condition but upon setting it up, I encountered some errors first the Face ID was working but when tilting my face wasn’t detecting anything, ear speaker wasn’t working and phone battery health was 89% and when playing Call of duty mobile the device will lag while my Ac unit is chilling cold."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Except for the unboxing experience (Plain white box) the phone is BRAND NEW. I couldn't believe it. No scratches or scuffs a screen protector and charger 100 % battery. It in Product Red. I'm VERY satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its my second time I bought a iPhone from amazon renewed and with buyspry partner.

My first time was a iPhone xs, and the cellphone was great, no one visible scratch and screen protector and battery life about 85%

This time I was bought a iPhone 11, and this have 3 visible scratches in the screen and doesnt come with screen protector, but the battery is in 100%.

I am little dissaponited because in the last buy, the cellphone was practically in new condition, this last one I get the impression that is not new and its used unlike the last buy (I know that no one of amazon renewed its new, but it gives the feeling of)."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It look good as new apart from the fact the when your on a call it will just shut down and you have to wait about five to ten minutes before you can used it further more you can’t used it while on a call"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was so worried about buying a phone from here (iPhone 11) . It’s for my sons birthday and I haven’t given it to him yet so I’m not sure how it’s operating but it looks nearly brand new and it’s charging to 100%. I’ll update if there’s any problems but I have a feeling all will be fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had been looking everywhere for an unlocked iPhone 11 but they were hard to find. The refurbished price was about $800, unless I wanted to risk eBay. This was such a great deal and the phone works perfectly. It came in 4 days, was packaged carefully, and no problems at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the iPhone box arrived in very bad condition, that worries me that the phone is defective, so far it works well we will see in the future"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone for my teenage son and he absolutely love everything about it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I dislike for 79% battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A birthday gift for 16 year old son and an upgrade from his iPhone SE. However, upon using the phone's speakers, you can clearly not hear a peep out of the lower, left speaker. The phone failed the sound check, and got through Amazon's Quality Checks. Not good. Sent phone back for the $500+ refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is a piece of crap! The phone itself turns on and acts like it works just fine but then all of the typing letters it’s all mixed up and numbers can’t text at all! Biggest piece of crap I’ve ever bought. Worst part is I bought this for somebody that lives a state away and I can’t take it back because I can’t get it back from them so now they have to deal with this problem I’ll never buy from this vendor again you’re just a scam artist! What makes me more mad is I bought this for my 10-year-old daughter to communicate me your college and I can’t get it back from her because she can’t afford to send it and doesn’t have a way to get to a post office so now I’ve got an activated phone on a piece of crap you sold me thanks a lot for nothing Carmas a bitch"
"Apple","iPhone 11","First off I’m super surprised it came brand spanking new like no defects no chips no scratches and 100% battery no nasty flies or anything just pure bliss.lastly I skeptical just like you looking at this but I’ll tell right now it’s worth it I’m not sponsored either so you know it true"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone didn't work, sent it back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but you’re unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but don’t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that’s not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldn’t have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the phone for my daughter so far so good. Personally I wouldn't buy anything Apple but she loved it that's why she got it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery is 76% percent and it doesn’t last all day literally less then guarantee and won’t send me a replacement to transfer so I have a buy a second phone to transfer but now I have to trust that is gonna be over 80%. This is ridiculous but overall the phone does work just bad service with trying to get one that’s actually what day it was supposed to be"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived faster than expected. Not a scratch on it and Battery life was like new. Great Phone for my Wife and a great price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Vida útil de la batería era de 91%.
Pantalla con leves rayas y un desgaste en una esquina inferior trasera."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone 11 came in like brand new condition. No scratches or dings. The camera and size of the screen are much better than my old iPhone 7. Amazon made the purchase easy and stress free"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Soon as it was setup after taking a very long time to download and transfer it had a display error. Indicated it was either non genuine parts or installed incorrectly. Had to call for support then had to go to an Apple Store. Super inconvenient!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a bit scared getting this at first but when it arrived, it was in very good condition and I was able to add the phone to my plan on the same day!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was fine, but the charger did not charge the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a ""refurbished"" iPhone 11. The packaging was fine, professionally packed with all the included items as described. It had 81% battery life, also as described. However, as I was setting this phone up for my wife, I discovered the screen had been replaced with an ""unauthorized"" screen. As I was prepared to explain to my wife that the the ""big red balloon"" with the number 1 in setting was just fine, the phone locked up and would not restart, including a full reboot of the system. Returned to the seller the same day. Let's see if I get a refund properly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone it was so easy to set up the battery life is at 87% and it charges so much faster than my old phone (iphone8+) everything works and looks brand new. Also came with glass screen protector already on and clean!!! So satisfied, if you need a new phone i definitely recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with a few scratches on the screen but you can't see them after putting a screen protector on. Everything else works fine, the battery came in with 86% battery health."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me agrado lo que compré. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tenía más expectativas, xq al momento de realizar la compra indicaba q estaba en muy buenas condiciones, es decir me decidí xq el q me costaba un poco más a otra opción q había visto mas económica pero basándome en lo q leí q decía q estaba en Perfecto yo estado, resulta q al RECIBIRLO EL CELULAR TIENE UN GOLPE Q ES MUY EVIDENTE, ESTÁ PICADO DE UN LADO …la verdad no llenó mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Value for money
-I love this phone with all my heart even though I just got it like 4 days ago it’s amazing I haven’t had trouble with it AT ALL,it was fully unlocked so the only thing I had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this phone .There is a minor problem on the front camera when taking pics and vids there’s like a faded red light while take pics ,but nobody really can see it tbh"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I only have one complaint and its the speakers. They are incredibly quiet and crack a lot, will update when I return and get a new one with how it performs."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is loaded with features. It is quick and very elegant"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and the phone is unlocked. We were able to get it setup and on our current carrier. Please as punch."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it but the battery life could be better!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone. Easy to use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Haven't set up the phone yet but already disappointed. There is a deep gouge in the glass that is noticeable anytime there is a reflection on the screen, even from an arm's length away. I will wait to see how bad it is during the operation of the phone to decide whether to pursue a return, but I'm already worried about the integrity of the screen if it gets bumped."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have never used this product before but I’m trouble with my iPhone 8 and am ready for an upgrade. The camera looks really nice, it’s in new condition and it is set to the original settings on the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews. It came with a very small scratch on the screen that was hard to see unless you really looked. That has been the only thing that was “wrong” with the phone. Other than that, the phone has worked amazing, great battery life, awesome camera, and no hiccups on how it works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn’t come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone don’t let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I’m paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone itself looks like it was dropped a few times. Scratch is all over it scratched on the back. It's not refurbished like it comes from a recognized company. It's refurbished like it came from a friend that had it for a few years and decided to give it away because of how scratched up it has come. It is not working now and I'm about to send it back. The thing stopped turning on completely after putting a $80 case on it. Never dropping it. It practically never leaves my computer desk and still is having problems working. I don't understand this"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone and the first one I received did not work properly, the volume button did not work and not to mention the phone was filthy. There was gunk built up on the speaker. So I returned that one for a replacement. It was also damaged. The speaker didnt properly work. Nobody could hear me when I would FaceTime or talk on speaker. So I returned that phone as well and requested a refund I didn’t want another replacement. This was in April and Amazon still hasn’t refunded me the money for both phones, even after providing the tracking number and the person who signed for the phone confirming that it was returned. I’ve been going back and forth for 2-3 months now and nothing has been resolved. Which has left me with leaving a 1 star review. I’ve never given a bad review but this was deserving of it. Needless to say I will never buy a phone on Amazon again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome phone like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","You Might be skeptical of getting a renewed phone, but so far mine has had no noticeable issues or differences from a brand new one. Even physically, it was flawless; no scratches on the screen or dents or anythin. As far as I’m concerned, I basically got a new IPhone for 100 dollars off so I’m pretty happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had the phone for about a week and started noticing some issues with the Wi-Fi but would just reset my phone. One day the phone wouldn't let any calls or texts go through I ended up having to go to my phone carrier and see if they could help me and they got it working for a good 5-10min and the it went right back to not doing anything staying that there was no signal. I couldn't get onto any of my apps because there was no connection but when I went into the network settings, it said it was connected to the Wi-Fi. I'm very unclear about the issue but now I have to deal with sending it back to amazon and waiting to purchase the same kind through my phone carrier. I had bought an iPhone 7 off of Amazon and it works great still!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great ph for the right price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The I phone works great & our granddaughter loves it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love everything about this product and I’m not just saying that like I’m an apple fanboy it’s a really good phone great features and so on siri annoys me cause she chimes in for no reason but that’s always a thing over all it was well worth it ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can’t see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it’s gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it’s good I guess it doesn’t have YouTube but I’m satisfied I guess but, the price should’ve been lower than this since it’s refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo de acuerdo a lo detallado en la publicación"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I didn't like that the phone arrived in unusable condition. Tried for several hours to follow instructions but had to give up. Phone does not start up, only displays an intermittent flashing apple logo when plugged in to a charger, and responds ""cannot restore your iphone due to an unknown error"" when attempting to restore the software with my mac. This could only have slipped past the inspection if the tech was asleep..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came looking like it just left the apple factory, 100% battery life everything works perfectly excellent purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular vino impecable, con mica, nuevo, sin rayones, batería 100%. Lo compré en EEUU y lo traje a Ecuador, funciona de maravilla. Es la mejor compra que he hecho en años en amazon, pero ojo!!! Comprenlo con BuySPRY, de este proveedor ya había leído reseñas excelentes y no me falló, qué excelente servicio."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really love this phone! I was really nervous about it at first, but it came in really fast so not too much time to worry! When it arrived it was in perfect condition except for a lil bit of scuff marks in the top corner ( apply a lil dab of toothpaste and they become less noticeable! ) so I’m very, very happy with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery is BAD and max capacity is only 78 percent. Does not meet resale standards but was still passed off. Cover yourself and check the battery status.. also make sure you get your charger with your phone too… They like to skip out on that too"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Se calienta mucho y le dura muy poco la batería se traba también"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love my phone good As new 🥰🥰"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Listen hardware wise it’s okay. Some missing chips in paint and a lot of little scratches from an angle hopefully it doesn’t cause too much trouble when the screen protector comes in(will update later). Software I don’t see any problems so far but will edit if there comes an issue!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life sucks but other than that it’s a alright phone the 6 is better"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have only had this phone a few days and I really cannot give it a fair judgment will do later . The phone was delivered early and in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works perfectly! There was a slight cosmetic scratch on the front of my phone but that’s what you get for buying preowned. Had no issues with the phone though and it arrived earlier than expected. Satisfied with my purchase. Upgraded from an iPhone 6 and the battery life is just amazing on the 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was given as a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter she hasn’t fully set it up yet so it’s difficulty to rate at this time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buenisima compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone I purchased worked very well! The shop was also very accommodating and helpful. If it wasn’t for me going back to Android, I would’ve kept the phone.

I unfortunately was trying iPhone after being with android for 4 years, and I couldn’t do it. It was nice to be able to test the phone with the return guarantee. Also, not sure how they’re replacing batteries, but the battery life was so healthy on the phone. Great work!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was great for the first few months than it randomly started glitching."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased the refurbished phone in August for nearly $500. On Friday, after less than 6 mos. it stopped working. The screen would not swipe. I had used it just minutes ago and it was sitting in my purse and then it no longer functioned. I tried all the recommended Apple ""fixes"", to no avail. I took it to the Apple store.
Sadly, the phone is not able to be repaired unless hundreds of dollars are spent. It is NOT a software issue, it is the hardware. Something has failed and the phone is useless. Vendor was unable/unwilling to help."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So my major concern was having to worry about battery life cuz that’s always the issue with refurnished phones. This baby feels brand new. My only complaint would be that it took pretty long to finally get to me. It was scheduled to arrive in a week and I had to wait an extra 10 days to get it. The shipment hassle aside, it’s been well worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it. Best phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this to replace one my daughter had at college. The price was excellent and the features are good. It was easy to go to Verizon and have it set up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have to say, I was super scared to buy this phone off Amazon due to some suspicious reviews but I'm so glad I did! Not only is the item just as described, it has 100% battery capacity. It feels just like new, with no damages to be seen. Fully unlocked and everything works great! Couldn't be more excited :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Oh well.
The phone works great. no problems. would have preferred to get brand new.... Pd $700... if I'd only known then What I know now... July 9 - Sept. 9..... 2 months and I could've gotten brand new from my cellular provider for $590"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We ordered this phone for one of the company employees and he is very happy with the phone. The phone did not looked used or refurbished at all. The quality is like a new phone. Everything works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all I’m missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a bit worried buying a phone on amazon at this cost, but when the phone came I was not disappointed. The phone came in perfect condition.. It seemed like I just brought the phone from apple. It already had a screen protector on it, and along with the phone there was a charger. Transferring my sim card was easy; in the box there’s a sim card remover which made the process even more simple. I recommend buying from this seller, and I will be looking forward buying from this seller in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Solo tenia pequeños rasguños en la parte superior e inferior, de ahí todo funciona bien, batería al 93%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","In good condition. No scratches, came with a screen protector.

The only problem is that it has turned off a couple of times when I least expect it after having it less than a month, it turns right back on, but it is a major inconvenience. I had to find a repair shop near me to fix it. Since I use my phone for work, I cannot be without one. I contacted the seller and was only refunded $20 (I kept the phone for my work)

I recommend that if you do get a used phone, to double-check everything before getting rid of your old one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have to be up front and say I wasn’t sure about this at first. It was a lot of money to pay. Considering it’s my first iPhone coming from android. I got the iPhone 11 fully unlocked in black and it was super easy to get activated. A fast charger came with it no headphones but I use truly wireless earbuds so I’m good. My final verdict is buy the phone it will be a great investment. My experience has been so great my woman wanted one so we’re currently waiting for it to come in the mail."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy bonito todo se ve bien pero no fue compatible ya lo envía hace las de 10 días de regreso y no recibo mi reembolso"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This one had the best reviews so I ordered it. Looks like a brand new, never used iphone! Everything works and my brother was very happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Gifted it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone had a 90 day warranty. On day 87, the phone started to act up. Power button wouldn't work, etc. On the morning of the 91st day, the phone died. I called Amazon who contacted the seller for me to ask for a one time exception to grant the return. The seller, BuySPRY, said ""no"" and suggested that I take it to a local repair shop. I contacted Amazon again and they granted the return.

There were warning signs:

1) The phone came with a few greasy finger prints.
2) The battery would only charge to 80% (which is what they claimed, so OK)
3) Out of the box, the phone had a hard time setting up. Took a few tries.

Anyway, maybe BuySPRY is a good company, but without Amazon customer service, I would have been out $500."
"Apple","iPhone 11","camara has a vibrating motion pictures, and videos are blurry"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not only is the color so pretty on the phone the face recognition is so fast and the battery life is amazing. Definitely worth the spend, not a scratch or ding on this phone. And it came a day early!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this Iphone 11 back in November of 2021. I’m very careful with this phone and it has always been in a LifeProof case the entire time. I informed BuySPRY about this issue and they only told me there is nothing they can do about it since it’s out of warranty.

I find that quite odd seeing that BuySPRY is an e-commerce business that fixes electronics and resells them ? This is equivalent to buying a used car from a used car salesperson that is also a mechanic, but refuses to fix the car that they just sold you.

I find this business to be quite sketchy and would stay away personally."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m asked to give a review and I haven’t received my order yet. It’s been delayed twice. It’s wrong to advertise delivery on a specific day and then wait until the day of to inform me of the delay. So far my experience has been not good. (Updated Review) Finally received my “ Premium Certified “ phone and it’s very clear from the damaged corners it has taken some hits. This was going to be a Birthday present but the delays made sure it didn’t arrive in time for that."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone to small"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works well so far good for the money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I honestly thought this may have been a scam but it wasn’t and the package even came early. Everything works great and the battery life is 94%. The only minor thing is when I got the phone, it was on 2%. But I charged it and it was fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It like that everything was nice on the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.

Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There’s also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.

I’m incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Producto en excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Eh. In my opinion, it’s just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, it’s got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. I’m still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I can’t believe I waited so long to purchase it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought what I thought would be a ""like new"" phone for well over $400, and it has spots all over the screen as if the LED lights have been damaged. I went to return it, and it says the phone is not eligible for refunds."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Loved the product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Las llamadas no salen ni entran y cuando escribía en la pantalla había que hacerle mucha presión o con mucha fuerza con el dedo para poder escribir."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone its self was in good condition.. but battery dies to quickly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is exactly as described. Works great. No issues at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Generally, it is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks brand new but when I went to activate it at AT&T the phone could not be activated."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far it’s good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes I’ll update my review."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this for my husband’s birthday in August. He loves it, the phone works just as good as mine that I paid double the price for. It was a good buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Minor chip in one corner but everything works great. My brother loved his new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","For 2021 the battery has been great, ios is always good and camera is more than good for the average user and very good at night. However if you’re on a budget get an xr for a lot less and basically the same phone with a little bit worse camera. Still awesome buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Constantly got a prompt about the screen being replaced with a product not authorized by apple. Reported it and nothing came out of the situation."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone arrived and was in perfect looking condition. I was able to swap SIM cards and activate on my Metro PCS account within minutes. All was going great until the 90 day period came and I was unable to hear anyone when holding the phone to my ear. I went into an Apple store to diagnose and they told me it would cost $280 to replace the speaker, they showed me where a screw had pierced the speaker, probably during refurbishing. So only able to talk on speaker or Bluetooth now. Following this, my battery began going down so quickly, the most I could use the phone navigation was 10 minutes until it would turn off. I checked my battery settings to find out that my maximum capacity is 23%.
This is such a scam, fraud and misrepresentation of an iPhone. Don’t waste your hard earned money and get screwed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol)."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in excellent condition. Battery was nearly completed charged and there weren’t any scratches on the screen. The phone was ready to be set up and was fully unlocked so I could use my old SIM. It also came with a screen protector on it which was a nice touch."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product was nice, it had some problem but I was refunded"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is what I expected, however the battery life is dwindling."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Internet, email and searching"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter worked all summer to purchase a phone, and this phone lasted 10 days past the 90 day warranty. Despite only having the phone for three months, the seller refused to provide a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone easy set up"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buena compra 🤩"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The best phone for the BEST price, BuySpry really did it again. Second time buying from them and honestly they did not disappoint. Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i love it only thing was wrong was my screen i couldnt use letters left if screen paid to get screen replace but anything ither than that was fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in perfect conditions, and arrived earlier yeah expected. Came with screen protector and charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like that I can play Brawlhalla"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am honestly ashamed that this was allowed to come through to my house, it says that some products may have components that weren't made by apple, I understand that, but it said that it would work the same. The one I got from Avant Solutions didn't, it was a unauthentic screen from who knows where that only worked half the time, it came with the bottom right of the screen blacked out, the face I.D. would only work a 4th of the time. On top of all that sometimes when I turned on the screen it would just be black led lights showing up, I would have to reset the phone for the screen to turn back on again. I am very mad, I have already sent the package back but it is very weird for me because this is the first time I have actually been scammed by a seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don't like it, I brought the screen a little off"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m loving everything about this phone! It’s definitely worth the hype, and the money. I love all of the features, and I can’t think of a weak link so far. I was skeptical before purchasing it, but I’m glad that I did. One of the things that I like about it is the face recognition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery said 80% minimum and I got less paid for excellent condition and got acceptable. A bunch of scratches visible. While I was setting it up the phone had already gotten extremely hot after only doing the set up for the iPhone which didn’t even take long."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone doesn’t work when answering calls"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had many iPhones. This is the best so far. I find it funny that there were So many complaints about not having a home button when the touch screen is the home button. It works even better than the home button. And as far as the face recognition is concerned, I can have a hat on and it will still recognize only my face. I was however worried that someone could access it while I was sleeping but I’ve found that it won’t if your eyes are closed. The swipe texting is even a bigger plus."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.

If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I dislike no availability of hotspot"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered this phone on a Saturday, received it the following Saturday. Battery life at 100% and it was almost fully charged. One tiny scuff on the top edge but only noticeable because I was looking for them. No cracks. Honestly was sooo nervous about ordering it but after a couple days, I just did it. I’m so relieved it was worth it! I’m writing this review from it! I’m sorry for the others it didn’t work out for but it gets my 100% approval."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Don’t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word. Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.

I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product arrived on time. It’s exactly as advertised. Considering getting another one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Couldn’t find a phone anywhere during the pandemic as my old ones battery was dying out. I was a little Leary on purchasing this kind of product from Amazon but it arrived quickly, no damage and set up and operated very easily. I would not be afraid to buy an apple product that has been refurbished ever again from amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! ♥"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is a replacement for a iPhone 6splus."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There are some cracks in the display. I applied the return but, the postage required which is not free (we need to pay the postage by ourselves). Why do we have to pay the postage return fee? Please give another instruction to return with free."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pro’s about the purchase: Phone arrived a day earlier than expected and was in excellent condition and even had a screen protector on the screen so that was a plus

Cons about the purchase: The phone had a bad SIM card reader in it and would not read my SIM card even after taking to AT&T for a new Sim so I had to take it to a repair shop and pay an additional $80 for a repair in order for my SIM card to work"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only the thing I didn’t like is the charger it came with I’m going to be honest that charger I could have gone without it it takes so long to charge the phone but otherwise everything was smooth"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is a refurbished phone. Minor scratches on the back and sides of the phone. However, with a phone case you don’t see any of the cosmetic damage. Phone works like a champ and holds a charge."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was a good buy. Look like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great but I’m disappointed by the scratches the backside has some scratches but the scratch in the frontside at the bottom left is noticeable I wish they would show a picture of the phone to sell and not get surprised when it comes in"
"Apple","iPhone 11","There’s an Apple warning label about a defective part inside the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It has more updated things and easy to use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone appears to work well, but I was quite disappointed by the appearance. The screen and phone case are very scratched up. If I didn't need a phone immediately I would have sent it back. REally expected a nicer looking phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was not impressed, the screen is a turn off with all the scratches. One of the speakers is very low, I can barely hear my calls. The battery life is 81%, the phone dies quickly. It’s really a hit or miss tbh so take precautions when purchasing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My children very glad this phone )"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've had the phone for about 16 hours. Nothing but trouble right from the start. It keeps restarting itself and shutting the screen off randomly. I spent over an hour troubleshooting with Apple. They said that it's probably bad software. I'm sure iPhone 11s are great, just don't waste your money buying it from Amazon. Buy refurbished directly from Apple. That way you have options if it doesn't work (other than wasting your time returning it.)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have only had the phone for about 24 hours, but I am so happy with it! Not a scratch, nic, or dent. Looks brand new. It even came with a screen protector all ready on it. Charges fast. Came with brand new charging wire and plug. Did not come in an iPhone box, but did come packaged securely in a similar box. At this point I am beyond thrilled... hope my opinion stays the same in the coming days!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a great value for us. On our iPhone 7 it used the fingerprint the iPhone 11 uses face Recognition I love it!! Also no home button. You just swipe so much easier!! I actually bought two of them one red and one black fir my husband. They both look and act like new phones. Only way to go!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great just like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is almost brand new! Battery health up to 91%, only a few ( around 4 tiny specks) scratches, unlocked (im in latinamerica), with working faceID, speakers etc. AMAZING purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived sooner than expected. Cosmetic looks new. Adding to existing account went well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Para mi huso personal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Needed to upgrade my phone and this is the ticket--I'm still learning and so far I have no complaints!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone practically brand new took forever to come though but hey 100% battery health. Four stars because you spend $600 you expect your package to be here took 14 days though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have ordered phones twice from this seller and they consecutively send phones with low battery health. one device was 75% and the other 77%. I find this to be very dishonest because i even messaged the seller privately before the order was shipped to confirm that the battery Healths would be 80 or above and sameeeeeee result. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND! returning both phones!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fast shipping works just like new no scratches or anything in particular so far so good,I recently bought (2) from different sellers and I had to send it back within days.,fingers cross I would recommend it to anyone who has problems like me in the past with others sellers this renewed are basically new ones 👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La pantalla tenía demasiados rayones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","That’s it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ok so I know there’s a lot of people saying this order is not worth but honestly I got my phone a VERY good condition and would buy again in the future I WOULD totally recommend you buy this if is so worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have yet to be disappointed with this phone!!! Yes... took me a minute to get used to the phone/screen size comparing an iPhone 7 but hands down... Good job Apple and good job Amazon for a clean... refurbished product that works so flush 👌🏼The data transfer via Cloud was super fast and easy. Probably the best I’ve dealt with yet.Screen resolution... keyboard tranquility... overall battery & performance?? Forget about it... because this device has it all !!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone came in working fine, it did not support wireless charging like it is supposed to but we did not mind and kept it anyway. After a year of use, the screen popped out and is now sticking out of the iPhone like the adhesive is no longer working. The phone now also turns off randomly even on a full battery, WOULD NOT recommend buying from this seller as their customer service is nonexistent, I have not heard back in 2 weeks."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No volvería a comprar de este proveedor y lean bien antes de adquirir un producto del mismo, la batería en malas condiciones y el teléfono con muchos golpes a pesar de indicar que son de excelentes condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came In like brand new couldn’t tell a difference. Definitely would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It has some issue with volume and when I put the speaker mode in a call the sound quality is bad . It shows signs that it was opened and screwed back in at the bottom of the phone where the speakers are. I ended up buying headphones to be able to use it. I put volume on maximum to have a disent sound. I understand that it is a renewed model but for the price i paid i was expecting a much better quality . Battery life is very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone, could not tell it was refurbished, came with a screen protector on it. The only bummer is that it did not come with ear pods but I noticed Apple is no longer giving those out either, so it's all good! It turned out to $40 cheaper than a new phone, and with some Amazon credits I had I would up getting a $600 phone for about $420, go refurb!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great and at a great price will definitively buy another one in a couple years"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received phone. Took 2 hours to set up. Then when I tried to make a phone call, the microphone does not work. Tried to return. Was told this is a third party and they will take 48 hours to respond. I NEED THIS PHONE........ THIS REFURBED PRODUCT SUCKS... DONT BUY....."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The charging port seems to be faulty. I bought it in excellent condition just so it didn't have such problems. There are minor scratches, but I don't care about those."
"Apple","iPhone 11","great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in great condition, it did arrive a day earlier than expected. It also came with a screen protector & phone case. I got the phone for my son & he's constantly on it so maybe that's why his battery doesn't last as long, lol..but other than that, we were very pleased with our purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got 2 iPhones within a couple of weeks. First one lasted for about 3 weeks. Second didn’t even pass the “check you country”. It freezes every time I restarted it. I called Amazon. All they told me is I have to wait for the seller to call me in 48 hours. Waste of money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This iphone is not unlocked as stated. I put my sin card and it doesn’t work and tried other sim cards and it didn’t either. Is comes up that it only works with virgin mobile."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Almost like new! It had a couple light scratches in the back and a bit deeper one on the bottom side (not the screen but on the gold/black part) it isn’t anything to be upset about since it’ll be covered by a case and isn’t that visible unless you look for it.The phone heats up a little bit sometimes but I’ve noticed it’s when I’m holding my phone more by the middle. Works great! Make sure to update the software or the apps won’t load"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My new iPhone arrived on time, in great shape, and unlocked. I would recommend to anyone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my renewed iphone 11looked ok but it turned out to no good couldn’t hear any thing through ear speaker had to use headphones to use it called Amazon about it told me I have to contact the 3rd party seller save your money and time! Buy A New One its probably going to cost of a new one after buying a replacement for the one you just got a think Amazon should be responsible for the new one and I’ll return this this one when I got the replacement one so read the return policy Amazon is getting more like EBay selling other people’s junk I hope this helps anyone,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Just bought this a few days ago. I really wanted to take car of it so I bought a waterproof case even before I got the phone. So here’s the thing the phone works like new but with just 1 big flaw. Every time someone calls me and I answer the call, the screen just shuts off and I wouldn’t be able to do anything to it for a couple of minutes.it can last for at least 30 minutes. So the trick is I have to be the one to make the call that’s the way to stop it. I guess I can tolerate this but hopefully no more issues comes up."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in a good shape looks like having a new screen . It seems like the speakers not working and I can’t hear anybody calling me. Worse thing I am stuck with this phone out side states for a while . So disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I can not coment on the actual performance, except to say that If you are an Apple user this is a good choice. My friend did not like the xr. This one has huge storage capacity, retina display, and there are plenty of accessory items available."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it, phone work on good condition!! EVERYTHING work totally fine, and it actually came WAYYYY faster then it was supposed to"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent condition physically and operationally and even had glass screen protectors still installed and without a blemish"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy mala.calida la batería esta en un porcentaje bajo y el sonido es muy mal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with a defective battery that wouldn’t charge . They obviously didn’t check the phone before they sent it . I got it as a gift so instead of returning it I paid an additional 100 dollars to get it fixed so they could have it on time. Horrible first experience"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone appeared to operate just fine other than the fact that the speakers were either blown or there was a bad soundboard, because all of the audio coming out of the speakers was distorted and sounded terrible, phone calls on speaker up to the ear, tried watching something on YouTube that was distorted as well. I am not happy at all. I didn’t realize the phone had this issue until after I had put in all of my information and began downloading a software update and then everything from iCloud… wasted hours of my life I’ll never get back because they sent me a phone that doesn’t play sound properly. Sucks. I am ordering another one and I will update my review.

Update: I decided to go with the iPhone 11 Pro in badass army green, because it was only $400 (however, the seller immediately upped price $40 after my purchase). I will post my review on that specific page as it doesn’t make sense to post here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received it before the predicted arrival time and everything works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This came like it was brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is okay 👍🏼"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Super skeptical after the 1 star reviews, but hey 90 Amazon money back I figure what the heck. Great product basically new batter capacity is 100% no problems with the phone. I got a t mobile specific phone swapped the sim and off I went. Nice product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is fully functional as stated. Phone is as described . Got quick delivery as well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","BIRTHDAY PRESENT GONE WRONG. Bought this for my mother in law for her birthday. Tried to get all her stuff transferred onto it. She even took it to T-Mobile they worked on it for two hours. They kept telling me it was unlocked and it should work. I finally called APPLE and she was helping me then asked me what my iCloud were that was logging into. Surprise! Someone else’s iCloud was still logged into the phone. Sent it back with the return label they gave me and now they are saying they didn’t not get it. IM OUT ALL THAT MONEY. 10 out of 10 do not recommend. Amazon was no help either!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like new iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Disgusting condition!
Cigarette smell and full of scratches, the battery life is 81%, 10% charge lasted 3 minutes.
Considering bought as Excellent condition, in reality is worse than poor!
WIll return and won't deal with the store anymore((("
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought for wife’s birthday. So far, it works fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very Happy Overall"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone didn’t have any damages whatsoever not even a scratch!! Connected perfectly with my AT&T service. Only thing i would say is that it came with 83% battery health WHICH still last me literally all day! Would buy again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product came in earlier than expected. These iPhones are good as new and I recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an iPhone. I bought 1 for myself and another for my girlfriend and they were both beautiful and in perfect condition. I was also pleased to see that both came with a screen protector installed. I am very satisfied with this product and I suggest this product to anybody looking to get a basically brand new iPhone for a better price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone so far everything about it is perfect besides the fact that it restarts all the time whenever it feels like it .. oh and I don’t think my camera flash works lol but not positive on that because my flash works on the Snapchat app"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm very upset at myself for not listening to the other reviewers that said to not buy a refurbished phone from this buyer. I got a OLD OLD iphone 11 black, first of all the black has tiny white dots from thr dirt accumulating in the old case, around the lends is so scratched up, the battery life is so BAD, after fully charging it only last for about 4 hours so dissapointed. let me not start on the charger, its one of the most chinese no good charger you may ever see, i wsih i could post pictures or return it but i live of a tiny island in honduras and it took 3 weeks to get here so by the time i send it back it wont be there on time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Happy with the phone so far only complaint is it arrived with scratches on screen face, since my screen protector kinda hides it , Is only reason i did not send it back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Would no longer connect to Cell phone Carrier after 6 months. And was told the warranty was no longer valid. STEAR CLEAR OF ""AMAZON RENWED"" we paid way to much for it to not even last a year!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but I’m so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived looking brand new. However the back camera is not working. I restarted the phone and it worked for short while, and then stopped working again. I recommend buying a brand new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Non"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The charger that mine came with caught on fire, and burned a hole in my seat, the phone screen wasn’t apple and peeled off, and I tried getting a replacement but the buyer still isn’t getting back to me even after I already returned it. And I haven’t gotten a refund"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular está en buen estado, pero la vida de la batería no muy buena, estaba a un 93% cuando lo compramos y 1 mes después a 85%. Llego con un cargador de muy mala calidad, lo pusimos a cargar con este y luego de unos minutos el celular se empezó a recalentar, lo dejamos de usar inmediatamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly, if you buy it through amazon, it already comes unlocked, ready to use, and nothing changes about the phone's performance and its cheaper than buying it in the actual apple store (if paying for full price all at once)."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived with a deep ding/crack right in the middle of the screen. It was impossible not to see this. Returning immediately, without turning on.

This is discussing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sadly, the battery life is 84% and the phone itself is scratched and visually worn. So it’s going back. Unfortunately this is the second phone I ordered from this seller. The first one had a battery life of 86%. I sent that one back and ordered this one hoping for a better phone. Truly disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Private use. It’s easy to use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","after four months, the phone started resetting on its own and flashing doing all type of crazy stuff, meaning one of the parts was old and not looked at. honestly if you can buy the 11 brand new, do so and buy it WITH APPLE!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thanks so much!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","UPDATE: return and refund went smoothly. New phone works perfectly, no issues!

According to Apple this is a faulty device that needs to be replaced. It randomly powers down and they say it's a logic board problem that cannot be fixed. I'm hoping the seller will contact me ASAP to exchange the phone for a product that is not damaged. If so I will update my review to reflect that. This was my Mothers' Day gift. Kind of sucks that it's broken."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was realllllyyyy scared to purchase a phone off of Amazon at first. I had it in my cart for days but I’m glad I decided to go ahead and purchase this. I’ve been having the phone for over 6 months and have had 0 problems. I was able to activate it with my phone provider with no issues as well. No regrets at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It messes up all the time glitches and apps disappear and it cuts on and off repeatedly . Definitely not worth the money I regret my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this as a gift as it said it was unlocked . My sister couldn’t connect it and took it to an Apple Store and they said they couldn’t help because it was locked. And I returned it and didn’t get my money back."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The quality and product overall.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","excellent condition but phone does not work apple stated the software needs to be updated and their is a problem with the phone wii return but phones other function are great -problem is i spent 5 hours trying to fix it with apple and sprint seller should have know so i can not in good faith recommend them or buy from them"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone and was instantly disappointed. From the first call attempt I noticed the microphone did not work and speaker sounded distorted. extremely disappointed with this purchase. Specially because of the false information claiming this cell was tested and inspected to ensure quality and functionality. I obviously sent it back and am currently awaiting a refund that by the way is going on 3 weeks since this was shipped and ordered from a third party."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono llego antes de lo esperado. Funciona bien todo, lo único que no me gusto es que la pantalla tiene dos rapaduras scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen has a few scratches as stated in listing. Battery life is 96%. For the money, it could have been sent with a Apple charger and some ear buds. But so far it works like it should. I’d buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen scratched up more than I would have liked!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came with a phone charger which was nice, phone worked just as promised and came fully carrier unlocked. Would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone I received has pretty significant scratches and paint loss, even when held at an arm's length. It did not include a sim removal tool and I have a message about a non-Genuine Apple display... which means this phone was repaired with third party parts. not sure if the message will ever go away. Just buy it outright new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Seller did not sell item in good condition. The volume does not work well. Definitely not worth it. Please be aware of this seller! Definitely not truthful about selling product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So Apple is a weirdo and has to have Apple certified screens and the screen that they used weren’t Apple certified which caused a lot of issues I had to take the phone in to an Apple store and pay the same amount to fix the screen that I payed to buy the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11",":))"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in great shape, it has a screen protector on it, and it came preloaded with an app that allows you to test all the buttons. I have had no issues so far! I have had it for about 1.5 months."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I upgraded from an iphone 8, and I am so glad that I did! Battery life is long, screen had no scratches, minimal wear on the back side, and was fully unlocked for me to add my own sim card."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone was not having a great battery life as expected or reviewed others, maybe renewed compromise. Display was not that great, had some wear and tear. But features of Iphone 11 are all functional. Had to return but its almost more than 2 weeks, I have not received the refund of it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone. OnlyProblem I did not get a earphone with it. I would not mind if the seller could send me a earphone that would give this a full 5 star ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly I am over all very happy with this purchase! Mine was in perfect external condition! The battery life is a tiny bit shorter than my previous iPhone but nothing crazy!I’m honestly very satisfied and happy with this purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good stuff!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Never got a chance to use the phone as the setup would not go past the language and country set up. This one was a dud."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased this as a gift for my younger sibling. Works great but does come in an unorthodox box and the charger did not work well. Still an Apple product and worked fine with any carrier. I would definitely take it to a carrier to be activated."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it! Basically brand new I’ve seen plenty good reviews and thought I’d try it! If you buy it unlocked you get it unlocked for sure!! Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agrado el hecho de que no trajera el cargador y el cable adecuados para el modelo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My first day of using this phone, and with half a battery, the phone just dies. Then I get a notification saying it’s not an “Apple battery” so now my phone constantly has an error message and I never really know what the battery is at."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame) and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick. When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I personally didn’t have any issues when ordering this. It’s a great phone and I’m very happy with it. I have ordered phone from Amazon in the past and lucked out with them working properly. Ether Amazon is getting the better phones or I just got lucky with this one. I would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life is really good but not a fan of the charger that came with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery Life improvement"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Aveces tiene un pequeno descontrol con el volumen pero despues de ahi esta perfecto, me encanta, es mi herramienta mas importante de trabajo desde casa.La carga dura mucho, no es necesario cargarlo todos los dias, con cada 2 dias esta perfecto y le doy mucho uso."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So I was very skeptic , I never had bought a phone from amazon, but seriously loved it, I got the phone in a usps box with charger, but the phone is like new, so far it’s been 5 days and the phone is just working fine, so happy for the purchase looking forward on getting pro for my sister from them next month"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money I’ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My son loves it, everything works very well!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","And you get 79% it’s a bummer. I know it’s only 1% difference, but I spent a lot of money. I researched. My old phone was a 6s, I’ve had it for many years and the only thing wrong was the battery health was 82% and not holding a charge. I may return this if it does not hold a charge. I’ve only had it one day. I will post update if it I have to return."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The microphone doesn't work. The phone is not worth the price we paid for it. I am requesting that the seller refunds the amount to have the mic fixed. I think that is fair."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this phone few months back and it doesn’t have a genuine Apple battery really disappointed with purchase just save the extra money to buy new product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived fast and had no defect. It has a battery health of 85% and cameras are really nice."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I took this phone out the box, it looked brand new. It came in perfect condition as you can see in the pics. And to top it off, the battery health was at 95%. Really happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo llegó con la pantalla rayada y el Mic no funciona casi nada.. no me escuchan al llamar o se va y viene la captación de audio."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little bit iffy about buying it but I did and when it came in I wasn’t disappointed, I love it I have never had an iPhone before and I am very happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve bought the iPhone 11 waiting to get an excellent condition or like new as advertised. But it came in a poor condition with a lot of signs of use and a little dent on the screen. I’ve returned the item and refunded without problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone is ok, just the way it should work an iPhone 11 but, sadly, it has three really big scratches on the top of the screen. I thought about return it but I am from Venezuela and is a little bit expensive make that, so, now, I have a $600 phone with scratches on the screen... Well, at least work fine, it's unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Idk if it’s really worth it when I got mine the screen started glitching and I have like this light spot on the bottom and I also found out that the speaker was blown its sounds like someone farting when I play a song I would return but those things don’t bother me personally but it may be a deal breaker for someone else"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone was likes new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It had 50% battery when I went to sleep. I woke up four hours later and it was completely dead. Waste of money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","We got the phones early in excellent condition,we love everything about them so far no scratches nothing,phone's basically brand new.. two iphone 11 was purchased one for me n my sister ,would Definetly recommend any one to purchase from this seller..absolutely in love with our phones..No problems so far n the phone works well...TY so much."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego en perfecto estado, casi no tiene defectos estéticos luce como nuevo, la batería le dura bastante, la verdad muy satisfecha con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great So far Will buy another"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery dies early and Face ID barley worked. Within two weeks the phone over heated and screen popped out and it is not a real Apple display."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived on, but battery is in great condition. Phone looks like and functions like new. I have no complaints and am very happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy bueno, hasta ahora todo excelente. todo funciona de maravilla"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was shipped with battery health at 84%. Unfortunately it’s my first iPhone after life of Android so I didn’t catch that until after the 30 days warenry"
"Apple","iPhone 11","MY daughter was elated when she received this for Christmas! Worked perfectly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came with slight scratches on the face and the camera,battery health came at 88."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product arrived a day early. Nice. The phone was in excellent condition, no scratches on phone nor screen. Fully charged, I went to ATT and got a SIM card, took minutes and free. Since I lost my phone and did not backup, my fault, I had to download apps and do my own email stuff. The phone is nice with works well. Very happy, only had it one day, but we are off to a great start!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s like new and the battery lasts—only needs to be charged every couple of days."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was okay I apologize It’s been a while for it to come but it came"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I thought I was going to be lucky. Usually I ignore reviews, DONT IGNORE! This phone was not fully unlocked and it had stated it was even in the settings. It lied, spent too much money trying to get it fixed. Not worth it at all. I am very disappointed, hope to get my money back or any sort of compensation. Don't go through the tears and trials that I did. Very upset with this product wish it was better."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the color and the phone is almost like new. I ordered an XR before this and was not satisfied with its feature. Easy return and was able to purchase this one. Great quality. Great battery life. Great camera."
"Apple","iPhone 11","False advertising!Please lookup this seller and read all bad reviews before making a purchase.What a terrible experience (Lots of aggravation, wasted time, wasted money).Please buy it at your local store or somewhere else. It's not worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received item few scratches around sides that’s ok it’s a renewed phone but camera on back is cracked and pushed in and front screen scratched all up"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It looks really new and perfect my daughter loved it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was expected. Very happy with it. Face recognition works well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The IPhone came in and was one excellent condition! It had a screen protector installed already which was done perfectly! Extremely satisfied with these guys!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery health is only 84% and I don’t feel I got my moneys worth."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good Phone. Have always bought refurbished phones off Amazon and have never had a problem. Battery life was 88% but besides that great product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The only issue I had with this phone is the inability to download new apps"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this tested/renewed/guaranteed I phone, transfered all my data and sim card only to find that the phone does not work-the microphone is inoperable-Avant solution? Take it to Best Buy and they will split the repair cost, or purchase another phone from them, wait for it to arrive, transfer my data again and return the broken phone. Sounds kind of backwards to me. Right now, they have my money and i have a broken phone and it's all on me to make it right. Not what I expected from Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone in may. After a month or so I started having problems with the phone. Five months later the phone would not power on. I reached out to the seller and they basically said that the guarantee expired that they won’t replace nor give me a refund. If you are thinking of buying a phone from this seller please don’t!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is good but some how the screen giving problem to touch."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product has lot of scratches and does not meet the criteria for excellent condition. They added a tempered glass on top of the screen to hide scratches. Returning it back."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Literally food was on it had to clean every inch of it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is not unlock for different carrier. Loose time buying this product that they advertise something that is not work"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I always buy refurbished, but most importantly, I always buy refurbished from this company. I have been through two phones and both have worked AMAZING. Price is great and product is better."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just got new iPhone 11 , upgrading from a 7 and it is amazing so far. Phone came in great shape and beats financing phones. A lot of negative reviews so was skeptical about ordering but seems fine to me . Go with your guy at the end of the day"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bout this in may and by September the battery level is 58% the screen Face ID stop working and not the actual screen coming off the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusta que el teléfono esta en perfectas condiciones, funciona todo súper bien 100% de batería, como decía desbloqueado tenía miedo de eso pero soy de Paraguay y me funciona perfectamente con los operadores locales.. más que recomendada esta compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works fine but some times it go slow of the system, the phone looks ok no damage or anything, only thing you have to beware you might get a bad one I feel, you pay what you get !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery wasn’t replaced like I expected in a refurbished phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","HUGE scratches and marks all over. The description clearly says no visible defects from 12 inches away, but it looks like the phone was repeatedly dropped on pavement."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It had scratches on the screen so did not meet my exceptions"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works good I’ve had it for about a month and it works just like a new phone no problems out of it. Can’t even tell it’s refurbished has some small scratches on the back that aren’t noticeable but other than that it’s a good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic “iPhone” packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As if I went to the apple store and bought it straight from there, but cheaper for the storage. I’ve had this phone for about 5 months now and all that I’ve seen is it’s gets a bit hot if I use big apps, and it lags a bit if I have too many things opened. But it’s literally good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego en muy buenas condiciones, solo un detalle en la esquina un rasponcito y un ligero arañaso en la pantalla pero que ni se nota, ademas la bateria llego con el 96%. Recomiendo este vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recently had to bring my I phone 11 to Verizon and they couldn’t help me because the screen Amazon replaced on my phone isn’t genuine apple equipment. So my trade in value is now zero they won’t even take it. I wasn’t told the screen was even replaced and they use sub par parts. Buyer beware"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Best phone ever"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Absolute garbage. FRAUD!! STAY AWAY! The phone came broken and I have to wait almost a month for a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Didn’t like price alt all way too expensive"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esta prácticamente nuevo, y funciona muy bien. Solo que llego con mucho retraso"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Teléfono en muy buen estado, tal y como lo indican en la reseña. Todo igual según lo explicado, buena compra y me ahorré 100 dólares si compraba uno nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first when I powered it on it display not a original Apple product after dismissing the msg it working with out a hitch"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a very good value for our money. Love the quality of the pictures it takes and the battery last a long time. Couldn’t be happier if it was a new one !! We actually bought two of them one black and one in red. Both are great!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered an iPhone 11 for my niece's birthday took a week to come in when I received how did defective screen horrible customer service did not offer any kind of logical solution DO NOT BUY from this seller spend your money elsewhere."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not buy! The previous reviews go in depth with all this functions and mishaps I encounter with this phones exactly. I only had the phone a few hours before experience the iCloud issues and overall only kept the phone for 2 days. They did give my money back but everyone hasn’t been as lucky."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we’ll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don’t feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The Phone speaker was wasted. It's not worth the headache to send it back. Cost $75 bucks to have new speakers installed.""fully refurbished"" not exactly. But hey, You're throwing the dice on a used product.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funcionando de buena forma!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone it’s self is good but it is a lie bout it being carrier unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone froze and could not be set up. Seller approved return but won't answer my email about when I will receive my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is good and in great condition but it is not fully unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","They said a minimum of 80% of battery health and I got 99% out the box which I love since it lasts all day. This is a value for your money since buying it on apple website, it’s $749 (for 256GB) while on here it’s $614 (depending on the color for 256GB)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn’t updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I’ve had it for a week now)Update :Phone really isn’t unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It’s it works only with cdma networks 🤦🏽‍♀️ Not happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Man this is great! Got this a couple months ago for me and and my girlfriend and they work great! Only problem was the chip for a boost mobile phone but you just have to ask for a new one and they will give it to you! Everything works fine and I recommend this! 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I would suggest you stay away from getting any phone from them! The phone would not get any service for 3 weeks. We were constantly calling our cell phone service complaining to them that it wasn’t working. They sent out a new SIM card and we were still having problems. We go to Best Buy to get them to check the phone and they tell us the phone is not capable of getting service! They tell us the hardware is damaged on the phone! Do not waste your time or money!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It worked and all but there was a few small scratches on it and I returned it. I had no problems with the return and luckily didn't have to pay to return the phone. Its a beautiful looking phone. I give it 3 stars because it is such a good phone and the return was easy and fair. I just hope they can be more diligent making sure there are no scratches on a phone before they send it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good! I needed to upgrade my phone for awhile and postponed. This was such a. Great deal on a refurbished phone. A 36 month contract with a phone carrier to get a similar phone would have cost me double."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y’all. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it! I was upset because when received the box was open and the phone was sliding around. It was not damaged though. Other than that the phone it’s self is awesome! Came with a charger and films on both sides of the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The camera has a lot of cosmetic damage"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My boyfriend and I both got phones and they work perfectly. I’ve had it for 6/7 months now and through drops and everything it’s still a great phone. The size and color were exactly what we ordered it came in a nice box and earlier than the delivery time! Def recommended"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the fact its on excellent visual conditions with no scratches, like new. Excellent battery lifetime. Camera on perfect conditions. Face ID on. Excellent purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","New iPhone user and I’m still getting used to it but so far so good. There are a few things that I miss from my Android but I guess that’s expected. Phone was in great condition but it was missing a Headset."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good buy. I got my phone on timel. The phone is almost looks brand new also battery life is great, camera works amazing. I so happy with my purchase. Definitely a Good product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fast shipping/delivery. Came a day earlier than expected. Phone appearance is “as new” and everything functions as it should. Came with a reasonably charged battery to be able to transfer and set-up from previous phone. Daughter loves it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good! Minimal imperfections all functions work well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product was exactly as described. Was shipped quickly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esta en perfectas condiciones muy buena compra total mente satisfecha"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Because the phone was renewed it's not water proof so please don't place it in water.The phone works very good other than the water issue"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks immaculate but the sound sucks - what happened to the volume? Sounds like water damage."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works and looks like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wife loves this phone and me too. The only phone I like better is s20ultra. She got red and the finish is beautiful. Call quality stood out from previous phones as it is exceptionally loud n clear. Sounds like the people you're talking to are right in front of you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is a great phone, great price and I am very happy with buying a renewed phone! The SIM card removal tool was underneath the packaging and I used the end of a paperclip not knowing it was included due to the reviews!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’d rather not add video. But love my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in excellent condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Even though this was a refurbished phone it still looked like new. Works great and came with a 100% battery which was a biggie for us. Came with aftermarket accessories, but that's what the listing said it would have. We are happy with our purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It has some scratches in the body that makes it ugly, but still it works fine. Battery level was at 87%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Equipment in good condition, with 100% battery condition, but it did not arrive in the color that I made in the order, I ordered a purple iphone 11 64Gb and it arrived in black"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Every thing is rigth"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone came with a screen protector installed. Has a small chip in the upper right hand side of the rear glass which appears to be the only blemish on the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone never worked properly had problems right out of the package. I requested a return label sent to my physical address....never came! Now they say it's too late to return. Don't give them a chance to screw you over as well..inus 10 stars"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing find for a present! The person loved their gift and got it for a great price. Easy to transfer info onto new phone and everything runs smoothly! Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m so happy I took a chance and purchased this phone. It’s fantastic"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was almost new but the screen was damaged, the entire left side of the screen didn’t work, letters WSZADQX couldn’t be pressed so I had to pay for a new screen wich cost me 150$"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is great but the battery percentage is on 88% which I believe could have been at least 95% for a renewed iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was worth the money . Fast shipping . It was also unexpected because it came in 4 days before the due date , came in perfect , I thought it would’ve been a scam . But it wasn’t ! Also it was delivered to my door ! It was great ! I do recommend to buy this ! Would I buy it again ? YEEESSS !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone was great com card would fit in com card tray had to return so far have not received A refund Will not re-order until I receive a refund the phone itself looked great but was of no value if you cannot use it as a telephone patiently waiting for a refund"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like everything, except it has a little bit of scratch but overall it’s good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","this was a great purchase recommend to anyone wanting a perfect phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I can not believe that these people did not test this phone. This phone was horrible. First of all, the phone looked ok when I got it. When I turn it on it would not charge up, so it took it to my local carrier and they this phone has not been cleaned out to hold a charge. They cleaned phone out and charge me $5.00 dollars to do that, than took it home and it still would not charge up. Absolutely will return phone, PLEASE , PLEASE vendors check these phone to make sure they work before you sell and send them out."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone has met my expectations."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great deal for the price. Has ran flawless since purchase 3 months ago. No problems with anything so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like this phone upgrade it from a droid so far so good I like the picture quality seems like a pretty good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","What I didn’t like is that the phone came without headphones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I when i got this everything was fine until i looked at the back camera and it cracked so the reg camera works fine but my .5 camera has a crack on the screen i would have returned if i hadn’t found out after i bought a case and screen protector w it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Huge improvemnet from the iphone 6s that i had earlier. hopefully sometime in the future apple will finally listen to us users and improve the battery life on iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came quick, a few scratches on side but screen perfect. Would recommend. Fully unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works fine, light wear on the glass but still a great value compared to new. I activated it on AT&T loving it so far. It replaced my 6s so I was due to upgrade. Would recommend 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not a single scratch in sight. Works just like new. It did not come in the original iphone box though, i don’t care but some people may."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve only had the phone a week and had to get it fixed couldn’t hear anything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The price is more than a brand new one but it was a gift for my daughter so I kept it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The device came in an original box and was in great (like-new) condition. No scrathches at all. The charger is off-brand and charges a bit slow. Get yourself an OEM charger or something more powerful if you don't have one already."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 it's ok, I already have the device thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," it's ok, I already have the device thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone. Was as advertised. Shipping was perfect and right on time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Asta el momento muy bien no ah fallado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this and used it for about two years and recently gifted it to my daughter. It doesn’t act used, even after I used it. Battery life stays long as long as you don’t use with while charging but that’s any phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone come with 1 minimal scratch on the left side(volume button), but in summary is cool.
Battery 93%. Worth the buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone in March to give to my kid sister for her 15th bday. The phone had been working fine for months but then some moisture got it the display and we needed to take it to Apple.

To our surprise, the Apple technician pointed out that someone had opened this phone before to change the display and didn’t do it correctly. So moisture was getting in the phone. Aside from that, whoever did it stripped the nails in the bottom of the phone so we have no way of fixing it.

I contacted the seller but obviously since it’s been months they are saying WE opened the phone and it’s our fault.

Just please be careful who you buy from. It’s bad enough to spend $500 on a phone that was broken.. but to then be accused of having opened it and broken it just too much. We never touched the phone until we took it to Apple.

THE PHONE WAS SOLD TO US WITH STRIPPED NAILS AND A BAD DISPLAY INSTALLATION."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches. Wasn’t included in description, and def not worth the full price of phone. Overall I rather not send it back so I guess I’m dealing w it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego el iphone con 90% de vida de bateria, y un rayon en una de las esquinas del marco. Fuera de eso, contento con la entrega y sin problemas con el equipo renovado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life isn’t great, but the phone itself is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The front speaker of the phone does not function at all, which means that you have to use speaker mode when calling others. The battery life was horrible, and there were at least 5 scratches on the screen, with a chip on the camera. Amazon, renew the phones properly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone looks new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Terrible product. I received this iPhone 11 unlocked. It seemed to have worked good at first. It lasted for 2 months under 90 days. Took it to apple they said it was a software malfunction and nothing can be done. The phone just dropped service one day and it could not be repaired. I hope the people selling these phone do a thorough check of the device before listing it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No issues this far great for price & the 11 is actually bigger than the 13 no scratches or dents great battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the phone. It did not have a mark or flaw on it. Buy with confidence. Saved a lot of money. My only issue is that it’s not holding a charge. I upgraded from a 6 to an 11. Not one issue switching the phone from one to another. I have Straighttalk service. I am in heaven. Not missing the home button either!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llego sin señas de haber sido usado por ottros, y desbloquedo para cualquier operador. Sin duda una buena inversion."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is in very good condition. It is working perfect and looks like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 The only thing is I had to switch phone companies but the phone works great.! Since Boost mobile changed ova it wouldn’t allow me to use my sim so I just changed services and took my number with me.!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","It came looking brand new and works brand new I’ve had no problems with the phone at all it’s had like 2 small scratches but for half the price it’s definitely a good deal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El Face ID le funciona bien, el estado físico del teléfono es bueno, pero la batería no sirve."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I went from an Android to the iPhone. It was so easy to set up, and face recognition was quick. I can go two days before charging it that’s how well the charge holds. I’m really glad I made the switch."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I liked that when I got it there was nothing wrong with the phone. No dislike whatsoever"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We were very pleased with our purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was worried about the phone’s condition at first, however, it was in pristine condition. The phone even had a screen protector on it, and came with its own charger. All in all great quality product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I won hundred percent absolutely love my phone it came with a good battery no nicks no dings no scratches just a perfect phone camera is great have no issues with my phone delivery was smooth transfer was smooth absolutely would buy another phone from this company"
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone keeps saying its not updated, but there is no way to update, phone keeps turning off"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great! My daughter loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered this phone as a present for my grandson’s birthday it was doing good until
One day he was charging it and when he picked it up to take it off charge it was hot the back of the phone was cracked and protruding outward shattered glass back they said that it’s customer damage when we took it to a professional they said it was refurbish damage it was internal battery exploded they refuse to give me full refund or a replacement I do not recommend buying from this company as they cheat you after I called to try to get the replacement they said they didn’t send me the rest of my full refund and still not seen that. So if you want a good product buy elsewhere not here"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The speakers don’t work like they are suppose too. The battery life on the phone isn’t what is should be. The phone did come with a screen protector, which is very good! The phone should at least be checked for faults before sending out at least if your going to pay the amount your paying for just my opinion at least."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my first time buying a phone from Amazon, the phone is in perfect condition besides the fact that the left microphone is defective. The phone does not come with original iPhone charger but it comes with a screen protector."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular vino como nuevo con 100% de batería, ya anteriormente había comprado un IPhone XR para mí, este es para mi pareja y vino mucho mejor que el mío, lo recomiendo completamente o simplemente tuve suerte con ambos, los celulares son desbloqueados ya que son usados en Panama donde vivo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It really comes like it promise in the description."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A newer version of an awesome phone. It’s great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","First the speaker is busted it rattles when the phone rings then when you try to change the tone for txted messages it want change and this was paid in full with the top of line that the seller offers piece of crap I’m surprise Amazon let them sell on their site. Beware of this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego en buen estado, el cargador no es original por lo demás todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Cosmetically excellent, mechanically as advertised. Battery health was about 90% when received. All in all very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this as a gift for my wife, no issues completely unlocked and worked with Mint mobile. Would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wanted cheaper iPhone for my son to buy and could not be happier , great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything about this phone would’ve been perfect, until I tried using speaker phone— it’s extremely muffled. The phones speaker output is defective, so expect flaws with refurbished phones. I’ve never had a negative experience until this purchase but I still can’t entirely hate it. I guess just do more research."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in a weird cinderella box so thought i got scammed but phone is like new nothing wrong with it at all! very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in amazing shape. It didn’t come in it’s original Apple box which is fine and it didn’t come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product was described as excellent with a minimum battery life of 80%. Battery is below that and more blemishes to be called excellent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i was a little weary about buying an iphone from a third party seller, but this phone is amazing quality! it came with an apple charger, and there were absolutely no scratches or damage on the phone. it works like new and the maximum battery capacity was at 100%. it’s super fast and the camera quality is amazing. for about 300 dollars less, it’s an amazing deal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was a really good unlocked phone one thing I ask is if possible to tell which carrier these renewed phones were last on because I did a run around and found out these are gsm phones (tmobile was my carrier) but it turned out great! Brand new phone and not even a scratch. They were nice enough to even put a screen protector on it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone in March and started having problems with it two months later. It completely stop turning on in June and We've been trying to get it fixed . However, Apple can not recognize the battery and now this company won't exchange it for a different one.
I've purchased apple products from Amazon for years and never had a problem such as this one.
Avoid this problem and just pay the apple price. I now have to buy another phone for my daughter. I feel so bad this was her birthday gift and she was so exited."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with a charger and block. The screen was nice and came with a screen protector. It isn’t dirty that is just my mirror. It feels nice and there were no cracks. Love it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was expecting a USED phone (visible signs of) but instead, you can hardly tell that it has been used other that the two (very faint) scratches at the back. The phone works well and was unlocked. Original charger also came with the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in a weird android box (thought I got scammed at first) but inside it were the charger (unoriginal), and the phone. The iPhone 11 came in with a screen protector and was in outstanding conditions. No signs of dents or cracks were found. Overall, good purchase! The phone is basically brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","love this phone! it was refurbished but in excellent condition. unlocked and very easy to get it all set up for my daughter. she has used it for 2 months now and she is very happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Si me agrado pero no valia la opcion de vibracion y tuve q calibrarlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Shipped quickly, arrived in great condition with a screen protector already installed. Everything transferred from old phone and and all features work correctly. Battery life is 100% , this is the 2nd one I’ve ordered and both are still working perfectly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Little details of the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The website guarantees that the battery capacity of this product is not less than 80%. But I only checked 78% battery capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This product had a ton more defects than described. The battery also only had 80% life left. I would have needed to replace the battery within a month. I’m not sure what was refurbished on this. But the battery surely wasn’t."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great deal for $500...Genuine seller...95% performance...
Kudos to Seller.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is like brand new. No scratches. I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Friends, just for you know ""renewed"" is a euphemism for ""used"". You will get a used phone.

My phone had two cosmetic wear signals. The corner of the screen was scratched and it has a dent in the corner."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this puppy refurbished for my wife's bday because I'm cheap. Didn't expect it to continue working as well as it has now almost a year later. Thanks for supporting my frugalness"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasn’t new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldn’t because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There was a problem with the volume on this phone. Unless it was on speaker phone I couldn’t hear the caller. I could not find a reasonable way to exchange, and so I re-ordered and returned the original. However, Amazon decided to refund my account in a gift card to my account , rather than refunding my credit card. Before I realized what had happened, one of my kids placed a small order, paying with the gift card. Thus, Amazon refused to change the refund method. Thus,, I’m left with two phones on my credit card and nearly $400 in Amazon credit. BEWARE!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came earlier than expected and I’m honestly really happy with it :) It’s for sure a good buy the phone looked basically brand new and I love the color!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone started messing up a couple days after use. It also had a small crack on the camera lens."
"Apple","iPhone 11","They will sell the phones and then report it lost or stolen after purchase speaker on phone did not work make sure when you or if you purchase this you check the IMEI on your carrier provider and it will come up on the blacklist of phones that are reported lost or stolen very UPSET WITH THIS PURCHASE I GIVE A ZERO STAR THIS IS A SCAM I WAS SO EXCITED TO START USING THE PHONE TO FIND OUT THAT THE PRODUCTS WAS DAMAGED AND NOT SOLD PROPERLY OR CHECKED PROPERLY DO NOT SELL PHONES AND TELL THEM ITS UNLOCKED OR RENEWED AND THEY WONT WORK"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had this phone for 3months and it has started to glitch and freeze. Buy the warranty package. I purchased another phone with the warranty protection package and I forgot to add the warranty to this phone as well. :(((( the phone works well enough just a minor annoyance."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s a great phone, exactly what I wanted, it works really well, I love Face ID. Battery life is much longer than older iPhones, and I’m glad it doesn’t have the fingerprint reader anymore. Really good value."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a bit skeptical about buying an iPhone renewed off amazon instead of new but my worries were soon gone after the iPhone came in without any damages and at 100% battery health. Besides not getting the official iPhone box with the earphones, I still received a working charger/power adapter & a screen protector installed on the iPhone already. Very satisfied with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition good , fingerprint works well and battery life great ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Loved the phone just popped my sim in and it works the screen was gorgeous no problems I love my 11 so much thank u and greatest value for your money please buy and it came a day early"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived with scratches on the case. Definitely NOT in excellent condition as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 11","DO NOT BUY THIS!! I was so exited to to unpack my new phone and it looked Brand new. Then after using it for a day it just started turning off while I was using it, and it would be completely charged. It’s been a week now and I can’t even use it, it turns of after using it for 2 minuets!! And it won’t even charge now I’ve plugged it in for hours and it won’t charge defiantly returning!! I guess you do get what you pay for"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone and all but ain't loud enough. on a call is hard to hear and alarms as well.my wife has the same phone and we compared them and results that my wife's phone is way louder than this one. that's why I would like a replacement or refund. Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with defects, lines on the screen, in the LCD, not scratches. Return was not the standard Amazon simple return, and I had to pay for shipping."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery at 76%👎"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great,looks good worth the money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived on time and looks and works like new. It was a great value for the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It doesn't works. The Face ID doesn't works, the apps suddenly stop to function and the camera is not working. Take care with this seller.Definitely, this iPhone is useless"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone faulty, returned it about two weeks ago and still haven't gotten my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen seems to be not working as it should."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought the phone in April 2022 it died today, December 9, 2022"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in a good condition and works well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was worried to buy this because it was a pretty big purchase for me but I am glad I did! It came a day earlier then expected, the only issues are very small cosmetic blemishes that I couldn’t even get good pictures of and set up was super easy. If you’re worried, don’t be the $ difference makes it worth it for sure"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly , I don’t write reviews .. but with a purchase this expensive, it’s worth it☺️My phone is great!! I’ve had no problems with it !! Highly recommend 💕💕"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I can count over 10 times I’ve received phones with batteries under 80% from this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m IN LOVE with this phone and the fact that it’s like brand new and unlocked just made it better for me. Seriously it was like buying a brand spanking new iPhone for a much lower price. The camera quality is why I wanted this phone to begin with but everything else just makes the phone so great. I’m very happy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Loved it from the touch and the color to how fast it works and how well the face recognition works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came almost new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After a week of using this phone, it stopped charging. Now we have to pay extra to have it fixed bc we already switched the service to this phone.I prefer Android usually but my son really wanted an iPhone. I'd say we'll never buy a refurbished phone from Amazon again and not knowing if it's just an Apple issue, we'll never buy an Apple product again either."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo como descrito. Excelente producto estoy muy satisfecha."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó en el tiempo indicado, sin ningún detalle físico. Condición de Batería al 100%, me encanto el producto."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone a few months ago and wanted to wait before writing a review. Overall, I am very happy with it. No glitches or bugs, minimal scratches on the back. I recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s pretty good all and all, but I bought the phone on July 2nd and the battery health drains REALLY fast. I got it at 94% and now it’s at 90% which is pretty fast for an iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There were two pretty noticeable cracks on the screen when I received the phone but other than that it was in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just returned it because I found it at a better price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I didn't know that I would have to find a provider for this phone. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I searched for two weeks after Verizon stated that it would cost well over 600$ to upgrade. Best decision to buy renewed and couldn’t be happier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No visible flaws and everything worked great,absolutely no complaints"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So this iPhone 11 I just spent around 400$ Says it was refurbished LOL. Only thing is... the ear speaker AND loud speaker are 100% garbage. Need to make a call? Oh wait let me put my headphones in so I can hear anything!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in very good condition. It was as advertised, very very minor scratches only noticeable when phone was up close, not visible at arms length. I highly recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just got my phone today, and unboxed my phone cautiously. I found a scratch on my phone, it was not worth buying when theres something wrong. I really thought it would be brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I enjoyed the iPhone 11 despite couple of scratches on the phone but it randomly says SIM card error while I’m in middle of call or sending msg. Which is very frustrating."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical getting the phone but for the price it works perfectly it does everything an apple product is supposed to. Now it didn’t come in the original packaging which I didn’t mind. And the charging cable is long which I find a bonus. Overall I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I feel this phone is okay but had glitches and problems from the beginning!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El funcionamiento es ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was defective from the start. We opened the phone today as it was a git for my wife. I placed the phone on the charger since the battery was very low. I noticed it had not charged at all after 4 hours on the charger and was now almost dead. Luckily I was able to get into the settings menu before the battery completely died to see that the issue was with the battery installed in the phone. I requested a refund immediately. Wife was happy but now is upset with this product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There are both side of mobile have scratch mark when I am not satisfied with sailor because of when bought the mobile that time nothing to show about scratch mark"
"Apple","iPhone 11","got the phone super fast and it was unlocked and ready to go! super happy with it, it’s been 3 months now since my purchase and i haven’t run into any problems."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in great condition, no scratches, no sign of previous use. 5/5"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is great! Even came with a fast charger!! That just saved me 40 Bucks. Although the battery life said it was at 91% So it obviously had been used."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Waste of time ordering this damaged and bad battery life. See video and pics. I thought I’d take a chance but it wasted my time."
"Apple","iPhone 11"," Waste of time ordering this damaged and bad battery life. See video and pics. I thought I’d take a chance but it wasted my time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this as a gift roughly 2 years ago, well less than a year Into having the phone it needed to be replaced as it couldn't update or hold a charge and the battery was slowly draining from its ""full capacity"" of 80%. Disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When we received the phone everything was great. It was in perfect condition and we were very happy with it. The problems came when we inserted the sim card. It wouldn't work so we took it to our phone carrier and they let us know that the phone was reported stolen. We were sold a STOLEN phone. And because it was reported stolen apples system does not allow the phone to be activated through a phone career until the phone is retuned to the original owner. I contacted the seller and they never got back to us. I contacted customer service and still nothing. So the phone was not unlocked it was a stolen phone. Be careful."
"Apple","iPhone 11","screen had a big scratch going diagonal across it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nothing too great. Definitely had a lot of scratches. Battery health was at 81%. Box was a random one. Fulfills the bare minimum but I would definitely go for a new iphone over this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Salió perfecto exepto un pequeño rayoncito en la pantalla y aus accesorios no eran los originales pero lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received the phone and it will not turn on. The apple logo turns off and on."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Acceptable condition was bought. Came extremely dirty. Scratches distort text I don’t think it’s acceptable as it hinders function. Can’t read text properly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So, bought this for my daughter and it is NOT unlocked! Metropcs gave her a card to use somewhere who will unlock it for her, but this is really really bad. She uses her phone for work, and now has no phone until she can get this done. A real inconvenience."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My son says that the battery life is great it last for the whole day. It came in great condition just a little minor catching on the phone but the rest is good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was advertised and unlocked, meaning it is not locked to a specific cell phone carrier. This was NOT the case. The phone was locked to T-mobile, and still had a T-mobile SIM card inside. I would assume this is most likely a clerical error, because I know these phones are often purchased with the appropriate carrier in mind."
"Apple","iPhone 11","this was my first phone so I was pretty nervous getting it. But when I did I LOVED it! It even came 2-5 days earlier too. It has just been some hours but it feels like 2 months. The camera is very good. Would recommend buying it c:."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The package came on time, but when opened the only thing in the box was a charger, SIM card, and a (broken) screen protector. There was NO phone! This is a TOTAL SCAM!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! It even came with a screen protector. Looks brand new! Thank you so much!! It says it’s locked for only Verizon but I’m on cricket and it works just fine. I love this phone it’s amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased the iPhone 11 from Hybrid IT a week ago , it arrived on time . As with any renewed phone I check to make sure everything is working , Cameras , Face recognition , Speakers . Everything was looking good then I went to see if the wireless charging works ,an it didn’t connect . I thought well maybe it’s my charger , So I took it to APPLE and low and behold the wireless charging back does not work .

When buying renewed phones I’m aware there may be some cosmetic scuffs or scratches but when something is internally wrong with the phone like the last one sold to me with a broken speaker from hybrid . Are ya’ll not checking your phones before you send them out bcs at this point it feels like it ?? This is ridiculous .

I’ve called them multiple times and they won’t answer I need a replacement phone or my money back!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciona perfecto. Los accesorios no son originales pero funcionan perfectamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical on how the phone would be due to some of the 1 star reviews but I received mine this morning and it’s amazing. It looks brand new and the battery life was at 100% literally nothing wrong with it. I’m so happy and it also came 2 days early"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came unlocked as stated and is real and authentic iPhone 11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am not happy with this phone. I ordered iPhone 11 256gb. It looks good externally but comes with 84% battery efficiency. Really? What the hell i paid almost $500 for this? I am returning this back. Just don’t feel happy by looking at this externally, please look at the battery efficiency."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it,no complaints"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo bien y buen servicio"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Kept dropping calls. Return iPhone. Ordered another one from different seller. It’s working like a charm"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Many scratches all over the phone. It barley looked like they took the time to clean it. Everything works so far however."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life is amazing it last me a whole day, it took me awhile to get use to not having a home button but one thing i do like is the camera quality"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We got the phone. It was 128G instead of 256G. It didn’t work. We returned it. They said Amazon had an issue with the refund. They still haven’t refunded us."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone so far! Came a day earlier than Amazon said which is great! Also received a screen protector and phone case for free!!! Thank you. So far couldn’t be happier with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone could not charge up. The recharge port did not work. Was not happy at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Although it’s a renew phone according what the headline says in the marketplace, I can say it’s a new phone. Beautiful and perfect presentation. This seller has a good service and a fast shipping option, I got my iPhone on time and hope the next one I buy would be under the same conditions both the phone and the shipping"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bateria a menos del 93% de rendimiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone as a gift and was as expected. Small dings on the back side but no major defect and the phone works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First time purchaser.I was hopeful that I would get a phone in a decent enough shape to gift, but unfortunately, the phone arrived with deep unremovable scratches on the front glass, which is a bit odd because they are supposed to be gorilla-glass quality glass. Now Im having to attempt to re-purchase in hopes to get another one in better quality in time for Christmas, I hope this process becomes more effective."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great. Has a few very small scratch on the bottom near the charging port but nothing that you would even see with a case on."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life on phone is less than 85 percent! Doesn't last long!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone box with accessories arrived on time but there was no phone in the box! I'm still waiting for the refund after almost three weeks."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought an iPhone 11 from this seller. The phone came with minor details in the screen, only visible under light. The battery was at full capacity. Totally recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall it was great for the price and everything is perfect except just a couple tiny scratches on the back but besides from that it’s great and I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything works perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","besides the headline the battery charged to 100%, didn't use the fingerprint scanner and the facial recognition worked fine. oh by the way the phone was locked to a company that was absorbed into another company so i had to return it instead of getting it unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es genial! Funciona perfecto y la batería no se gasta tan rapido"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono llegó en aparente buenas condiciones y empezó a tener problemas el altavoz a los dos meses.A los 95 dias de la compra la pantalla dejó de funcionar. Me puse en contacto con el vendedor y no se ha querido hacer cargo de la reparación.No recomiendo comprar articulos reacondicionados a este vendedor, es un timo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Said product was in excellent condition but had small scratch on screen and only one speaker working. will have to return and go thru the whole process of going to t- mobile and having service switched to another phone all over again. Unsure whether to trust renewed/ refurbished again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Probablemente de las mejores compras que he realizado. Básicamente me enviaron un iPhone 11 rojo nuevo y desbloqueado. Mi compañía telefónica es Claro y todo funciona al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I paid over 500 for this phone from this seller and I don't usually review but they don't respond to messages. This phone screen went black in less then a year after purchases. No cracks no damage. It's a little much for less then a year so buyer beware."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 it came sooner than expected ! great investment hardly any cosmetic defects, and it came with a 100% batter capacity ! awesome :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," it came sooner than expected ! great investment hardly any cosmetic defects, and it came with a 100% batter capacity ! awesome :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone from a random seller but I still proceeded to purchase the phone. I'm so glad I did because the phone came in PERFECT condition. No scratches or cracks anywhere along the phone. It even came with a screen protector on the phone and even one for the back camera."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It arrived before expected, was well packed,with no damage I could see. The phone seems to work well and I’ve had no problems with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono está en muy buen estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this back in October because my old iPhone wasn’t working properly. The phone came in within 2 days of purchase. In perfect condition and never had a single issue. Definitely worth it and cheaper than buying at any store!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not able to hear the voice properly. I am getting very low voice during call & Phone screen was broken. Courier package is not good. Not received original phone charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","had scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived quickly and packaged perfectly. The receivers couldn't have been more pleased. Great quality. I'm very happy with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i bought this phone twice the first time my bottom half was glitching then i refunded it and got a new one and i love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I use this phone for work"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Beautiful basically brand new phone. Works perfectly and had no signs of use, just very minor surface scratches (i really had to look for them, theyre not noticeable) great battery great price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone in august you would think that the phone would be great everything worked but I recently went to turn the phone on with my carrier and they told me I cannot turn it on because the serial number is locked beware people these phone may not be compatible with your card"
"Apple","iPhone 11","You roll the dice with every Amazon purchase and this one is no exception. I see other reviews saying their phone was equivalent to a brand new phone, this was not my experience. This phone has visible scuff marks around the outside of the chassis and scratches and gouges on the back panel. The screen didn’t have any noticeable blemishes and looked to me to be a brand new screen. I had ordered a Verizon phone but received an unlocked phone so visual voicemail will not function. Since this was about an average Amazon experience, and returning something to Amazon is a nightmare, I’ll keep the phone. If you go renewed keep in mind, you might be paying the same price for a blemished phone as someone payed for a near perfect phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was actually legit and it just had one minor scratch but nothing too big and brought a screen protector. Very happy with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came in only two days. The phone came with a sturdy charger and charging box. The phone also came with a glass screen protector on it which I REALLY appreciate bc I can NEVER get mine on perfectly. This one is on PERFECTLY. the battery life was at 100%. In perfect condition. Even came w ab 80% battery."
"Apple","iPhone 11","For the price it would cost to fix the screen, I could get a brand new phone… no thanks.

Disappointed because I’ve bought refurbished phones from Amazon before and had a great experience. Sadly, this was a waste of time and money. Returning"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s nice to buy something and use it right away. I put my Sim card in it, works perfectly. No having to call phone carriers to unlock codes just put your Sim card in it, set it up like a new phone would be set up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Shipped VERY fast. Popped my SIM card right in and had no problem ever since. Came with no scratches or cracks, perfect condition. I love my new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was a purchase for my teenage son. He has had this phone now for about three months and loves everything about it. The camera has so many features, it’s truly incredible. The lightning fast charge really works. I wouldn’t be afraid to by renewed from Amazon. This is a great quality phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered it yesterday and it was at my door by noon. It’s really good price for a unlocked phone few dinks you can barely see overall I’m very satisfied with my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was hesitant to get a ""renewed"" phone, but it has worked just as well as advertised. I'm very happy with it and would renewed again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The best phone that I’ve had. My battery last a very long time, it’s super fast, no scratches, it’s like this is a brand new phone and don’t get me started on the cameras..... I have found my true love 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My son has had this phone for several days now and hasn't had to charge it yet, and he's so incredibly happy with it's photography capabilities compared to his previous iPhone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ok, but not great. First phone arrived with a scratch on the screen, so I returned and bought another. The 2nd phone arrived and the battery heath is at 86%, so I’m sure I’ll have to replace soon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've tried the other resellers and been disappointed. Totally happy with my experience and would use them again for sure. Now if I can just get my young adult children to stop destroying their phones!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very fast shipping! I received my phone in one day! Great experience buying with this seller. Phone in perfect condition and came with charger. Love it! Highly recommend this seller!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No scratches, beautiful color, came in 100% battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Can not use for out going coll for my t mobile simcard"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it’s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone didn’t come in original boxing or an original charger however the phone is decent. It had battery capacity of 97% But it doesn’t have any scratches or anything."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was a gift for family member"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came right on time with a special pink gift on the inside (Case), it also had the charger and the block come with it as well. Would definitely order again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome reliable I prefer this to any new iPhone comers"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little skeptical about buying an iPhone off of amazon but I’m super happy with this phone it was brand new and came with a full battery. It was very easy to set up...and it is fully unlocked so you can get any type of phone carrier you want. Definitely would recommend people to buy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it, noticed small damaged by the charge port and scratches on the screen.. my battery is significantly damaged and needs replacement… you’d think with a renewed phone at that price that you’d get a good battery… oh well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","A BIG NO! Battery was at 83% in setting. Then it’s not actually fully unlocked!! Don’t waste your time!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Renewed isn't really renewed... it is just plain average used. It is supposed to be no defects within twelve inches. Phone has a scratch at full arms reach that is visible on the screen. If still visible once I put the screen protector on, I will likely return. I am now suspect on what the battery life is going to be."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone looked beautiful but it did not work for me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Have not reviewed. It was given to someone as a gift."
"Apple","iPhone 11","had no scratches, it definitely was unlocked, and fast loading. would order from them again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La verdad decia que estaba desbloqueado pero en realidad no es asi, todo lo demas bien pero que no este desbloqueado le quita todo lo bueno."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had my phone for about a week now. No scratches anywhere on the iPhone and it’s internally sound. I’ve had no problems whatsoever."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El vendedor aseguraba que la batería era mayor al 80% y en buen estado y al encender el teléfono encontré esta leyenda “tu batería se halla en una condición muy degradada”Adjunto imagen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I admit, I was a little skeptical first. Spending $700 on an unknown seller, but after reading some reviews I went for it. The phone looks just like new, no cosmetic damage, works perfectly well. I got mine unlocked and activated it to my carrier same day. I upgraded from a 6s so big change!!! Loving it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything running perfect until now"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived with small damage to screen protector. Otherwise everything is fine."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was worried it would not be authentic but it is. Ofc it didn’t come with the original apple box and earbuds but its fine. It came with the charger but not an apple charging brick just a regular white one I dont mind though It charges pretty fast. Overall It was worth the money :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone stopped working,contacted the seller and no response"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came with a 98 percent battery life no cracks or scratches on the phone it was perfectly fine it looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly it was because of the reviews why I trusted the seller. And it was worth it. Can’t complain no scratches no damage no issues what so ever. I wild recommend anyone to them. I use metro pcs as my carrier and they do support this phone. Plus I get to keep my bill low. Win win."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product had a few scratches and only charges with the charger that came with it. Other than that, its perfect! :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Charger broke first time used. Otherwise phone is as promised and performs properly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far the phone is working perfect! This is the 2nd refurbished iPhone I have purchased and I am very pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My husband got this phone for me for Christmas and honestly I was skeptical about the phone but when I opened it up I was happy with no scratches and battery life is good thank you Amazon 😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was so excited to get this phone because I had to replace mine just to find out this is worst then the one I have now. I have to get the battery replaced already and it got hot right when I turned it on. The water mark on the screen is ridiculous like everything was replaced but the battery and screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone was in the best condition. No scratches no dents. Battery health was on 86% however that did t phase me because it’s working flawlesslyThe face is on point no hiccups"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen is scratched up. It’s distracting especially in the sun! 89% battery health. I live Trinidad so I would just have to deal with it…."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The regular iPhone 11 is small for me. Therefore I returned it. I am a former Android owner so using a iPhone is way different. Went back to ads and Android."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone wasn’t unlocked, which no one figured out until I had wasted HOURS with online customer support… going back to Amazon, and I’m sooo pissed I wasted so much time to still NOT HAVE A PHONE"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I’m still happy that I did."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received phone and spent 4 hours doing updates with battery life when received was 50%, they advertise 80%. Phone was NOT UNLOCKED!!! I cannot use this phone at all!!! And now seller will not contact me!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works great. Got here early. Had a small issue with a different purchase and found their customer service is great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone works good but came with small scratches on screen. Not worth the same price as a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks amazing and sounds amazing. I love everything about it. WAY BETTER THAN SAMSUNG!! I suggest this phone to everyone. It is a great buy. It is a 100% new even thought it is being resold. It has no fault. Might as well call it new. I am super happy with this phone. :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very nice phone for much less than new, but like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Get yourself a iPhone 11, 11pro or 12 and you will never use android again. Take a loan and get one!!! it would money well spent. More features and capacity than you will ever use."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Charger didn’t work"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The description and price was for ""like new"" condition. Yet the phone had a sticker on the front screen that left residue all over it and the screen had a ton of scratches. I wouldn't call that like new at all. Overall I would never buy from them again. Clearly false advertising."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it. Camera quality is very good. Shipping fast. Battery life last longer. Phone was overall in good condition, but the box did arrive smashed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","scraches and chips all over the phone screen and edges of the phone. the phone was completely dead on arival. charger that came with is dose not work. just over all bad product and refurbished phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Speaker was broken, could not hear the caller. Help to fix this did not work. Had to return the phone. Also the flash lite cover was punctured. Flash lite worked but the phone looked damaged."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the IPhone 11 and everything worked fine but the speakers were damaged. It was a hard ware failure so I had to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone started malfunctioning after a month of use and then altogether stopped working. And remember to remove your sims card when returning because I forgot mine in the phone…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in great quality aside from a bunch of scratches on the screen. Aside from those slight annoyances it is otherwise like brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not pleased with this product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good haven’t had any problems with any apps with service I love my phone it came a day early very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was pretty worried about getting a refurbished phone off of amazon but this is definitely worth the buy! It doesn’t come in the Apple box or has earphones but the phone is in amazing condition! It looks brand new and has full battery capacity but also it comes with A tempered glass screen protector on the phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is everything it’s cracked up to be. Take great pics, long lasting battery plus an easy to use touchscreen."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the product in a timely manner, there are no scratches on the device. It was exactly as described and works great!! The battery life came 100%. Great customer service. I would recommend to anyone and I would purchase from them again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have not had any problems whatsoever. There was not a single mark in this phone it looked brand new. So far it’s working fine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this a little over a week ago the description says it had barely noticeable scratches but it has a huge scratch on the screen it’s about one fourth of the screen and if I use it more than half hour it overheats"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Brand new iPhone no problems no scratches I love it !!!! I was scared thinking it was going to be a scam but it’s real and worth every dollar"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Dislike that I couldn’t hear hardly on the phone after a week of receiving the phone! Plus it acted as if it had/has water damage !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s definitely not a scam, true color & true iPhone setup! but I’m also upset that my phone came with scars. Be aware if you buy this phone it will come with scars."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Can’t get the phone to pick up any Bluetooth"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life was okay at 86 percent but the audio for this phone was so bad that u can’t hear anything would not recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Absolutely love the 11 , face recognition easy to use, battery life last a long time. Touch screen easy to adjust too."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This item arrived about a few months ago and so far there have been no issues. Time will tell."

"Apple","iPhone 11","79% battery life, and never go more than lte signal"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived within a week. It came nicely packaged with a charger and it has a screen protector on already. BuySpry is a great seller, I 100% recommend purchasing from them. I have no problems with my phone, I absolutely love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The one I received was locked to a T-mobile carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face rec was too quick for me even wearing sunglasses it worked so I don’t use it I worry about scams"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good quality"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just got my phone today and got it activated with cricket and it works perfectly the only thing is right now there is a small black shadow at the bottom of my screen that just started if in the next couple days it won't go away I will send it back but other than that I LOVE IT!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter love it I was scared to open it but when I did it was perfect the color was great the screen was good my daughter love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The audio on the call is terrible, the sound is super low and the iPhone always says liquid has been detected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I do not want a credit note I returned this item it was faulty and cannot get my money refunded and I can’t find an email address to complain or get help with this refund. Very frustrating and I keep leaving feed back to no response"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've always bought refurbished iphones off Amazon, so I expected this to be just as good an experience. The first phone I bought was great for a week, then started getting glitchy. The screen image would vibrate, and the colors would change in and out. So sent it back and got a second. The second phone was also great for a week. Then it would stop responding to my finger swipes, or suddenly shift from screen to screen without my having done anything. The not responding to my finger swipes was SO frustrating. I couldn't even turn it off to rest it and reboot. So I finally went directly to apple and am only paying $50 for a brand new phone. This definitely wasn't worth the hassle."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very nice seller! The yellow is gorgeous! Even included a beautiful neon pink clear case! My 13 year old daughter loves it! It’s he first iPhone! Thanks!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came like brand new, with no back scratches and a glass screen protector already applied also has 100% Maximum battery capacity. It’s only about 100 dollars cheaper than on apple's online store and does not include the Apple iphone box, earbuds or charger."

"Apple","iPhone 11","It came just fine and the box said “Smart Phone for Smart People” No Fast charger But It’s still good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am here doubting whether this phone is pre owned. I can't tell it's not knew! Battery life still on top game, no scratches perfect camera. Only that it came without a USB cable, which was easy to grab."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love the look… but I had ordered for it to be compatible with an AT&T phone and it is not."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not happy with this purchase. It said it was unlocked but it would not accept the sims card for Verizon service.. Never got a signal. Returned for a refund. Waiting on the refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was an amazing buy from Kiss Electronics. No issues with phone operation so far, only just received & setup. Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","iPhone immediately crashed when I set it up and I lost all my data. . Was forced to send it back. Couldn’t get to the mail in time and have been charged fully for a complete broken iPhone. Horrible"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is a little heavier than I expected but so far I love it. The screen is great and the camera is great. It’s easy to use and it was easy to set up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Mine came with a glass screen protector attached, so I think I got a returned phone, but I didn’t mind. There were no scratches on the phone anywhere, so it was basically a free screen protector.Otherwise, it’s a great phone and this refurbished model works like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was 50 % changed and packaged right but the screen has 2 big scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived in good condition but a few days after the 3 month warranty expired the touch screen stopped working. Contacted the seller to see if they would make an exchange and was told to go to Best Buy. This is the second Amazon refurbished phone we’ve bought that has had trouble after only a few months. If you only want a working phone for three months then this is the place to shop."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Terrible product. I purchased it a few weeks ago, and within a couple days the apps stopped opening properly. A little after that the screen started to glitch a pink color and the phone started restarting randomly on its own. Be warned if you buy this, you have to pay for your own return shipping and it is not free like many of Amazons merchants. Extremely disappointed with the product and will not be purchasing another refurbished iphone from the seller."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little concerned to buy a phone off the internet from a 3rd party—but my good friend recommended it. i bought it for my husband and he loves it!! It’s perfect and cheaper to buy it this way with a credit card than to get one from a phone store! I definitely recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone worked just as expected. looked brand new. Bought for my son and he has no complaints"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen had watermarks"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Little lame that it only has max 88% battery life but the phone is in amazing shape. Even came with a glass screen protector already on it. Overall great experience."
"Apple","iPhone 11","amazing the real deal for cheappp"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great condition, no noticeable irregularities. Haven't tried the facial recognition yet."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was skeptical as well. Although it came faster than expected and was perfect it felt like a new phone from Apple expect for obvious reasons. Nothing is different about this phone expect for where you are getting it from. Mines came fully unlocked working no scratches or cracks.. Stellar phone In general"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought it thinking I’d get a phone with some type of defect but it looks brand new, no dents or scratches. Battery capacity is 100%. Really happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect brand New would have never thought I would buy a phone off Amazon and I’m so glad I did I saved over $200"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had no issues with this phone. I don’t think it needs to be thinner or thicker. Feels right the way it is. Face recognition works, although I hope there is an update soon that can also recognize you with a covid protection mask."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was impressed that it already came with a screen protector and the phone is as brand new as it could be :) It was in perfect condition! Thank you!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Well I wasn't going to write a review but hopefully it'll help someone in the future...I bought this phone for my son and took it to our carrier who informed me that this phone wasn't unlocked and had 2 MEI numbers we even called Apple who then informed us that the phone would only work overseas. I returned it without a problem and received a full refund, which I'm very thankful for because this phone wasn't cheap and it kept powering on and off by itself which was unusual."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone looks new and the shipping was amazingly quick."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just got the iPhone 11 and says the battery is not a Apple product after we hooked it up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Horrendous customer service and equally bad products!!! Every device (whether purchased or warranty replaced) has been defective. Verizon even told us with this last device that they did not even recognize the serial numbers for the phone).The phone worked fine for 2 months before starting to have problems. It will not send / receive data unless connected to Wi-Fi ... even with an unlimited plan and full coverage area. Yes, we are 2 werks past the refund period ... but you would certainly think this seller would try to make things right by sending a replacement (which, by the way, would be the 4th phone in a few month period). All they do is blame Amazon for their policies (instead of giving appropriate customer service).A waste of $600!!!Be wise and DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The seller sent me a defective phone. The SIM card reader did not work with any of my sims."
"Apple","iPhone 11","100% battery life, came with a screen protector. No scratches on the screen. Only thing that was imperfect was a slight smudge type scratch on the back that was roughly about a quarter of an inch to half an inch. It’s not that visible however and worth the discounted price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m really enjoying my phone . It works great a f looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my first time ever writing a review on Amazon. Bought this phone a week ago and it didn’t work, I took it to Verizon after not being able to use it, and they said it was most likely a stolen one and was unusable. I ended up buying one from them and have had no issues. Trust me, it’s better to spend a couple hundred dollars more than to buy one like this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I went from an IPhone6 to this phone. After the culture/adjustment shock, I am loving it. Ii received it promptly and it was even better than described"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great Buy! I love this phone! It’s in great shape! Works great! Highly recommend you get it if you looking to pay a used phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was great how the phone came with a screen protector on already. I went out to go buy some without knowing, but now I have extra screen protectors. The shipping was really fast as well. Ordered it and got it within two days to my surprise."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it somethings don’t work which is weird but it’s alright"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expected🤗🤗)and it is absolutely lovely🤩. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.😁😁✅"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone had me like wow when I got it but it didn’t come with an charger but it’s still a great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is amazing. When I received the package it didn’t come with any scratches. Also, the battery works amazing!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had for about a month now and no complaints! Works like new and arrived with no scratches, dents or problems!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","volvería a comprar de nuevo. Cero arrepentimiento. Estéticamente 97 de 100."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone. In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system. Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system. We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone flat died. This was a blessing in that the move into it was simple and fast. About half what new phone would cost."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone has been on this software update screen for 2 hours I can’t get to any other settings because it’s still saying updating the phone was completely dead when I got it but it’s connected to Wi-Fi and is currently charged now with 50% battery so I’m not understanding why the phone is taking so long to update I even powered the phone off and tried again still the same results I will be returning it for a full refund phone has few scratches on front screen that aren’t really noticeable I can’t get in the phone to even see how everything else works and I’m tired of waiting on the software to download so I’m powering it back off and returning it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me encanta"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone and immediately checked it out, thought all was well and began switching my old phone over. It wasn't until the point where you have to speak into the phone to train your voice that I realized it couldn't hear me. Had to send it back and wait 2 weeks for refund before I could order another. Not fun but nothing I could do."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great iPhone! Have had no problems with it, it came completely unlocked and ready to go all I had to do was put my SIM card in it and I was ready to go! It had ZERO scratches or marks on it. Well worth the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in perfect condition also had a screen protector already on so that was cool. Battery usually lasts me the whole day"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn’t allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn’t get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don’t have anymore … at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon’s renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was good condition, but didn’t come with earphone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I think I got a pretty good deal, very pleased"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it! It was just like new, the battery life was at 100."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Review said like new but the screen was badly scratched up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Although a refurbished phone, it is defective. When I receive a call, the phone rings loud twice and then lowers while still ringing. The battery life takes a while to charge. I am unable to set the voicemail which is a simple task. The phone was guaranteed refurbished which means all of the above should have been checked. I did pay for insurance and have time to return the phone but what an inconvenience. There are absolutely no excuses sir."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works perfectly fine as if it’s brand new!!! was skeptical at first but it’s fully unlocked and it’s definitely worth the purchase !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Loved it. Basically brand New. No cracks and battery life was 88%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The corners are beaten and scraped"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had to return. Didn’t work at all out of the box.I returned it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Seria un regalo para mi hermana pero llego en pésimas condiciones, con la parte de atrás estrellada y la pila tenía solo 75% de vida útil( siendo que esperábamos uno teléfono reacondicionado en excelente condición) preferimos un reembolso y estamos esperándolo."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Was very happy with the Excellent condition of the phone only had it one day seems to be operating perfectly fine!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This product claimed that the phone was like new, and it was not at all as advertised. The phone had a very noticeable scratch on the back, which is annoying, but what really got to me is that the camera doesn't work. Whenever I open the camera to use it, the camera keeps attempting (and failing) to adjust. It vibrates the phone profusely and makes it so that I can only use the front facing camera on this phone. Absolutely not worth the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agrado la pantalla, tiene un raya que perturba o incomoda la vista en la parte superior izquierda donde aparece la hora"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery life was around 98% when I received it, and the only cosmetic damage it had was a few fine scratches on the back. It’s perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Over very good - wish earbuds were included"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was in good condition and worth the price. Only problem was they shipped FEDEX who miss routed it and it arrived two days late"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Batería al 100%, ningún rayon y básicamente nuevo. La mejor compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Fully satisfied!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exactly as described, I was a little hesitant and did a lot of research before purchasing but it is definitely work it! Does not come in original Apple packing, so you won’t get an apple charger, or any other accessories. However it does come with a new charger."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo excelente,.lo único que nonestpy de acuerdo es que no venía en empaque y accesorios originales"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone came in perfect condition the phone itself is unlocked however when I went to put my SIM card in it wouldn’t work it was showing that it was locked I contacted my carrier I even brought it in they said the person I got the phone from had locked the sim meaning it doesn’t work I don’t recommend buying AT ALL!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Según es un producto excelente y tiene demasiada rayada la pantalla"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with screen protector and works so well and is so fast!!! I def recommend!:)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone from a seller called Tech exchangee on February 19 2022. It is now May 31 2022 and the phone is dead because of a faulty logic board and the seller will not honor a replacement. I took it to an apple shop and the phone had been sent in for service in 2019 because of a FAULTY LOGIC BOARD and apple would not honor any purchase, so replacement would be $400. Don’t buy Amazon refurbished items. It’s not worth the risk."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Aftermarket Apple Parts not installed OEM after 90 days of the warranty if something goes wrong apples not going to help you nobody's going to help you with the phone is no good it's a crying shame they sell these things the warranty there is none you got 90 days to return it through Amazon and that's all you got there's errors that pop up because the parts have been replaced with aftermarket parts not Apple approve parts so the phone already recognized it's been tampered with so Apple won't even touch it because they already know it's been tampered with by somebody else waste of your time wasting your money trying Shane that's what you get for shopping on Amazon"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La parte de la cámara vino toda rayada y la pantalla igual llena de rayones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Really good phone. Great price. Box was opened inside the package but it was still orginally sealed. Phone works great with tmobile service. Sim card transfer was a piece of cake. This is my first iPhone ever but so far I am liking the quality of the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The packaging was great. Delivery was fast. The case is great quality. All of the little extras and the detail is also great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agrado la pantalla me vino rayada es lo único, el resto si fue una buena inversion"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had everything transferred to my new phone, when suddenly my first phone call came in. To my surprise, you could barely hear any sound through the speaker despite the volume being turned up to max! Just my luck that the speaker doesn’t work considering I’m blind. Oh well, please give me my money back, and properly test your stuff.UPDATE- after ordering a brand new iPhone 11, which was not much more expensive than this renewed version, I realized that they didn’t even put the correct screen on the one I received from the seller. broken speaker, and incorrect screen. What else will I find wrong next? well, nothing, because I’m sending it back for a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great price and basically brand new! This phone was very easy to set up and I love the upgrade from a 7 !"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered the phone in green color but was sent a red one instead. The condition of the phone was far from ""excellent""; it had multiple, very visible scratches all across the surface and around the camera. Had to return."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love my new phone, I’ve had it for a few months Ans works great no problems great battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looked brand new, but you could hardly hear callers and the media volume couldn't be turned up to medium. It would become unresponsive at times as well. Why does Amazon only sell refurbished iPhones?"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Less than a week old I got an error that there is a non-Apple battery. Now it won’t start up, it cycles through bringing up the Apple logo and then shuts off. Returning it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Does not recognize any SIM card. Returning it for a refund. Do not buy! QA is bad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very fast shipping easy process excellent product! It was exactly what they showed it to be! Great buyer experience"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy satisfecha me gusto mucho bino como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything looks great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","100% real.. brand new phone... battery health on 100. No scratches or dents came charger and block no headphone but I have my AirPods so it’s ok. Will definitely buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciona excelente y estéticamente muy bueno."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am Loving this phone! Can’t even tell it’s refurbished and came earlier than expected. I’ll keep you updated when I’ve had it long enough but so far so good! Clean and came with a screen protector already"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought iPhone 11 as an unlock, but it was not.They charge a lot of money for a phone that does not work."
"Apple","iPhone 11","it says it’s unlocked but it’s not. so irritated that i wasted my time. do NOT buy this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works 100%.Great value for the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bad packaging and some scratches on the screen but overall decent. keeping it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased a purple iphone 11 that was supposed to be fully unlocked, but it was actually locked by Sprint Carrier. I am furious because the headline is misleading that all the phones are fully unlocked. This phone was supposed to be for my daughter's birthday and her gift is ruined!! Buyer beware!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Price was too good to be true. Now I have to wait 14 days (up to 30 days) for a refund. Replacement was not an option. Amazon “renew” guarantee didn’t mean anything for this transaction. 3rd party sellers are sketchy. Buyer beware."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the product arrived with a fairly damaged casing and the screen was somewhat loose and not secured. after around a week of average use the touch controls stopped functioning and later the screen broke completely."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen freezes especially with some apps. But it doesn’t happen a lot. Everything else is great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just as described from seller came brand new just wish they also included an original charging cord and box my daughter loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is fine it works normal but it charges so so slow, I left it all night and it charged maybe to 70% I’m gonna try to fix this but if not then I will be returning it. It also didn’t come with an actual apple charger so I’ll be buying a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s bad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came defective in certain parts of the screen - it didn't feel the touch. I could not even enter my Apple ID because it didn't catch certain letters from the keyboard, especially the ""o"".For that reason, I couldn't pass the factory settings to check the cell phone in other aspects such as the camera, the battery, or the speakers.When I contacted the company, they told me they regret the problem (they only attend Monday to Friday - 9:00 am - 5:00 pm EST). After some e-mails, they asked me to take the cell phone to a repair shop to inquire about a QUOTE of a diagnosis and estimated repair cost.Finally, they told me that the only thing they could do was give me the refund and not the replacement of the product because ""they don't have it in stock""."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came super quick and the phone is just like it’s brand new. Definitely would recommend. Coming from Android I’m very impressed by this iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone! SO happy I took the plunge and bought the phone, it has been well worth it so far!-no scratches or dents anywhere-battery capacity 100%-unlocked & everything as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The touch part of the iPhone has been the worst I have seen!! I can’t text without having to shut my phone off and turn back on! I reset the settings and same thing! I won’t ever buy from here again!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone, seller ships through fed x which is much appreciated and my package was received early as well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I gave this a 5/5 because the phone came in perfect shape not even a scratch on it the battery has 100% of it life and came delivered nicely."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone speaker barely works, might as well not be there. Battery life degraded so fast. Loud speaker has one side working. Finger and face recognition inconsistent"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone worked for one day now my SIM card doesn’t work in it I can’t call it text and the charger came with a short in it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really needed a new phone and this was great! It was a lot cheaper then buying it anywhere else. I came in perfect condition and worked like it was brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the phone late and that's just one thing wrong, you advertise the phone be red which it wasn't it came black with a crack on the screen and when i went to get it activated it couldn't be because the many bar codes it has wouldn't let it be activated i feel scammed and very upset tat my son could not get what he paid for i would like a FULL refund and a apology"
"Apple","iPhone 11","We received the phone today and it's locked! It's really disappointing because we need it asap and now can't use it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My son like it, so far so good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A gift for my husband. He loves it. Looks like new. Works very well so far."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was in great condition and seller is awsome wasn’t suppose to get here until after Xmas but it it arrived early thank you so much"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Clean phone in great condition and virtually had a full battery on arrival. Nothing bad to say about seller or iPhone 11 besides metro to like 4hrs to reset the network on their end..... lmao"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Cut off in the middle of use. Refund time too long should not have to wait 30 days to get my money back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","excellent product, the phone arrived in good condition battery in 99% without shock without wear. the bands released for my country Guatemala, full unlocked. The shipped charger is not the original one however it is not relevant."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Slight scratches on screen, 98% battery, cheaper than official price by a bit"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone had many scratches and didn't appear as described"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Absolutely love the phone like brand new, I wish the packaging came differently but overall great buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I thought these phones were checked and tested however the phone screen will glitch and type or delete different stuff than what was being typed. Camera and other apps will open or close on it's own. I'm assuming the phone had a screen replaced or something and was repaired wrong. Return process has been a big hassle and I'm about to call my bank to reverse charges. I checked Apple and I could have bought the exact same phone, brand new, for the exact same price. This seller should consider selling better phones and as these are referbs, sells for less than new. Will never buy a referb phone from Amazon again and am questioning Amazon all together as they couldn't help in the return process either."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular no estaba probado ya que no funcionaba la camara Truedepth y cuando lo quisimos configurar también se trababA"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Showed up on time, undamaged, like new, pretty, sunny yellow color,"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything seemed like it was in order with my iphone 11. It even started up well. However, throughout the first day, the phone would randomly restart itself. Nothing seemed to change with each restart but I couldn't figure out if I was doing something or not so I had to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s perfect I love it I had it for 3 months I haven’t had any issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like how even though this phone is refurbished it works as if it’s brand new, which is great!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone Life battery is low..I charged it to 100% haven't used it that much and in less than an hour it's was 89%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone. Does everything it should. One odd thing is, it takes a lot longer to fully charge than any other phone I remember."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was a little scared to buy a phone off line and was really excited when it came in the mail earlier than expected. But sad to say that the left side of the touch screen doesn’t work most of the time and will have to return. Very disappointed in my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in almost perfect condition. Slightly scuffed on the rim of the camera, but the glass on the camera and screen were immaculate. Very happy with my purchase."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Cargador original"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tiene algún defecto de pantalla. A veces muestra el texto ( teclado) y otras veces no. Y hay que apagar Para que vuelva hacer esa función. Pero le ocurre muy seguido"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Could barely hear during phone calls. Called Apple support and they confirmed it was the phone itself. Seller wouldn't send a replacement without first sending this phone back (meaning I would be without a phone indefinitely, not an option)."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was my first time buying a phone online. I upgraded from the iphone 7. This product came exactly as advertised and works really well. I was a little skeptical buying it but it works great and i have no problems. The shipping was quick too."

"Apple","iPhone 11","When I received this refurbished iPhone 11, the first thing I noticed were scratches on the back and scuffs on the sides of the phone. I didn't expect the phone to be perfect but I had hoped the previous owner would have used a case. Returned to buy it new from Apple for $499."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It alright it freezes from time to time and cut you in and out of calls"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am not sure how the phone can be fully tested. The down volume is clearly not working. After we spent all the setting up, now we are figuring out how to return it. Physical mechanics have to be properly tested. Very disappointed"

The screen was had been removed and not properly reinstalled. Screws were missing and it was not properly sealed. We wound up having to replace the screen and screws."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thought I'd get a new iphone camera before a trip. Wasted so much time trying to fix problems. Makes you wonder if Synergy checks out their phones at all. And doesn't inspire confidence for refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It look just like the picture. it’s really good"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Product went totally defective in less than one year. I would have been better off buying a brand new iPhone from Apple with AppleCare because I would have gotten a better product, better customer support and better warranty. I would have saved money if I didn't buy this knock off phoney phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is just like new, just got it today and I haven’t seen any problems so far . However my shipment was delayed several times before I received it but I’m guessing it’s due to the pandemic."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I had little scratches but it was cool"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Right off the bat I knew something wasn’t right, the speakers weren’t loud, camera wasn’t up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I “update it” even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it’s not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and don’t see how this is not illegal in some form of way."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received a 64G phone with flash and overheating issues, although I paid for a 128G phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Daughter love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Every thing is good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Overall i would be inclined to give this item a higher rating as the phone itself was in great condition, however upon arrival the phones microphone did not work at all...a message was sent to seller with no response at all, only an approval for a refund...item was returned immediately and waiting on refund...I would have just asked for an exchange (less hassle) however due to sellers silence I will just get a refund and shop somewhere else I guess..."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone looks like new , working good so far !!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen, if it was replaced before, was not properly replaced or the wrong screen was placed on the phone I ordered. The screen delays to some of my touches or it doesn’t react at all. I was honestly better off spending my money on something else. I bought this expecting to get more for my money, but I ended up spending more for less."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can’t complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iphone 11 works good the only thing I didn’t like is that I purchased a really expensive phone that came with scratches on screen and it seems like they put a screen to cover the In perfections on the actual phone screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono está bien lo que no me gusto es que llego rallado pelado pero funciona bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","excelente estado .batería 95% , buen precio excelente como regalo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was aware I was buying a used phone. There was the assumption I was being sent a phone in good working order - otherwise what is the point of the ""renewed""? The phone I was sent is self reporting battery replacement is needed.Was the phone never even turned on over there - yet sold as renewed?You are welcome to issue me a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It didn’t turn on."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My Daughter is literally in love with this phone! It's in perfect condition, brand new if you ask me!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Compre este iPhone para mi hija ya hace meses y asta ahorita a funcionado de maravilla lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone is intact without any cosmetic details. Unlocked for all carriers in Venezuela."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought a refurbished iphone. The lcd screen had horizontal lines on the day I got it. It shows up intermittently. Not a deal breaker as I need a phone and wouldn't go through the hassle of returning it. But given I paid near 500 dollars for it, it is a disappointment."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Reconocimiento facial y muy buena vida de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Seemed brand new. Already had a screen protector installed perfectly. No scratches/blemishes. Unlocked. Quite a good deal, I’m happy with it"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the I phone 11, was amazing to figure out all the ways to use it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It still drops call in middle so . Not 100% reliable"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this iPhone in October 2019 and the speaker is already giving issues. Even if something was wrong with the phone before and it was fixed it shouldn’t have started giving problems so quickly. The return date has already passed so there’s nothing I can do or I would just send it back but I spent a lot of money on the item so I need something to be done please."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came 1 day early and amazing product overall"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me agrado el porcentaje de vida útil de batería, pero fuera de eso todo correcto y perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was my daughter it seem to be fine she doesn't put it down"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Even though it's a refurbished phone, I couldn't tell the difference!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It hold a great battery phone last me up to 3 in the afternoon"

"Apple","iPhone 11","So far look like a great deal!Everting is good cheap, no marks anywhere.Only bad thing I have to say, is, the charger is not Apple original."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was supposed to be ""renewed"" but when it arrived the speaker didn't work. It also arrived packaged in bubble wrap, without any documentation, instructions, or original Apple packaging. Had to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came with broken glass on part of the camera, rendering it unusable for photos requiring zoom. The phone was otherwise fine, but this is very disappointing, and I now I have to return it and repeat the setup process with another phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received this item today. I didn't receive retail packaging and I received an off brand charging brick and cord, I great but I could live with it. Went through all the trouble of activating the phone on my service to find out this phone gets 🔥 hot. I was making my mimoji and the phone started to heat up.

"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect condition bought my last iPhone from the same company no issues!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.Update: took both phones to apple and they’re both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was “re-sold” to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return 😑"

"Apple","iPhone 11","There are a lot of scraches on the phone case, and small scraches on the screen, actually a lot, but screen is generally fine.(Only part I'm satisfied is screen)I dont care about scraches, but battery life is abslutely unacceptable.You only give me 1% battery life with 19% already lost to have to change to another battery?if 85%, 87% is worst situation but I can accept, but 81%, seriously?Since it's a gift I gave to a friend in Spain, I'm not gonna return it,but it's very disappointing the battery life, and the case also exaggeratingly scrached."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent shape, looks brand new and battery health is at 100%. Came perfectly padded with charging cord and wall charger. This was a great buy, doesn’t seem “renewed” at all, appears new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The speaker doesn't work and when we put the screen protector on the screen it cracked. DO NOT BUY from this vendor."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I chose this seller because of 100% positive feedback but my phone is not compatible with the carrier it was sold as being exclusively for. When I tried to activate the phone I found out it is incompatible with my AT&T SIM card. I spent 2 hours on chat with support but they were just talking in circles and I was never convinced they even understood the problem. If someone pays almost $500 for an item, it should be as described. Further, there was extensive cosmetic damage. I honestly would've overlooked the damage if the phone had actually worked."
"Apple","iPhone 11","SIM was locked from previous carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Teléfono en perfectas condiciones batería 100 % vida estética impecable muy contento con la compra"

"Apple","iPhone 11","very good phone came 3 days earlier looks like new to me"
"Apple","iPhone 11","De aspecto se ve bien. Pero es un producto que por su estado no debería venderse en Amazon, ya que no cumple con la mínima calidad requerida. Lamentablemente estaba de paso por USA y no tenia tiempo de reemplazarlo. No lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","PRODUCT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND WAS SHIPPED IN A TIMELY MANNER"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not buy from this seller. I tried to set up the iPhone only to be informed that it was stolen and AT&T couldn’t do anything to help me. I’m incredibly frustrated."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It did not accept the sim card from my previous iPhone for some reason. Disappointed beyond words. Took it to ATT who informed me the phone is locked. Wondering if I can trust Amazon further on this…."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I started having problems with this phone about a week ago with the fingerprint reader and when someone calls me the button won’t slide over so I can answer the phone. The touch pad has been messing up as well. I haven’t even had this phone a good two months. I don’t have any water damage or an other damage so not sure why it is acting up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Absolutely wonderful product. Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. Looks and performs as brand new. Fantastic. The product arrived one day earlier than promised."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I was quite skeptical about buying an iPhone from here but when mine came in the mail those suspicions left. Mine came basically new with only a few tiny scratches. 100% battery life and everything worked perfectly! Totally worth it tbh"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone for my son's birthday and some suddenly calls he made and received would have no sound. It may work after alot of trouble shooting but it doesn't last. In addition the trouble shooting use to solve the problem doesn't work when it happens again. He is so disappointed. Obviously this phone was not checked for issues because this started a day after we got it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone screen was scratched after removing the screen protector"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Looks brand new. Arrived way sooner than expected. Would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not waste your time or money. These phones do not come unlocked, and therefore you CANNOT use them. They look great but they are locked by the previous owners carrier. You cannot unlock these phones. Just spent two hours on the phone with sprint and T-mobile to learn that lesson. Do not buy these refurbished phones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When the phone came in, it was like a new iPhone 11 instead of a renewal iPhone 11. Best decision I ever made"
"Apple","iPhone 11","As I tried to set up this phone, I found that certain letters on the keyboard were impossible to type. The screen just doesn't respond to touch in certain spots. I was unable to set up the phone, much less use it, because you have to enter your password and I couldn't type it. I will update this review once the seller responds to my complaint, but I am very frustrated that the phone was dysfunctional. Tech Exchangee's ""customer service"" number sends you to a random voicemail box."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Totally reliable and gets better signal reception than any Android I have used. Last Phone I will ever need!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love this phone"

 I am frustrated. I bought one white iPhone here last week, and the health battery was 76%. I asked a return because I wanted a iPhone with 80% minimum, as the description says. I tried again, buying a black one, But when it arrived the battery didn’t work. I tried 3 different chargers but the battery kept 1% all the time. I received the refund, but I had 2 bad experiences!!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Honestly when it came in I was very happy but unfortunately some letter didn’t work on the keyboard and I pressed on the letter and wouldn’t go through so honestly I paid 700$ and the phone looked very good but the screen wasn’t good. I’m sorry but sorry but I know you can do better next time. But I still recommend getting it because most phones do come in at its best."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love the phone however you will need a new SIM card for Boost Mobile service. Besides that everything works fine and looks absolutely amazing! Definitely will recommend!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11. This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This product is perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works perfect for what I need it to do."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's for my daughter and she loves it"

"Apple","iPhone 11","phone came with screen protector on it, not in a apple box but came in perfect condition and 100% battery life capacity.

could not be happier with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am dissapointed.. i had 2 unlocked iphone 11 (excellent condition) purchased from here but both had major issues. First which i already replaced had touchscreen issue and now my second white iphone 11 has network issue which i purchased for my sister as gift. Reason i am really upset is because it took away smile from her face as soon as we found phone was defective after several tries it still didnt show network..
I guess i have to replace second phone as well but it wont be same as the occasion is already passed.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone. It takes a little to get used too if switching from a button to no button. It has great battery life and great face recognition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is a great product!! The phone came in a good reliable box and was here a day before it was supposed to be. I would recommend this seller 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone feels like a new one, not a single scratch.
The battery is on its 100% and I’m so happy about it :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received the device today and it never turned on."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Personal Use"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente, esta como nuevo sin detalles, una de mis mejores compras en Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love this iPhone, it’s in impeccable shape & it works fantastic! I recommend this iPhone 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Mine came unlocked worked for my carrier, perfect condition, I got my phone in 2 days after ordering it. I love my phone.❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Microphone doesn’t work, when I call someone I can hear them but they can’t hear me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone doesn’t work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I’d paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.

Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works well

Cons: It’s not really unlocked – or its some weird hardware configuration. It won’t connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn’t work on sprint. I contacted the seller’s support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.

If I had it to do again, I’d spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Idk"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Before buying I specifically selected ""unlocked"" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I'll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a hassle and a half and you're most likely going to have to return it too."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No charger or charger cable included"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","got stuck in the set up, took 27 hours to update, it got stuck again. replacement is gonna take about a week to get here but i need it asap. that’s why i ordered it as 2 day shipping. my phone is currently almsot broken and i’m very distressed. not happy wtf?"

"Apple","iPhone 11","It was in perfect condition and is an amazing phone! Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I turned the phone on, it began powering off and on several times, so I knew something was wrong. Would not stay connected to my wi-fi, tried to update it and the screen went black and stayed black. I took it to a repair shop and it couldn't be fixed. Just sent it back. I've bought my last two refurbished phones on Amazon and never had a problem. Not sure about these ""renewed"" phones. My son bought one a few months ago and his was fine. So buyer beware it's a gamble."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great service"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Upon receiving this iPhone 11 I found it had a screen glitch where the top of the screen would not register my finger's touch. After my warranty ran out this phone developed a battery problem and now it dies at any percentage (including 98%!!!) and has even died twice while charging. This was my first experience with Amazon's ""Renewed"" phones and I won't be buying that again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My daughter loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works/functions well.
Battery life is good.
I have no problems or complaints.

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product at a great price. Would buy again👍👍👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Has few glitches. My iPhone screen zooms in by itself all the time. I put a screen protected and case on it from the day I bought it. It fell from my lap on to the floor and stopped working of 12 hours. Then it just magically started working again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","this phone stopped working after a month"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is in perfect condition, i love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received this phone on April 25 and we tried to activate the phone but we couldn't. I couldn't transfer my Data from my old phone and it came with scratch on it on the right top corner. Horrible. I returned since Saturday April 30th and waiting for my money back. I didn't hear from the seller yet. No recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Isn’t worth the price, I want it to attach some pictures but it didn’t let me do it !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It says ""like new"" but the phone that came was heavily used, covered in scratches and could not ever pass as like new. The packaging was also covered in fingerprints and just looked really dirty. I was buying it as a birthday gift for someone but could never give this to them. I wouldn't use it myself either this is not at all worth the amount paid. I will have to return it now and will not be able to give them a birthday gift. Very upset"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Couldn’t ask for a better buy. Phone is perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Veeeeery satisfied !!!"

I was only able to use the phone on speaker phone for a while so people could hear me. I have had a lot of issues with the speaker and this week the screen started to flash with lines across the phone. I contacted the seller this was a faulty product. It has 0 water damage, hasn't been dropped and has an otter box case. They said it is out of the warranty time period and can do nothing for me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product was in almost perfect condition. I just popped my Straight Talk SIM card In and immediately the phone was activated very satisfied"

Very annoying issues. Decided to get a replacement and the shipment has been delayed 3x now. Will be sending this one back and be out of a phone for at least a week. Will report back when I get the replacement. My family has bought refurbished phones multiple times with no issue, but I had to write an honest review so far."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return. I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated. They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","When peeling the phone film off, there were shards of glass coming from somewhere on the phone. There was also an almost intentional cursive H dead smack in the middle of the screen. No iphone certified accessories were included, only 3rd party.

The screen also sits above the phone and my service provider stated that this was not right, it should be flush like the phones he showed me. Returned, very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone would reset on and off on its own, after about two weeks of me getting sick of this, i returned it, only for them to tell me they received the item damaged and are refusing a full refund..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","impecable"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very satisfied with the long battery life and its face recognition is fun.."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I take care of all my phones/electronics and never bust them or scratch them but for some reason I already have a big scratch on the screen after only a couple of weeks, I’m assuming this phone just got a cheap screen replacement and then they shipped it out because there is also a bunch of extra black gunk around where the screen meets the body. Not great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone. Works great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The lenses on this phone were damaged and all images have a big black spot on them.

"Apple","iPhone 11","Seriously, pay a little more and buy new. The phone did not operate as expected. The phone would drop calls and once pictures were taken you couldn't get them off the phone using a USB cable. The phone would display an error every time you connected using a USB cable. This was tried using multiple computers and each time it would start the transfer and then error out. We are now having issues getting a refund. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a refund."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen teléfono"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn’t that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it’s kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn’t have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you’d be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don’t waste your money"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received phone. It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines. Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller. Could not clear the phone as the screen didn’t work. Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions. Sent phone back to seller. They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee! Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund. Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Thank you great quality!"

After using it 10-15 minutes the phone gets hot

"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone less than a year ago and it mysteriously stopped working for no reason! Even the Verizon guy was perplexed. If you just want a phone for a short time, go for it, otherwise look elsewhere."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I brought three(3) of the phone for my family and they work okay for a month. After that month of use it become disaster because they all came down with a battery problem. The phone would literally shut down while I'm on important calls, it was extremely hot🔥 and the battery wasn't holding the charge. I personally replaced the battery with the original batteries and same thing occur. The reason I couldn't return was because I was out of the country and wouldn't be able to return in time."

I called our telephone provider and technician indicated that this phone is not allowing our SIM card to activate. I do not think this phone is fully unlock to use it.

"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone for the main reason it was unlocked but it turns out it isn’t it’s just another company phone I cannot use other sim cards with"
"Apple","iPhone 11","For the most part everything is okay
Different parts of the screen won’t work during certain times
So I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work after
While writing this review I can’t even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrect
When I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work after
That worked for less than a day and I don’t want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollars
Can’t even use numerical characters

Update I reached out to them again saying their advice didn’t work and haven’t received a response and it’s been a week"

"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is terrible.
Have to send a text 4 times to get it to send. Then sometimes it still won't go through. Keeps saying update- EVEN AFTER IT UPDATES. Constant WIFI error. Won't ring/ and when it does....you might miss your call because you're unable to answer it. SO DISAPPOINTED - Because I bought this phone, to give as a birthday gift. Will try the updates and trouble shooting one more time, before returning it. I so regret this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","IPhone is in excellent physical/visual condition. However, if I pay the price that is sooo close to the Apple cost then why do I have all these problems?!! Even if the purchase is a ""risk"" (because it's renewed/refurbished) Why take so long to respond to help resolve issues?!!! This is frustrating!!! I've contacted my carrier and the phone is indeed unlocked but something on the inside is not working properly. But can't get this resolved in a reasonable amount of time because this company doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time!!!!!!!!!"

I don’t even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it’s honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that’s what they said ab the technician ) but I’m just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):"

"Apple","iPhone 11","After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge. Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced. WTH! Ordered and received early October 2020. Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead. And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days. Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window. BS!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m so disappointed with my purchase. Sadly I couldn’t make the complaint or change vaciase I’m already in my country, I was in the US for a short period. The phone has two scratches on th screen. Completely disappointed."

"Apple","iPhone 11","My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Plus the BUY BACK Program is a scam. They try to low ball you, AFTER saying the expected amount they'll give you AFTER you've already sent it in. Then if you don't accept you get it back weeks later. Plus I sent it in with a brand new ""Real Apple Charge Cable & Charger"" and they KEPT the cable and charger, only returned the phone. The phone I traded in, was in better screen shape than the screen on the phone I purchased. Will NEVER do this again."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone's touch screen completely non-functional out of the box. There were no cracks but since the device didn't register any touch, I was never able to get past the initial setup screen (even after restarts). In their defense, they did offer a refund though unfortunately I was too busy to send it in time. I'm not saying all of their phones come broken but I figure it's worth mentioning that mine was."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone’s battery health came at 80%. The phone also did not come with a working charger. I would not recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything is Very smooth."

The time and date were never correct on my phone, the notifications didn’t work, the sound was crackly so any time i would listen to music or anything it would crackle. speaker phone didn’t work, the front flash was completely foggy there were dents and chips in the phone itself when it arrived. I tried various methods to fix these things and i contacted the seller and all they said was to return the phone. they did not say they’d exchange it or they’d fix my phone and we’re not helpful at all. i returned the phone and just bought one from apple it was only 30$ more."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Very nice It’s not a scam"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My own personal use. I received my phone in great condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with screen seriously scratched. It says that they have minor blemishes that are ""not visible when held at arms length."" But that is BS as this phone had pretty serious scratches on the screen. Other blemishes would be fine, but not on the screen. Will be sending back for a replacement, since they already have my money and I know it will be a pain to get a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No scratches on my phone delivery was fast came packaged properly no complaints so far"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Sprint customers transitioning to T-Mobile with the merger. We purchased two iPhone 11s from this vendor. One phone activated just fine. Had problems activating the second phone. Spent 1 hr 40 min at the T-Mobile store. Second phone IMEI was reported 'Lost' by the previous owner. Easy return process and received our refund. Ordering another phone. Hopefully won't run into the IMEI issue again."

"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone looks and works like a new phone. Extremely happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came severely scratched. Not thrilled for $400"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","In fact, this phone is a used phone that has not been renewed at all. There are fine scratches, and there are fatal scratches on the screen. This is completely different from what I expected. I will never recommend this store to people."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 is an excellent phone. However, the one I purchased crashed and the Bluetooth and Wifi failed. I contacted the company and they refunded my money without a whole lot of hassle."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Value for money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was in very good condition but it is garbage it is garbage it will not sync with any of my Apple products I tried to buy AppleCare and I put in the number the serial number the The serial number and he wouldn’t even register at Apple so that makes me 🤔 Bootleg phones they’re not real Apple phones if they won’t register at Apple then what are they bootleg I have reached out to them and they refused to reach back so I guess this get their intention😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Don’t buy"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phones condition was disappointing, the earpiece volume is too low I have to put the phone on loudspeaker, visible signs of screen replacement it generally doesn’t feel like a new phone to me."

Then, at the first update it shuts down & won't connect to charger, computer, anything! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone I received will not even turn on! Will not charge- nothing. Now I am out a phone for even longer- have to wait for them to send me a shipping slip before I can even start the refund process. I don't understand- do they not even quality check phones before sending? Very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is worth the money and I works really good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isn’t worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A gift"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great deal and works with sim any carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 11","PERFECT!! Like new!! Battery 100%. Adapter is generic."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user. So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","my daughter loves her new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The top right side of the screen is extremely scratched. It is apparent that even though the screen is very scratched, the screen has been replaced.

"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","2 days after receiving my device the phones camera went black. I bought apple insurance to get it fixed, now its doing something wonky with the keyboard. I might as well have bought it new from apple for the hassle. I decided to buy based on mixed reviews but most were positive, unfortunately it didnt work out for me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","A few scratches but relatively brand new with screen protector!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Paid 2/3 the retail price and love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Work good I like it nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wonderful"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Thickness"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had it 2 weeks so far so good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When arrived, battery life was already at 80%. My husband has had this same phone for two years and he’s still in the 90’s. After researching, I was able to get the same phone for very close to the same price at the Apple store near me and it was brand new. The refund process was fairly easy though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Every time they send a new phone. It doesn't work correctly. There is something always wrong with it. These are not refurbished phones. They are junk used ones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 This is a real iPhone so happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," This is a real iPhone so happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was super excited to receive product, however… the screen was super scratched. Phone was sooo dirty and had a lot of scuff marks on it. Then the battery only had a maximum capacity of 86% and you can buy a NEW iPhone 11 64GB from apple for the same price as this… don’t waste your money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Camera is totally messed up. I thought these were supposed to be verified to work properly? I am returning and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. Check everything when you receive your phone because this obviously was not checked very well. Camera makes a static noise and shakes. Totally unusable."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in before and so worth it to buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muchas gracias me gustó la cámara está de exelente👍😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had the phone for less than a month and it worked beautifully but then it wouldn't turn on anymore wouldn't work no matter how long I charged it or where I took it. So I requested a refund and sent it back and it has been over a month and still no refund. Be careful guys."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The main reason I was upgrading my phone was for the nicer camera. Unfortunately the camera wouldn't focus and made a loud clicking noise whenever the camera app was open. Returned, and hoping to have better luck next time"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Eveyething work but my speaker has been messed up since I got it idk why but the speaker sucks phone go in and out"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Teléfono en muy buen estado y perfecto funcionamiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months). Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version. Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one. I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous. Worst decision ever buying this one.
Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my new phone it’s great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was not unlocked…very unfair to me as a customer"

"Apple","iPhone 11","After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month! My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came perfectly with a amazing battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen turned white after 8 months! Tried rebooting... etc. nothing worked. Piece of junk! total wate of money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything on the outside of this phone was just okay until I switched it ON and used it for a couple hours. This cellphone couldn't stay ON for longer than 30 minutes and kept restarting/booting itself repeatedly. The operating system was stuck on the oldest version and refused to accept any updates. Complete LEMON! Avoid this seller at all costs!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I get it. I picked the wrong model. But nowhere in this product description does it say that there is a 15% restocking fee."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It works straight out of the box"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good condition guys"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I always use my AirPods when I use the phone but today for the 1st I didn’t and the could NOT hear anything from the other person at all! The literally had to use a different phone to make my call because I tried several times and the speaker is broke!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfectly functional brand new unlocked iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered GSM unlock and it wasn’t"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Right off the bat you can see the phone was visibly dirty and the speakers were filled with dirt. When I tested out the speakers the left side didn’t work at all and the right side sounded off pitch"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So my phone has been working great since I bought it in May 2020. I take great care of it. I have a case on it. It hasn’t gotten wet or anything. I did the new update recently and it was fine at first but the cellular isn’t working. Apple said it was a hardware issue."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great as expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome phone. Great price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","They make it seem like this will work like a brand new phone, but it seems like they just sell your someone’s old broken one wo fixing it. Dropped calls, no internet, can’t hear, alllll the things. After shelling out $600 I did not expect that from my phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It even came with a fast charger, great conditions, loving it"

"Apple","iPhone 11","It was locked couldn't use I wasted my money"
"Apple","iPhone 11","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 and it never connected to cell service correctly until eventually it stopped working altogether. I got a new SIM card and still nothing. Went to apple store and they ran diagnostics on it and found that the phone was faulty. Had to spend $500 to replace the phone. This seller is fraudulent. Do not trust that they will sell you a working product. Buyer beware"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Didn’t come with a lot"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No vale la pena esta muy maltratado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came without a scratch. Easy to set up. Everything works."

But since getting it hooked up and working yesterday (the same day I received it) the earpiece is scratchy and distorted to the point that you cant hear the person's words when they talk.

"Apple","iPhone 11","Straight out of the box, the phone did not work. The seller told me I just needed to updated the phone. Jumped through hoops trying to update and reset the phone with no success. According to Apple, the phone was over 1500 days out of warranty. Not sure how that is possible since the iPhone 11 was released less than 2 years ago. Do not buy from this seller. It's a scam!!"

It gets hot and turns off completely during calls or texting and also when I’m not even using it I can see it turn on and off. Setup the facial recognition but since it turns off so much it always needs the manual code. Definitely requesting a return."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente teléfono, vida útil de la batería 100%. 100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ordered this phone because it said it worked for TMOBILE. It doesn't work with TMobile and it isn't unlocked. It is carrier locked to a different company and cannot be unlocked through TMobile. According to TMOBILE it can only be unlocked through the original carrier and they don't know who that is. Big waste of time and money! I've asked for a refund but this is just more days of waiting to be able to buy a phone. Writing this review so others can be cautious."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect replacement!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just messaged the seller, and hoping to hear from them soon.The phone came super quick, which is amazing. I was able to figure out how to transfer my info super fast and I was happy to be saving money and causing less damage to the planet. However, the camera must be damaged as it takes pictures with a dark spot in the picture. And now the keyboard is lagging. I hope they are able to work with me to either send me another one or fix this one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face ID doesn’t work."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Had to immediately have battery replaced and now have to go get whole thing fixed as it keeps just shutting off. Amazon is reimbursing for charges to get it fixed, but what a pain! I use my phone for work and this has been a big hassle. Very disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product exceeded my expectations"
"Apple","iPhone 11","#love it 📱"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not waste your money on this phone. It says internationally unlocked but it's crap. It is not reliable. One minute it works the next minute no service. The phone came with the screen chipped around the edge and it has been downstream since. The sellers are terrible."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 I uploaded a screen recording of how the video and camera jump around. If I use other apps it doesn’t do that - buying a refurb phone was a bad idea. Not a happy customer."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen is severely scratched up… I am keeping this but will never buy from Amazon again concerning iPhones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","very bad conditions"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someone’s pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Worked for a few weeks perfectly then after that I would use it for a little and the phone would get really hot and also the battery would decrease insanely fast"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The speakers were blown out."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone .."
"Apple","iPhone 11","After many hours on the phone with my service provider, it was finally decided that the phone just wasn't unlocked and unusable. Sent the refurbished phone back and went to the Apple store to buy a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","perfect phone came with headphones & a good charger"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen problems since day one try to get a replacement but no answer finally get a partial refund lost about 50% of value, they install a cheap screen n sell to smeoneelse"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone so far seems to run OK but for $500 I expect it not to be extremely scratched and just tore up I can understand as a refurbished phone a few scratches here and there but this one just came extremely extremely scratched and tore up"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product arrived damaged with multiple visible scratches on the touch screen."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It will not charge , the charge charges backwards . And it will die in maybe a 20 min span"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Defective phone, needed a motherboard. This phone was absolute garbage. I sent it to Ghana, Africa to a cousin so there’s no way I can return it for full refund. I got screwed on this deal big-time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone took forever to even arrive and when it did part of the screen did not work and certain keyboard buttons also would not work. Very frustrating to spend this much money on a phone for it to be defective"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pantalla no original salta mensaje de que el repuesto no es original y se reinicia cada 3 minutos, luego de restaurarlo por itunes no prendio mas. Es la cuarta vez que me pasan cosas extrañas con telefonos usados"
"Apple","iPhone 11","A few scuffs on the edges but other than that annoyingly so, I’m enjoying the phone overall."
"Apple","iPhone 11","it seemed like new the thing I didn’t like is was it wasn’t in its original boxing didn’t even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it’s refurbished and the seller won’t help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I’m mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don’t buy this product as it’s just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won’t even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","great!! It is a nice phone!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","COMPLETELY SCRATCHED. They put a screen protector on it so I don’t notice the amount of scratches on the phone. DO NOT RECOMMEND. IT’S DEFINITELY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY."
"Apple","iPhone 11","display defect on black screen as shown in the photos also phone powered off initially when I launced the camera, tried using camera after reboot it worked and then shuts off tring to switch from the face cam to the rear cam I need my money back"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The cell price was too high comparing to all damage on the phone frame and camera ring. Next time make this failure visible and sell for a fair price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just opened the generic box a few hours ago and wasnthappy at all......no earbubs, generic charging cord and ablack generic brick.the kicker is how the paint has been eaten awayon the top of the phone......(like how???!!!!!!)I should have just went to apple refurb.Never again!!!!!soooooo not worth the money.......this sucks!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought jt hoping jt was a iPhone but to my surprise it was not a iPhone as it says it does not say iPhone on the back where it should it says product"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exilant"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone! Must buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Apparently, they are supposed to test the devices, and yet I was still sent one with an unresponsive screen. How does something that glaring of a defect make it past initial testing? Waste of time and money. I'll be sure to not buy from this reseller again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I know it was a renewed phone but for the money you still expect a decent phone. This one was full with small scratches on the back and even two bigger ones in the front…I sent it back immediately…"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I've only had the phone for 6 months and the mother board went out"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best. Here's to hoping that their returns process works better than the eyesight of whoever ""certifies"" their phones..."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I never got it so I can give and Opinion on this phone but I have iPhones before and I love them"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No lo recomiendo"

Per phone store will cost over $200 to replace. Not happy with this. Attempting to contact seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My Face ID didn’t work. My front portrait mode doesn’t work They offered to replace but I would have had to send the whole phone back in order to replace which would’ve left me with no phone until they decided rather on rather not they would fix/replace it . So sad such a bummer not having Face ID"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had to repair the display speaker on the phone this costed me additional $245. I was left with no choice because I was without a phone. NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS."

"Apple","iPhone 11","It came with a cracked bottom lens. That wasn’t mentioned in the product description. I think it should have been cheaper if it was gonna come with a damaged camera. I would like a refund to cover the cost to fix the lens at least. | update I had to return the phone. It kept turning off."

"Apple","iPhone 11","First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPs one was advertised as fully unlocked, i.e. could be used on any network. When it arrived it was discovered to be locked to the AT&T network, which we do not have in South Africa. The iPhone was thus useless for me."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s ashamed this was mid marked as an unlocked phone. My teenager saved to buy an iPhone and then we ended up buying at apple store for about $40 less"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not purchase!!! I bought as a Christmas gift and my daughter has had nothing but issues with the camera. Unfortunately, we are unable to return because of how long it has been since purchased. I will never again by a ""renewed"" phone again. Now I have to spend even more money replace my daughter's phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I unboxed the iPhone the touch screen didn’t work. I drained the battery and charged it up and that got the touch screen working.
When I tried to use my newly purchased SIM card from Straight Talk it did not work!
The iPhone Is locked and will not except the SIM card!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone was not working. I had to take it to the apple store to have it repaired at the cost of $200.00 dollars. I paid over $700.00 for this phone. The total cost of a new phone. Bad use phone, not worth the cost."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awesome."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Did not like this at all. Screen had a scratch that is more like a crack through. So that's like the screen is broken. Not happy at all."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone is defective and I’ve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone won’t stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I don’t like leaving bad reviews but I’m extremely frustrated and this hasn’t been resolved."

"Apple","iPhone 11","iPhone 11 came with a screen protector on it but had multiple gashes in the screen which the screen protector was trying to cover up. I tried emailing BuySpry and they still haven't responded and they're making me pay for return shipping. Do not use them if you can avoid it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Wow... Went to activate phone and Verizon says the phone has been reported as STOLEN?!?!? The girl at tech support was very nice and issued me a refund. She stated that the phone may not have been wiped clean by the previous owner, but either way, aren’t they supposed to check these things out before simply sending them out to buyers? Wow, I’d expect this on eBay, but not Amazon. ☹️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Battery healthiness is 77%"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone shuts off randomly all the time and in order to get a replacement we have to send the phone in so my husband will be without a phone for up to two weeks as I’m 39 weeks pregnant. This company is a joke. They can’t promise that you are going to get a good working phone. I would just spend the extra money and get a different one. Not worth 700 bucks."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone calls no one can hear you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its a nice phone but it came damage half the phone screen didnt work at all couldn't tap on any apps or text. I dont know if whoever shipped damage it or it was just bad phone but im not happy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego pronto.en buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought two units. One was ok and the other with the selfie camera in green. I was expecting both units in good conditions. Very dissappointed."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Screen has visible scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked . When I searched for iphone 11a I put Boost mobile only to find out this phone isn’t compatible to boost mobile and I’m really upset and pissed because I spent almost $800 on this phone plus shipping and handling only to find out the phone isn’t even compatible with Boost. I will be getting a refund , credit or something"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone was advertised as a renewed i-Phone 11, T-Mobile. It is in great condition, but was locked and not compatible with T-Mobile. Very disappointed in the false advertising."
"Apple","iPhone 11","AT&T turned off my service because phone reported stolen. Now wife had to go back to her old phone. I have to go to buy new phone now. Can’t believe Amazon sell stolen property."
"Apple","iPhone 11","after a couple days the touch screen started being very unresponsive. Impossible to type on and different apps opening when I was clearly trying to open another one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Older than I was inspecting"
"Apple","iPhone 11","If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I wouldnt pay more than $100 for this thing. They've obviously done a terrible job fixing whatever issue this phone had in the refurbishing process. The thing is so slow it crashes when scrolling through simple apps like Twitter or Instagram. Need to back up your photos? Forget it, impossible on this thing. Quite literally unusable for anything but calls. Absolute waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It didn't work out of the box. The number 8 wouldn't work and the downloading of software from the old phone had to be restarted 3 times. Returned it. Bought a 10 refurbished from iPhone. The return was easy so they do stand behind their product and the refund was prompt."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the phone refurbished and upon receipt I took it to tmobile to start service and the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen by the owner. I couldn't believe it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Artículo como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My iPhone 11 stopped working just after the 90 day “replacement/repair” window ended. For $700 I expect my phone to work longer than 90 days, if you feel the same I SUGGEST YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE! PS- I did contact the seller and ask for help to which they offered NONE."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Like new"
"Apple","iPhone 11","When you buy a refurbished phone, you expect it to be fully refurbished—including a functioning battery that charges fully. I tried to trust Amazon renewed, but received a disappointment. My iPhone 7 it replaced has better battery life!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I recommend to anyone who is going to invest their money in this not to buy it, they are not supposed to sell damaged things, buy one of these and it would turn on and off by itself, so it is useless to sell something damaged"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone never worked. You sold a dud. It was a terrible experience and hassle and very disappointed especially with how expensive it was. I had to go to Apple store and buy brand new phone but I never want this bad experience again. Not worth my time or money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s was scratched when I got the phn"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in good condition except it wouldn’t make phone calls or text messages unless updated. The “update” wouldn’t allow the phone to update as well as not reading the SIM card. Upon further investigation it meant that the phone was unlocked but not the phone carrier. I returned it and I am still waiting on my refund."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When I received my iPhone 11 and started it up, it was stuck on the startup Apple logo for 20 minutes. I was finally able to log in when it crashed, over and over. I contacted Apple to troubleshoot it and they said there was a problem with the hardware. I don’t see a way to talk to anyone at this company so I’m returning it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was sold a phone from this company that didn’t have a functioning speaker or any sound at all. This made me late to work when I woke up to zero sound for my alarm. No sound for calls, music, ringer, anything. Double check if you order a phone from here before going about your day."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Alot of the functions in the phone are slow or do not work half the time. I'm returning for my money back. I'm sure they have other devices that work just fine and I just wasn't lucky with the one they sent."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was not fully unlocked like said"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came with a screen protector on it that had a scratch on it...or seemed to. Screen protector cracked so I removed it and there’s not only one huge gouge but another one and a scuff mark on the screen. Touch screen doesn’t always work the best either. As soon as I get a replacement, I will be sending it back :("
"Apple","iPhone 11","I received this device and half the screen does not work it is impossible to type on it and it goes crazy when you try to navigate the screen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in defected when the volume adjust itself. I put the volume up for incoming calls and it does whatever it wants sometimes it rings high other times it rings really low and other times it rings ones then turns silent. I’m so angry cuz it was used and payed full price and it doesn’t even work correctly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone broke 4 months after I ordered due to a “hardware” issue I’m pretty sure the phone broke from this before and had to be renewed and was never truly fixed this is a faulty phone and I would not order it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything about the phone was perfect except it kept shutting off, no matter how many times I reset the phone. I returned it and bought another from the same seller. No complaints with the new phone, looks brand new and there are no issues with the functionality. I would definitely buy again from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone did not work and started glitching immediately then froze. Was a bday present for my daughter. Thankfully Amazon let us return for full refund. Buyer beware!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pensé que el móvil iba a llegar con el 100% de batería y veo que no fue así, me siento decepcionada."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First of all, it is false advertisement! I received my phone today and the phone is not unlocked! The seller needs to stop playing w/ people's money and lying because we don't have it like that to be going back and forth with this. I advise you to just get a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not buy.There is a three month warranty which ended three days ago and now the phone stopped working.It didn't last!It's a dud!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono se apaga cada dos minutos prende y apaga solo, trate de contactar en vendedor pero nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the phone but almost at the 2 week point the volume had problems and couldn’t get a good response from the people said they didn’t recognize the IMEI number it was invalid?? So I’m looking at having to get it fixed after paying almost 700.00 for the phone. I’ll never purchase anything from them again so disappointed."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I can’t send messages to anyone who doesn’t have an iPhone. The power button doesn’t work correctly and often times Siri doesn’t respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. I’d never buy again or from this company."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one."

Also was never able to install I cloud."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The screen has severe scratched like cracked., is this normal to renewed phone? Too expensive for the 2 year old-used phone.. very disappointed"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not buy these phones . They are not from the United States and stop working after awhile. Because they are from somewhere else, Apple will not service them (mine was from China). Just go buy from the Apple store. It’s the same price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great but they failed to mention that it won’t work with all phone companies. Fully renewed and restored they should put which companies you can use as a plan and which ones you can’t but they don’t.VERY misleading product."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not an actual IPhone. When you turn it on it says “not supposed by Apple” !! I returned it and got another. I wouldn’t even chance it. Seems to be a fake Apple phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11","This was my first iphone (and most likely my last). There are a few good things about it; however, they aren't enough to warrant the price. There are a lot better phones, I feel like the budget phone I came from shot better photos and video. The camera on the iphone does poor in low light settings. It glitches out a lot and worst of all, it is super fragile. Even in an otterbox, this thing got super dinged up."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Carrier could not get it to connect to their network"

But the screen protector started lifting up on the edges one day into use so I just got new one. I took the screen protector off smoothly and made sure not to crack it or anything. After getting it off I realized it was hiding MANY flaws on the phone. Small cracks and scratches, even 2 shatter marks that look like someone stabbed the phone with a pencil. I’m very disappointed because I have to replace the screen or other screen protectors don’t work right on it.

There were so SIM card restrictions, and it wasn't a problem with my provider (SIM card worked on other phones), so it had something to do with the phone itself. I was told I should send it back and get a replacement since it had the 90-day backing guarantee from Amazon so that's what I tried to do. The sellers told me that I couldn't be sent a replacement because of stock or something, but I could send it back in for a refund. So I did just that about three days ago, and I'm still waiting for the money to be back into my account. In the mean time, I bought another one since I figured that it was probably just a one-time fluke. Thankfully, that turned out to be the case. My new ones SIM is working and I can do everything with my service. Granted, I just got it an hour ago so I don't know if there's any other kinks I haven't figured out yet, but so far so good. Will update my review if I don't get my refund money or something is wrong with the new phone.Update: Top speaker has been weird since I got it. I can’t call without putting it on loud speaker because it’s way too quiet regularly. Other than that, everything is fine."

"Apple","iPhone 11","This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.
Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.
Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.
Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.
I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.
The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth i"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery capacity was 91%) would be a little happier if it was more, but im still thankful it had that much. a few scratches on the buttons but that normal when you buy a refurbished iphone but overall the back was nice and glossy and the screen was in good condition i really love it the speakers were a decent sound no issues there and everything was working just like it was suppose too"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in great condition, battery life at 92%, no cracks on screen, nor scratches on the phone it self, Face ID works seamlessly and the camera doesn’t have any problem, at first I was skeptical about purchasing a renews phone but i do 100% recomend it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","90% battery life and really good conditions. Great purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","After just over 3 months of use and perfect care, the device will no longer power on. Hoping I can get an exchange or my money back.

Update: The device 90 warranty expired and the device died at day 121 and there is no way to recoup. Buyer beware."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have been using a hand me down Iphone 6s plus for years. It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!

Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.

Overall, this has been a great experience. I love the new phone and will update my review in 90 days."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Not a good quality after one month stop ringing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","software, camera etc work well on this phone. I like to use my phone for pictures while I'm hiking, skiing, out and about, to call & text while in the grocery store to check with housemates etc THIS PHONE IS TOO BIG TO FIT IN MY POCKETS! I thought I'd get used to it, but really its a hassle to deal with for someone who's on-the-go and wants a phone that's easy to stow and grab.

My previous iphone SE fit into the chest pocket on active jackets, the small-ish zipper pocket on multiple purses, this one does not."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought an iPhone from this seller the iPhone right from the had some minor issues that I thought was ok based on being refurbished. But one day the screen had a white line going from top to bottom and was within my 90 days. Well lets just say if you are looking to return your phone due to defect make sure you hold on to your seat because it is crazy hard to get anything done with this seller. They fix their phones with cheap parts that is the reason the phones don’t last. They try their best to scam you when you return your item trying to get almost 50% restocking fees, Good thing Amazon helped out and everything was solved but if not for Amazon you would be out of luck. If you buy from them make sure you understand and are ok with a cheap product. The phone was almost $600 dollars it was not cheap."

It’s literally JUST LIKE NEW!!! Don’t be scared I don’t know about the other people BUT MY PHONE came perfect !!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","phone is amazing looks and feels brandnew"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this iPhone for my child because mine broke and I started using hers so I got it and it came amazing ! I got the real package of apple and there’s no scratches so nothing to worry about! I recommend this iPhone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very happy with my purchase!!! Will recommend this company! 💕"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought mine from Metro, so my only choices were black or red, went with black though it sits in a case anyway. Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its battery life is pretty bad"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I had gotten the phone really early, it has no scratches or blemishes and the battery life is 90%. The box and charger wasn’t apple (but if you have your own before this shouldn’t be too bad) and it did have the phones information with it. It IS unlocked and came with a screen protector and sim card remover :) everything is nice and like new. I can’t say this is guaranteed to be for everyone but if you need something not super pricey this is the best seller, be aware not every phone can be perfect but if you want this buy it with some thought."

No visual damage and no issues as far as being locked or anything I’m very satisfied with this phone so far so good!! Definitely will be buying from them again. It came with a screen protector on it already so that’s was a plus also. I ordered my phone on Tuesday and received on Saturday so not to long of a wait.. I upgraded from a 7plus it was well needed!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","too long"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This purchase was an upgrade from and Iphone 6, love, love, love my new purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Do not like as much as my old 6s plus. No “Home” button makes it difficult to unlock. Face recognition another obstacle. Need to remove hat and glasses for it to work, which is understandable but you need to pass a bunch of failed attempts before you can type in your password. No wonder Verizon had a sale on this version.
Pros:
Camera is amazing.
Screen goes to the edge. I was worried going from the plus this would feel smaller.
Battery definitely lasts longer.
Apple tech support as always is the best of the best."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone 11 is the worst cell/smart phone I’ve ever had the displeasure of using since my parents bought me my first analog cell 20 years ago. TL;DR Worst phone you could ever buy; would love to chuck this junk upside the wall.When I bought the iPhone 11 at the store (Verizon), I told the lady my broken Samsung J3 previously had been driving me nuts with loading times for basic websites. She said “Yeah, you get the cheap phone, you get the slow speed.” Knowing price point had absolutely nothing to do with bandwidth, CPU, etc. I of course didn’t bother arguing with a person, and I simply bought the phone everyone buys — the newest iPhone model.Well, it’s the worst. My $150 Samsung J3 would load websites faster. Not even close. When this iPhone does load a website, it loads one or two images and often fails to load the rest. Photos or icons in emails? Forget about it: You’re not going to see em. Videos? I can get em to work on YouTube, due to Google’s investments in getting those videos to work flawlessly across all your devices. Otherwise, I’m looking at a spinning wheel going nowhere. Yeah. It won’t load websites like, a lot. This screen just sits there with the blue bar stuck 1/5th across.This phone frequently freezes in popular apps (like the Amazon app), and I have to reload the app (this is an easy process, albeit not a process at all with the $150 Samsung J3).Several nights I got “Your phone isn’t connected to the internet.” No internet. Great investment for me. Maybe this phone actually works if you have AT&T or something? I wouldn’t know. It’s next to useless for me, and I’m stuck with it. I would’ve bought a 5G phone if I lived in a 5G city, but that tech won’t be here for at least three years.If it weren’t par for the course these days, I’d truly be amazed by the worthless performance of the most marketed option.666 666 666 666 666 666UPDATE: My phone continues to lose internet connection. Can’t check my Garmin data in the mornings, or even randomly look something up throughout the day. So many times I reach for my phone here on top of the knoll just north of Pittsburgh, where I’ve had perfect cell/satellite service for 20 years, and my smart phone informs me “No internet connection.”This brand new phone’s iCloud was full in 3 months; 5 GB (nothing) is your new limit in the cloud, so with no gaming accounts and next to no videos, my phone is completely ‘full’ because unless I buy (yeah right, not happening) another worthless iPhone down the road or pay monthly for iCloud—a ‘service’ I’ve never benefited from along with everyone I know—I’m gonna lose all these photos just like every other time.Just to update and/or backup your phone, you have to have it plugged into the wall and hooked up to WiFi — insert the BS puking emoji right here. Do you have WiFi? I don’t, and my $150 Samsung phone didn’t care."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I went to the phone store to put my line to this phone and igz it was link up to boost which there phone are locked to that company and now it put it locked mode and I can’t get my full refund because I can’t sign out of my stuff so the policy says “if you can’t sign out of your stuff you get a 50% of your refund back” like cmon it’s not even my fault"

If anything goes wrong you have 90 days to turn it back and either get your money back or order another phone so it’s all worth it.P.S. I’m typing this review with phone right kow😊"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased two iPhone 11s (New). I have always been an Android user. I purchased the iPhone for its enhanced security. Here are the issues: The glass screen often does not respond so I find myself pressing an arrow or icon several times to get it to work. Whenever I use the phone for a WiFi hotspot, it will disconnect from whatever device I am connecting to after a few minutes. Also, the iPhone is not as user-friendly as an Android. If I could return my iPhones I would do it in a minute."

"Apple","iPhone 11","By far the easiest scratching screen on the market. I have a $50 Lg fiesta with a more scratch resistant screen. Do your research and don’t buy this phone! You’re welcome"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I've read a number of the reviews on these ""RENEWED"" phones and the primary point that tends to be missed is NOT just what the phone is delivered as when receiving the package, BUT what the USED phone is like a year later. On any USED item, this should be what is most important. When I first received my USED phone from BuySPRY, I thought it was ""incredible"". It literally looked and acted close to ""brand new"" and I saw no issues over the next month. THAT is a company that cares about its customer. Right? However, the one thing that adding a little spit polish and tightening a few things here and there does NOT offer is winding the clock backwards. With that said, SURE it's a nice USED. However, it IS USED. I probably saved around $100 on mine. My other Apple did well for about three years before it started slowing down a bit. I figured this one might be two ... maybe a year and a half? I mean, you get what you pay for here, right? NOPE. One YEAR LATER, the phone was already acting like my last Apple after THREE YEARS. In fact, it was acting WORSE. The battery charge was even a lot shorter. So, keep in mind that HERE you commonly DO NOT get what you pay for with these products. You can view this as saving a little $ up front. However, this phone should have been another $100 off. THAT is all it was worth. BUYER BEWARE!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I feel product is to expensive and if I would get a free one to test out that I would be able to give a better review."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es muy costosa para ser renovado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is a knock off...not the real iphone(bootlegged)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love my iPhone 11. Great camera great battery life stable OS and rapid charges. Would look for better prices elsewhere though."
"Apple","iPhone 11","i was going to purchase until i noticed all of the comments showed the 128gb purple iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","How is the renewdd iphone 11 is more expensive than the original new one from apple??,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Awful"
"Apple","iPhone 11","First of all, I’d like to say that I had an iPhone 7 prior to buying the iPhone 11 so it is QUITE the upgrade for me. I didn’t realize just how bad my previous phone was until I started using the new one. My other phone had the worst battery life and started dying on me 2 hours into work. I had to bring my charger with me everywhere. I am absolutely in love with how smooth the iPhone 11 is and how big the screen is. The battery life is MUCH better. I have been using it for about an hour just writing Amazon reviews and it has only gone down 5%. The facial recognition is a great feature but I think I liked the fingerprint feature more. I have had several instances where my friends/family take my phone out of my hands and hold it up to my face so they can access my photos and such. The fingerprint reader makes it more likely that they won’t be able to get in. Overall, my experience with this phone is a 9/10. The money I spent was absolutely worth the iPhone 11. Would be happy to purchase from this seller again!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was going to buy my girlfriend a bigger phone than her SE2020… but was worried about her not liking it not having a home button. Her fingers don’t always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasn’t to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don’t know if it’s 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don’t like those at all but it is on there very well so I’ll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was delivered 4 days earlier.Nice!I was trying to surprise my spouse but he opened the yellow large letter paper parcel.It was obvious it was a phone in a box. The phone had some nicks around the side antenna bars but was presented like new with sticky plastic on the phone. I had ready at hand a new phone screen protector and new phone case.The screen is clear. The back of the phone is clear.All buttons work. The camera works. The phone needed to charge. Setting up went well. Ringing and calling works well. All functions works great like new. Charges at 90% no problem. Does not die quickly. Does not randomly shuts off. Does not glitch. Does not lag. Does not freeze. Even the Apple symbol works to add a setting tool to use when you need an easy double and triple tap access. My spouse is happy with his like new phone and had it since the day before Valentines. We would try this seller again. It is not easy ordering electronic devices from businesses when we cannot see it touch the item on hand but WHEW! I can sure relax and know that the 90 days return is so helpful in case something goes wrong. I definitely made sure the Amazon item stated this because some do not state this. I prayed and I was hopeful upon arrival. Best device I brought in a long time on Amazon since my spouse’s Lap top I gifted💕"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I don’t write many reviews, however, there were some reviews about this iPhone that weren’t good. So I wanted to write a review myself.I highly recommend this phone.I will start by saying that I am impressed with the condition of my new phone. After inspecting the physical shape of the device I am very pleased to say that it looks almost perfect! Just looking at it you can't see anything wrong with it. But after looking closely there are a couple of very small scuff marks on the edge of the phone. But that's not a deal-breaker to me because that's covered by a case.The battery was charged more than 80% and the battery life of the phone is 100%. I have never owned a phone with a battery life over 85%. So far the batter has held a charge for 2 days after using it a good bit.Face recognition and other features work great I have no issues.The biggest perk of this phone has to be the speaker during phone calls. It works amazing! I can hear the person I'm talking to without having on speaker phone. This is a huge perk."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn’t know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn’t want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife’s phone from another seller didn’t have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasn’t a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Upgraded my phone from an XR to the 11 and have spent 24 hours with it at the time of review.Pros: I got more storage space (128GB vs 64GB), and the upgrade in the camera is great. I also love the green color and am glad it came with a screen protector already on it.Knowing this was a used phone, I wasn’t expecting perfection. However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as it’s backlight is more yellow than the XR screen. It could (and should) have been replaced prior to shipment. Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day). That said, those are the only two issues I’ve been able to find, so there’s no real complaint. The price was right for an upgraded phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","the phone worked well, but the face recognition did not work. I tried everything, but nothing and I had to send my phone to amazon to get my money back and I was left without phone for a couple of days."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its just like a brand new phone except: battery potential is limited at 89% and it came with a generic box and charger. I'm totally satisfied- the price was right. Thank you amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's renewed, which means it was used before. Mine didn't have any issues, except the maximum battery life was at 89% which is a little bit of a bummer but acceptable. Otherwise works well. This was a massive upgrade from my cruddy iPhone 6--it's much faster, better storage, larger, and double battery life. The cost for this renewed iPhone 11 was less than half the cost of a new iPhone 13, so I consider this a good deal. I'm happy with it. I chose red for the color and it looks nice."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Don't buy anything from BuySPRY! I didn't realize the issue was a defective product that BuySPRY sold me until after thier crappy warranty. It's obvious to me now that this phone never worked correctly and they sold me a defective product. I'm going to tell everyone that BuySPRY refurbished work is terrible or maybe not even refurbished. They cost me lots of money and heart ache with no concern or even care to offer a real solution. No one should buy thier junk but pay just a little more to get the something real."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone arrived quickly and was quiet clean. It already had a screen protector so that saved me a step. Battery life is very good, with maximum capacity of 97%. No issues with screen, camera, or Qi charging.My first refurb phone purchase, would buy from this vendor again."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far I’m very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and I’ve had so many bad experiencing buying “unlocked” phones in the past that aren’t unlocked.Anyway, I’m upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am a pleased customer and I’ve been using this phone for a bout 3 months to ensure I have a fair review. I am impressed and I just wanna say thank youMinor scratches on the bezel but it’s all good everything works 90% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Reviews ask for battery life, facial recognition, and fingerprint reader. The facial recognition software and fingerprint reader are ios software so that should be the same across all devices. That being said they both work as they should on the device. The device was in great shape, looked like a phone I would get at the store of my service provider. But my black and red service provider doesn't sell devices outright, so here we are. Order her this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and upon powering it up, setting it up I am more than happy with the purchase. If you need a bare device these guys sell a good product, no scratches, no cracks, full functionality etc. Came with the new USB c charger block and cord wrapped, and the Sim card tool. Looks brand new and the price was decent. I am satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was looking for a newer iPhone for my 12 year old daughter (she had the iPhone 6) but I didn't wanna break the bank cuz kids are hard on phones this was perfect came in great condition and she loved it definitely recommended"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got phone quicker than promised! I was worried when it said sprint unlocked, when it advertised ATT renewed. But took it to Att store and downloaded, should say mirrored my iphone 6 onto it and working great. I wish the ring tones were louder is one downsize. Also not having the button at bottom anymore takes getting used to swiping. All in al great seller for speed of delivery and nice phone! thx"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery health is 83% from original, which is worse than my iPhone 8 from 4 years ago.Small nick on the volume up, a medium scuff in the middle of the screen, and a few chips in the corners.There's a small white blur from screen burn-in at the bottom left.Everything else is still to be found out.If you want to keep for long term, find a better renewed or keep returning until you don't get one with these issues."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This iPhone 11 came at a great price and it was in pretty good condition. Not great, but that is to be expected from a refurbished iPhone. Has a few scratches here & there, but nothing too major. The battery was at 93% of its life; therefore, it is still really good. Everything works on the iPhone and more importantly my daughter was able to upgrade from an 8 to the 11 without us having to agree to a new contract with AT&T."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I broke my cellphone and needed something fast. Delivery was quick and cell phone looked in almost brand new condition. There was a few scuffs on the screen which was sort of disappointing but overall was a great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","When buying a refurbished/renewed phone make sure the seller is reliable. The seller that I purchased from is “Avant Solutions” the phone came in good condition, no scratches on the screen except the notch area which you can notice when you put a flashlight to it. The back as very tiny dents about the size of the point of a knife. There are also a few nicks which are extremely small these imperfections on the back are unnoticeable outdoors and from a distance, you really only notice these flaws when u angle it right. So yea this phone has extremely minor signs of use. The battery health is at 89%. Facial recognition works perfectly the cameras are normal the way it is on any iphone 11 and also runs great. I play cod on it quite a but and it runs smoothly on high graphic settings and doesn’t heat up much either. Also delivered a few days earlier than estimated."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone arrived sooner than expected. Came in a sturdy box, new charger. iPhone 11 - Looked like new, no scratches, no dings. Fired it up, transferred my info & apps - and off we went. Very impressed with it. And price was very reasonable. I will definitely buy from them again. Already recommended them to friends and family. **pic is representative of phone I ordered**"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought in February. Discovered that small crack on front was not smudge. Also - touch to open does not work--Have to tap side button. Too late to do anything but keep phone. Probably would not buy refurbished model next time. Love my Apple products but this was a disappointment."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This item arrived earlier than expected however I am more than pleased I had no problem activating it with my carrier it came just as said! The only thing missing was the little tool to get to the Sim card but I guess if that’s The worst thing that could happen I’m OK with it. Still hoping they send me one though after reading this review"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came in a really obscure android box which got me sweating a little bit but when I opened it, I was more than happy. It looked brand new. It came with a screen protector already on it and with the charging adapter and chord. The setup was good, and I’ve been using it for 2 months. The only thing I can say that was a little annoying was that it took forever to charge and the charger adapter stopped working which is an easy fix. You can always buy a new adapter if you really so choose which is what I did and I’ve been happy ever since. So if you’re going to buy this and need confirmation it’s worth it, this is it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo trabaja mal, tiene manchas en las fotos al tomarlas , volumen del Speakers muy bajo, bateria se descarga muy rápido , lo devolví y estoy esperando la devolución del
Dinero"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I loved that everything came as described and more. I was expecting a battery capacity of around 90 85 percent, which would have been as the description. I received it with 100 capacity. It has scratches on the display and other parts of the phone but nothing that hinders the experience. I know it was a used phone so my expectations were lower, thankfully my expectations were met and even exceeded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the phone expecting I would see some evidence that it was a used phone, but, no no real sign except that it came with after market charging cable and charger. No matter, they worked great. The phones functionality was as described and everything worked. Ito be fair Ihave only had it forabouta week."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got the phone as a gift for my cousin who loves it. Out of the box she was able to get it to work with Metro PCS without issues. Talk, text, internet, she has had no issues. The battery lasts over 3 days without having to recharge (she is a lighter user.) Amazing value for an amazing unit."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came in pretty good condition. I was a little worried about battery power since it’s renewed and the last renewed phone I bought off here the battery power was horrible, it needed charged throughout the day and certain apps would drain the battery within 20 minutes. But this phone the battery lasts me alllll day! And the apps I use don’t drain it so I would recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Checks all of the boxes. We all know what we’re getting into buying a renewed phone but I was very surprised with this one. Battery is at 100% even comes with a tempered glass installed perfectly. There was only one small little scratch but it’s very unnoticeable and the case hides it anyway. I was apprehensive but I’m very happy with what I got. Plus with Apple no longer giving charging bricks out the box might as well buy this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent product!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought the phone for my 16 year old daughter. The phone come in a day early and it come with a phone charger and a block.It was in perfect condition no scratches or cracks. I was nervous about buying a phone on amazon but I figured I would give it a shot and I am very happy with the phone and so is my daughter."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I really like the phone as a whole. Charge holds pretty well, maybe just get some good charger depending on the charger it can take a little while to charge compared to my last phone. Service is great with metro pcs. The camera is FANTASTIC! Serious quality! This is my favorite iPhone yet!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this iPhone about 6 months ago and it has performed exactly like it is supposed to. Apple makes products that just work and they support them better than anybody else. I recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was hesitant to buy an iPhone over the Internet but to my amazement this is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Phone looks brand new no scratches no dents everything works flawlessly. I bought the iPhone 11 in purple and I can’t believe all the things it does compared to my iPhone 7. Stop searching you’ve found your new iPhone from this company!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","96% battery. no scratches on the screen, side or back. Face ID works well and camera is perfect. The phone came in 4 days. It also came with a charger and charger box. 3months later and my phone is still working fine, will update at 6 months."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I ordered this without looking too closely at the reviews and after ordering decided to look more closely, and let me tell you I was stressed. But when i got the product in the mail it was in perfect working condition i transferred my data from my iphone 7 to this one super easily. Everything works, microphone, camera, calls, facetime, videos, and not to mention the battery life is pretty kick ass. If youre thinking about it but you’re unsure just do it. Im very happy with it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I am very un pleased with my purchase . I received the phone locked ! I’ve spent too much time on the phone with my carrier trying to transfer my number onto this phone . They informed me that the phone was locked . I contacted Amazon after about 30 minutes they finally told me to contact the carrier . When I purchase an item I expect it to come as said ."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I ended up unable to use this iPhone 11 (nothing wrong with the iPhone) but I did not realize iPhone 11 could not do 5G. I sent it back through Amazon's refund process around 45 days after receiving it and followed all of the Avant Company's information request in the box with the iPhone. My refund showed as pending within 2 days of Avant receiving the iPhone. Very satisfied and pleased with Avant as a Complany and being gracious to refund due to my mistake."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery life is outstanding like it’s brand new! I did have some issues with the software but after it updated it fixed upon itself! The thickness of the phone is amazing and feels good on hands, and the sheerness of the phone is like it’s brand new! Thank you for the glass protector that came installed with the phone! I will be purchasing other phones from them in the future!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","This is a good purchase for my iPhone. It protects the phone well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo enviaron a tiempo, todo en Perfecto estado. Volvería a comprar un celular con Uds"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like everything about the product from the color all the way to its hardware"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Whenever I first purchase this phone it was because my dogs decided to chew up my iPhone X I had for 3 years. Everywhere I looked the iPhone 11 was $800-$1,000. I was very skeptical about buying a used iPhone off of amazon and whenever i unpackaged the phone the ""Smart Phone"" box it came in was all bent and opened at the top but surprisingly and thankfully the iPhone was perfectly fine, came with a full battery, no cracks or dinged places. And the transfer over with just my old sim card was so easy and hassle free. I am in love with my new phone, definitely with all my money!!"

Didn’t come in the iPhone box but it’s okay it didn’t bother me much. It was fully unlocked and like new like I said. I bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Also great camera. Battery life is pretty long about 8 hours if your mostly on your phone but charges pretty fast."
"Apple","iPhone 11","To my surprise, the phone works in fantastic condition, and came in fantastic condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","¡¡Es maravilloso!!, batería 100% ¡Estado físico perfecto!, venía en caja original, incluye garantía de Apple y Apple tv gratis un año... Es nuevo en verdad, pero tengan cuidado no todos los vendedores dan estas maravillosas condiciones. Estoy más que feliz con el producto. Compré otro iPhone y resultó con una falla, lo regrese a Amazon y sin problema, da confianza comprar estos productos por qué siempre te dejan regresarlos si se presenta algun inconveniente. Quisiera comprar más pero este vendedor ya no tiene más disponibles."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es bastante rápido y la cámara bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","this is the most fraglie phone i ever had , the phone doesnt even have to fall far for it to have some serious damages my phone fell off my bed onto the carpet floor and theirs already a line and some weird black ink on my phone but the weirdest part about the ink that appeared on my phone , i blew into my speaker and the ink started to go away but with one small accident it will come back. oh and each time my phone had a fall i had a screen protecter and hard case on no damage to the screen protecter at all it only happens to the phone. dont spend crazy money like this on a used phone i realized its buying someones elses problem, even though i thought the company that sold me this phone would take care of it and fix it . SAVE YOUR MONEY IM WARNING YOU."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I have always used an android phone. I find that the assumption that people should automatically know how to use an iphone is ignorant. I have struggled to learn how to use this phone right down to how to turn it on and off. I purchase it so that I would be able to do face time with my granddaughter. My sons have iphones. They don't live nearby, so they can't show me how to use them. A little help goes a long way. I also find that the phone doesn't hold a charge for a decent amount of time."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received phone sooner than expected. Phone looks as new. No scratches that I can detect. Works smooth and quick. I really like the green color. All my other phones were the standard black. A nice change."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Usually when you buy and think about refurbished devices, they may have minor damages or they’re in bad quality... but wow. My device came with no scratches and with 98% battery life!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I had a problem with the screen seal.

I use a good protective rubber case and usually keep my iPhone in my home. The phone has never been submerged in water. I dropped it on the floor of my home once or twice.

However, one day, I spilled coconut oil on the kitchen counter, causing the coconut oil to seep inside the phone, behind the screen, damaging it.

The apple store said the screen seal on this phone was not intact. Was it broken from the beginning? I do not know how the seal could have broken during my usage.

Other than a broken screen seal, the phone works."
"Apple","iPhone 11","There is nothing wrong with my phone, it is at 86% battery life but it isn’t noticeable as my phone lasts all day without needing a charge unless I am constantly on it. The face recognition works perfectly as well."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was unsure of buying this phone but I’m glad I made this purchase. The phone works great and I haven’t had any problems with it at all. I’ve had the phone for three months now and nothing bad has happened. It’s very durable too. The battery lasts literally all day and it charges super fast. Best purchase I’ve made."

"Apple","iPhone 11","The iPhone I received looks almost brand new aside from a small scratch on the button that switches the phone to silent. Honestly you can barely tell it’s there and it disappears completely when you put a case on it. The phone came with a screen protector, charger, and an almost full battery. 10/10 Highly recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Until now it’s been working perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great buy. I got my iPhone 11 in green. Phone was pristine as stated in the description. No scraped on screen or body. No after market modifications. 100% satisfied. Battery health was 84% but this is a 3 year old so I'm not disappointed."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Great phone! Great quality! Face recognition tests me though, sometimes it just doesn’t recognize me and that gives me anxiety."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is great! I got it as my first phone for my daughter and she loves it! A couple of things about it though. First, the battery life is kind of bad, it goes down very quickly. But the charger that comes with it is AMAZING. This phone is excellent! If you're looking for a new phone, I recommend it. Just letting you know, though, the phone is pretty big and might not fit into girls' clothes pockets. Really, though, this phone is awesome!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo que pedí tal cual hermoso sin un rasguño"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Gift for my grandson"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La verdad tenia miedo de comprarlo x amazon ya que no vivo en USA, pero la verdad vale la pena! buenísimo, lo he exprimido al máximo ( lo he usado continuamente en google meet, clases, etc.) y otras actividades que requieren bastante energía de un celular en todos los sentidos, y tanto en la batería cómo en las funciones funciona a la perfección!

"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased this phone and was expecting it to be unlocked. But to my surprise, the phone was locked. When I took this to my carrier, they explained that this phone belongs to another user and they can not unlock it. I even tried contacting their customer service but no luck. Hopefully, I'll get a refund!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esta muy bonito, el color me encanta"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love buying my iPhones from Amazon. The price is always great and both that I bought here are perfect. No scratches or glitches. You can feel safe ordering one from here."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I'm surprised by the quality. Absolutely, it looks like new, the battery comes with 100% of health. It took a little delay to be delivered; 2 days after the deadline."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is the 3rd phone I order from Amazon and I’m super happy with the amazing condition of the product. Not a single scratch, everything works well and battery is holding up! Thanks AMZ!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Love my phone, thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Perfecto estado , muy buen equipo."

"Apple","iPhone 11","this is such a good deal for upgrading your iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo bien!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m satisfied with the purchase. It came with a little scratch on the screen, it’s a used phone. Expecting perfection is unreliable. Plus, I have 90 days to return it if it malfunctions. It look good taking in consideration it’s a used device. I purchased a case and a screen protector. I will never see the scratch! As long as is functioning like it should, everything is good. I would recommend you to buy it, but don’t discard the box in case you have to return it. One more thing, don’t use the cheap charge it brings. Use original equipment. Thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Reading reviews on this was difficult, it was hard to make out what my phone would look like. Everyone was saying it had a little bit of scratches, They were right. The phone had little to no scratches. there was one little scratch on the back camera but it wasn’t affecting the phone it’s self. Everything was fine. The battery life was 30% when it came in, but the max battery capacity was 97%. Which is good, considering I got acceptable condition. I would recommend buying, but I’m not sure yet, I have only had it for 3 days."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good phone, worth the price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came early all accessories great condition like new ordered my daughter one after I received mine"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."

"Apple","iPhone 11","It came on time and nothing is wrong, so far very happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came in perfect condition no scratches or cracks. Although coming without a SIM card was kind of complicated to set up. But everything else worked perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This Iphone was in my price range."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just as described from seller came brand new just wish they also included an original charging cord and box my son loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great condition but battery health at 87%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came in good condition no scratches and came unlocked, I have cricket and it was compatible with it as soon as I put the sim in which was one of my biggest scares because of all the reviews on it being unlocked and not unlocked for some. The only issue I do have is that the battery life was at 84% which isn’t bad but I expected more but I can always replace my battery other than that I do recommend 😁"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Some time phone is on but screen is full black"
"Apple","iPhone 11","the battery life was 89 percent witch is good and could be replaced i got the 64 gigs an it had no scratches but it didn't have a screen pertecter but it overall is worth the money works perfectly good for first phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was great except for the fact they left the box on the floor"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product arrived correctly. Everything as advertised. Good quality, fast delivery. Battery in good health. I recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente producto y vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Phone came in the Amazon renewed package. It had a charger and a cord but was not the apple ones. The phone is in very good condition. No scratches except some scuffs in the screen. The battery is at 85 percent. Other then that it’s very good."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La bateria no vino en condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ninguno"
"Apple","iPhone 11","My phone’s battery capacity is at 81 percent which explain why it does faster. Having been an android user in the past, I really like how intuitive iPhone is. The phone works pretty well but the cable that they sent didn’t work for me. I’ll recommend getting yourself an apple cable as they give a third party cable and they don’t give adapter which was surprising for me. But the phone is good although it has a tiny dot on my display for no reason. I’ll still recommend get it as the price is too good and you’re also being nicer to environment"
"Apple","iPhone 11","To be honest I was expecting like 80% batt health since it was refurbished, but then it came 90% and I was really happy. Came with screen protector. Oh also i bought it for my sister and she likes it, so yeah"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Its worth the price, i got 100% battery life and perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It’s perfect! Worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The bottom right of my screen kept turning black so I returned it. They got my money back extremely fast and had amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend buying from this company. I bought a different phone from them instead because I read that this phone is known for having the black in the corner :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product was perfect definitely a must buy!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Product was perfect definitely a must buy!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and they’ve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If you’re looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had the phone for a month now and when I got it came in a white box, with no original charger box just a white cable and black generic box. After the plastic was remove the phone showed very little to no damage at all, very small scratches around the corners of the screen from past use but you can barely notice it with a screen protector and a phone case on it. The battery life was 87% when I got it but now it has gone up to 91%, but the battery is amazing and lasts all day. It is fast and reliable. Value for your money, yes. Fave recognition also is fast, the camera is great too, overall great buy"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works great, it came fast, and works like it's brand new. There was a few scratches but that's expected with a refurbished device. The battery life was at 88%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone so quick I needed a quick replacement I was very skeptical of buying a phone from Amazon and it is way cheaper than the ones at other stores and it works great I’ve had mine for two months now it works amazing and it also comes with a apple charger which works amazing as well and I will never buy a phone at retail price again especially since it came a whole week earlier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived a day early, and seems to be in good condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","muy buen estado!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came with 88% battery health and its not unlocked it also has some scratch’s present."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was weary buying a refurbished phone but it didn’t have any marks on it and after a little over 2 months it still works great and battery life is 93% the camera, face id and everything work great. No reason to buy a brand new phone when these come so much cheaper"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ok. Child didn't complain"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I was skeptical about this product but it was so good I had to leave a review. The phone is like brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Over all excellent condition battery life was 85% which is is still decent, return policy is great if there are any issues"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came very nice. No scratches or dents. Works amazingly!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was a little Skeptical about this purchase but it got here so fast! This is the 3rd day in use out of the box and the phone is WONDERFUL! Battery, Screen, Camera is GREAT! Will be posting pics later ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This item was an affordable replacement. I have been more than pleased with the functionality of this item. Would buy again. Holds charge for 24 hours in area with poor reception."
"Apple","iPhone 11","love love love my new phone it’s been a couple months and it works perfectly fine!! sometimes weird stuff happens but i think it’s because i drop it too much T-T anyways amazing!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I can’t believe how great of a deal that I’ve gotten with this phone. I know it says refurbished, but I don’t see any blemishes or anything wrong with it. It has a lot to do with the Company that I’ve dealt with,The companies name is (buy spry) and they were great in sending me an excellent phone and in great condition. I would highly recommend this company if you’re looking for a less expensive phone but just as good as all the other ones that are out there. I’m very satisfied with this purchase from this company. I bought this iPhone 11 with my own money, nobody’s paying me to write this review. Again I would recommend this phone just Because the company stand’s by their word and will send you a great phone at a reasonable price.One last comment about this phone I included a photo of the battery life, it’s 95%. That’s great in my book."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Just got my iPhone. This was my first time buying anything in condition called Renewed, but I understand that it's Refurbished. It made no difference! I was really happy with the quality, it looks and works great. It came a day early too, so I'm really happy. Thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Was gifted an upgrade from my iPhone 6S due to deteriorating battery life. 11 is bigger and doesn’t have a home button…which are both taking some getting use to. Overall for being a refurbished phone, there was just a minor sticky residue on the side, it is in amazing condition. Came with a cord and a charging adapter. Not original Apple but that was in the description. There was also a screen protector, I think a glass one. It blended in pretty well but because it was off center I took it off. Still trying to figure out how to clean it without wrecking the sticky side. Battery life is much better even though this one shows 84% max capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 11","As of right now the iPhone is in almost pristine condition. There are tiny scratches in the square camera area but nonetheless is in excellent condition."
"Apple","iPhone 11","quick delivery and great product would buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 I was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews but I decided to try it out anyways. It got here today and so far has worked fine! It looks brand new and the battery health is at 99%. The screen responds to my touch just fine and there were no problems connecting my Apple ID. It hasn’t restarted or shut off randomly at all. There’s still opportunity for it to do something strange but right now I’m very happy with it! :)"

Were white. I really tried to make the phone work for me but the pixels won in the end.
Returned, no hassle.
I would definitely try them again, and probably will after this phone dies ."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Although the battery health is 89% I am over all satisfied with the phone. It looks new, no visible wear on the surface. The product works almost as if it is new as well. Even with the lower battery health level the phone was definitely worth every penny. The seller also overnighted the phone at no extra charge which was really amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Used it. Sent it back. Forgot how boring iphones are. Went back to samsung."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far it works good my daughter loved it, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the screen protector came broken which was a bummer! But other than that everything works good so far, I'll write another review if it messes up fast ,"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I was apprehensive about purchasing a telephone online as I’m more of a tangible person. With that being said I did, however, order a refurbished phone from Amazon. This turned out to be one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. The phone arrived with not a scratch on it; looks brand new. After putting in my original Sim card from my 2013 phone, everything just started rolling and no problems were encountered. Highly recommend purchasing this phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Recommended! Great phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is like new. the only little blemish is on the protective screen, which I could replace. the battery is at 90-percent, the phone was shipped with a cable and wall charger, plus a SIM remover thingy. The only issue is that it does not connect to my Mac probably because I would need an original Apple cable."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my second purchase within 2 weeks. Great phone. Well packaged. Arrived earlier than expected delivery date. I bought as a gift for my friend. I will recommend"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone was just overall pretty good I absolutely love it I seen a few bad reviews about the product but still decided to order it and trust me it’s worth your money. When the phone first got here it wasn’t letting my Apple ID sign in how to fix this is you, Go to settings, go to general, then go to rest and press erase all content and settings. After you do all of that you should be good!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I just received my phone. I am new to Apple products. I also just received my IPad. I will add more feedback later. I'm so happy"

But phone is great camera quality is good like a brand new phone my phone came with no scratches , no glitching problems or anything. I love it , and I also love the pretty red color .

"Apple","iPhone 11","a"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pretty good overall, the phone runs smoothly and all the technical features run like their basically brand new. The only downside is the minor scuffs on the back and the sides of the phone which I suppose is to be suspected of a used phone. It also came with a screen protector so that was nice."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Best"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is hard to trust renewed phones but truly a renewed (in excellent condition) iPhone is the best way to buy an IPhone. Don't spend the near $1000 when you can just get a renewed iPhone from a year or 2 ago. Mine came with a few imperfections though, a noticeable scratch on the top frame near the antennae and a few chips of the casing above the cameras. However, the camera was in perfect condition and the screen so for me that's a win but for others it might not be. But I do have to say for saying over $600 I am happy with my purchase."

"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone is just what I needed and came just as advertised. The battery life is great, there were no scratches on the screen, and the phone works as it should. I just can’t bring myself to pay full price for a brand new phone but at the same time I still want a high-quality used one and this fits the bill perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like my phone a lot works with no interruptions, came as expected no scratches. best of all it was easy to pair with my current service"
"Apple","iPhone 11","met my expectations"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this as a gift for my sister & it came really quick! It was a bit scratched but nothing a phone case can’t fix! They were hardly noticeable & she still loved it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I never usually like to buy refurbished technology, especially Iphones just for the fact that they are essential for everyday use. I need them to work well and have a long battery life to last an all day use if necessary. When I first came across this Iphone I was extremely skeptical. The price was something that I could not beat anywhere else, but the fact that it was refurbished made me slightly nervous. I did not want to break the bank on a brand new Iphone simply because 500+ dollars seems so unnecessary to me. So, the price to this phone ultimately caught my eye. I considered it for a while and decided to buy it. If it didn't work or if it had too much cosmetic damage that I did not like I would return it. The phone came three days early which extremely shocked me. It did not come in the original Apple packaging, but it did come with a charger and a USB charging block. When I removed the Iphone from the packaging it came in I was blown away. The phone had no scratches, no damages, no nothing. It wasn't in excellent condition it was in perfect condition. The only thing that made me nervous was the fact of it being considered ""unlocked."" I read other reviews of people saying that the phone was not unlocked and that it did not accept their carrier. So, immediately upon opening the phone I stuck in my sim card, and sure enough the phone was unlocked and accepted my sim card. Then from there I tested out the audio, face recognition, battery life, touch screen, and other parts of the phone, and found nothing wrong. I am extremely happy with my purchase and hope that this phone lasts me quite a long time. I have only had it for roughly two to three days upon the submission of this review, but I am hoping that it works well past the 90 day return guarantee that comes with the phone. If you are being skeptical about buying this phone, don't be. I do hope that you experience the same results as I did because I am beyond happy with my decision, and I hope that you will be too."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Came packaged nicely, and came a day early! Very pleased with this purchase! Thankyou :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is as good as new, super happy with my purchase!!! 10/10 experience would buy again"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ve had my phone for a couple months now and it works great. I’ve had no issues. It’s fast and the battery life is great."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I got this phone a couple months back and I was very skeptical being that it was used. You never know what it’ll be like till you have it. Worth the money! The face recognition is amazing and the battery life was at 94%! It had a little tiny scuff mark by the camera and on the screen, not even visible unless you’re looking for it, but that is it! I 100% recommend buying this product!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This phone came with a three foot long charging cable, a charging block, and a SIM card tray opener. I have had this phone for almost 72 hours (Will update if anything goes wrong) and I have had no problems whatsoever. Touchscreen works great, camera quality is amazing, there’s no cracks or large blemishes, it’s an overall amazing purchase, especially for the price. The one annoying thing is that is doesn’t come with a SIM card, but those can be easily purchased off of Amazon as well. This was money well spent in my opinion, perfect for teenagers or people who just don’t want to spend over a grand on a phone."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I received my apple iPhone 11 in “good” condition. I expected it to be in a little better condition than what I received. It has a ton of scratches and Knicks on the corners and sides, the paint is missing near the power button from deep scratches. The rear camera has a deep scratch across the glass also. It has a warning that the screen has been replaced with a cheaper screen than apple. The warning will not go away. Also it has a warning wanting to activate it on metro/T-Mobile. I’m with a different provider so I don’t know what it keeps wanting to change my sims card over to T-Mobile. So those two things are annoying. Everything else seems to work fine. Functionality 100%. Cosmetically I’d say it’s like 75%. The condition seemed more of a “fair” instead of good but that’s my opinion. Im content with it, I just expected it to be in better shape for what i paid."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good job iphone11"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was great I got it one day before expected it didn’t came in the original box but it was great for the moment everything works great and the health battery is on 100 percent it was unlocked and it didn’t even came with a scratch I was nervous until I got it and saw it was good I’m really happy 😊 I recommend it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came and I love it
It’s the best iPhone 📱"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Exactly what I needed ! When I originally received the order, it did not come in the original Apple packaging, the box was crushed in one corner, and the package was extremely hot. I was scared since I have not had good experiences buying electronics second hand before. Despite the crushed box, the phone was safe with protective wrapping, and the distributor even added a screen protector for me ! I bought some glass protectors to add but now I don’t have to immediately open that package because the seller has kindly given me one. The charger and plug work good, I use my old Apple charger and have the one that came with this phone saved for travel. It has been a month since I’ve had this phone, and the condition is great. the camera quality is much better than my old 7 plus, and the battery life is also MUCH better. The color is very beautiful as well! I do sometimes find my phone glitching, but that may be because I run many applications at once and overwork the phone. All in all, this was a good purchase, although it was quite pricey."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the quality of the iPhone and it’s color."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything was perfect! It came in super clean but the only thing i noticed as a little dust in earpiece speaker grill."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was a good purchase! I was very pleased with the product. iPhone 11 works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is as explained “renewed” just like new everything works like it should"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Amazing go buy your new iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","was nervous to get an iPhone off of amazon, but for the price this is amazing and totally worth it! even comes with a charger :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Arrived a day early, looks brand new. Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face ID was not working."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The battery health isn’t as good but overall phone is gret"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The microphone that’s used for speaker phone, FaceTime, and talk to text DOESNT work so that’s cool.... called apple to make sure it wasn’t a problem with the software and it’s not"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent and easy setup"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Scratched up, horrible, OLD, a total disappointment"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great. Quality phone. Battery health 87% was hoping for 90%. iPhone 11 fits in my pocket better than iPhone 8 Plus."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything perfect. Fast and efficient delivery. Product in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything perfect. Fast and efficient delivery. Product in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I truly love my phone! It is what I wanted. I cannot take a picture of my telephone as I’m on it, LOL. The phone is what they said and it is working perfectly well!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","10/10 recommend came looking and acting brand new! No flaws, get it get it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great product, arrived quickly, like new!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciona"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The product allows you to do and create so many things such as; Texting, calling, using social media, you can even create art and edit photos that you’ve taken with its Dual 12MP Wide and Ultra Wide cameras and so much more. This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers. It’s all red, with the word “(Product) RED” on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.
You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you don’t know how to use it they come with a “HOW TO” so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.
What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.
The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didn’t come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didn’t come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone that’s newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didn’t have any updates to the screen, so it’s still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.
In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what I’m talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like the way this phone case looks on my red phone but more importantly it is tough - it withstands drops well. I also like that it's really slim."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’m so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. I’m not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. That’s right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Face ID perfecto, batería al 100% y sin rayones ni nada por el estilo. encantadísimo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased the yellow iPhone 11 64gb unlocked and overall it is a pretty great phone. Even though the reviews were iffy, I still decided to take that chance. Once I got the phone it came with a screen protector which was a pretty good bonus. It also came with a charger and adapter (not from apple but works just as good). I did notice a few things that were definitely wrong. My ringer button does not work at all. It is a very tiny green dot in the left corner which isn’t noticeable at all and it honestly took me a few days to even notice it. It did disappoint me that I’m not able to purchase apple care for this phone but that is ok because my phone company offers a better deal (T-Mobile). I am coming from a iPhone 6s so this is a huge upgrade and it was definitely worth it so overall it is a pretty good deal for the price so if you’re thinking about making that purchase then go right ahead."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Nothing wrong with it, everything I hoped for!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good condition"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pantalla sin rayas, bordes intactos y estado de batería 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","First time ever having an iPhone so I was nervous buying one, but I love it. I got it in my favorite color and now I make fun of all my Android owning associates. Only problem is Siri gives me so much sass, but I gave him a silly accent so it’s all cool beans."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great Product , got delivered on time and product amazing !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","At first I was happy because the phone came with screen protector. How sweet! Then I notice there’s some bobbles under it so I tried to fix it. Then I found another surprise. The phone was scratched all over but with the screen protector it won’t showed. I was not happy about it. Returned it right the way."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Looked like a brand new phone, no marks, smudges or scratches to be found. Came with aftermarket USB charger and lightening cable. Was cleared to be freshly set up. I verified IMEI with Apple. And had no problem porting my phone number to it from ATT to T-mobile."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Don’t miss out"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Hey y’all so I wasn’t sure if I could rely on the best product and service here but honestly I’m so happy I gave it a go! I ordered the phone and by the next day before sundown it was in my hands in a fedex bubbler mailer - it was in an Amazon renewed box and already had power . Transportation of SIM card and previous iPhone material was super simple ! Even better it comes with SIM card device remover , block and charger (seem nice) , and a screen protector! I’m definitely pleased so far but I’m writing this not even a day of having phone in use so let’s just hope I can continue to be happy with this phone for a very long time!! I went from an iPhone 6se to this so from that standpoint I must say Apple why are so addictive??!! Lol bye guys hope whatever you choose brings you happiness too :)"

"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone case at a very suitable price. I think it's good. It also feels good in your hand."
"Apple","iPhone 11","This is my husband’s first iPhone and he now loves it. The facial recognition feature is great for him when he’s busy doing projects and cannot use his hands for the fingerprint reader.

The battery life is very good, and I’m very impressed with how long the battery lasts especially for an iPhone.

Also, the camera is very good and able to take very nice shots.

This phone was for my husband, and I definitely want to look at getting one for myself too, now."
"Apple","iPhone 11","to start i did not receive the phone in an iphone box , which is fine with me it still came with a charger but not the original iphone charger that usally comes in the box . when i took the phone out there was visible dirt and grime on the phone and in the holes of the phone like the charging port , speakers etc. after a few minutes of digging and scraping i managed to get most of it out but not completely . the only damage to the phone was two scratches near the charging port but THATS IT. the phone was unlocked , the battery life is at 84% , fast shipping (actually came a day earlier) it’s worth it and easy to set up and use so go ahead and buy it ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","great product, arrived much earlier than expected and the device is perfect and impeccable"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This was perfect. It worked with my SIM card immediately, connected to my Apple ID and worked perfect. I knew there were very minor imperfections, but they were so minuscule I barely noticed. Exactly what I needed with a quick turn around."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El artículo está en buen estado, sin embargo, el sonido tiene detalle"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good service and product. No issues with phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","All in all The phone was in good condition, barely any scratches no screen cracks the battery life works amazing it works like new. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to buy the iPhone 11."
"Apple","iPhone 11","- Battery percentage came at 81% (written above 80%, that's funny as i expected it would have 90-100% , 1% more and the job is done, congrats ;-) )
- Came with a Charger and a cable
- The phone itself hasn't got any signs of use, if you look too closely, you can see 1 or 2 little kinda holes."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone came quite neat. Battery health was 84%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Because the item contains non-Apple components, I must set it up and erase it with a Bluetooth keyboard. And the whole time felt like being repeatedly kicked in the teeth... Talk about leaving a bad taste in my mouth."
"Apple","iPhone 11","came just like it looked, super cute and for a really good price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","My husband phone died and he does the majority of his work on his cell phone so this was a very dire situation. Was not interested in going to my local cell phone store so headed to Amazon to grab this phone. I paid a fraction of what I would through my cell phone company and it is the perfect phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works great looks great. Love it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I haven’t taken off the package stickers off the screen yet (is a gift) but it does look in extremely good condition. It was well packaged. It came with a new charger and a usb c cable. A lot more than expected. I will for now give this seller a 5 star. If I have any complains later I hope they take care of any issues that might come up. In regard to the price they were the cheapest but again it does look like new."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like everything"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought as a gift I have no other information about it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Face recognition,fingerprint also battery life Best!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Good prices works great"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The camera comes with three microphones (selfie camera, front camera, and phone talk camera) and the microphone for regular cell phone calls , located next to the power input, had scratchy noise and people could barely hear me even since I received it. I did not have a phone protection cover. I had to call Apple and after troubleshooting, they wanted $400 to repair. So I returned to the seller as it is obvious that they had not done their quality check.The only good thing is that I received my money refund fast, within 4 days of shipping the return."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excellent condition, came with screen protector and charger! Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I purchased my phone from 'Buyspry' and there were very few scratches on it. It came with a screen protector already installed and 90% battery health, which is very rare for renewed phones. It arrived a lot earlier than expected and it's truly beautiful! I would recommend buying from 'buyspry'."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tal vez lo único que pude notar como enfático es que el cargador no es el original o un genérico aaa, si no un cargador de una marca no reconocida"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I bought this phone as a gift for my little nephew back in Vietnam and was a little worried that it might not be unlocked like some reviews mentioned or won't work international. But it was super simple set up. She just popped her Sim in was able to use it right away.For a used phone the battery life held up really well! I left the phone on for 3 days at full charge and it only went down to 75%. No scratches and dents to the phone. My nephew was very happy with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 11","👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","👍"
"Apple","iPhone 11","works great ""battery life"" , ""thickness"" and ""value for the money"" was so much helpful when you have 2 teenagers Thank you James and family"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I like this yellow one, it can be used as usual, good price"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I love how it turn out I will recommend it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Couldn’t even tell it was used so glad I purchased"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far so good. I bought this for my 16 year old son and it arrived within a week. It's a very nice phone. It came in really good shape couldn't tell it was renewed other than the damaged box and the charger it came with didn't charge it more than a couple percent in the 30 minutes it was plugged in. It arrived with a completely empty battery which was a bummer but my son charged it to 56 percent, did an update, uploaded his apps, and transferred all his data and after 2 hours the battery was only down 4 percent. He was really happy with it. And he said the camera was great. Him and his brother were having so much fun playing with the features. This is the second renewed apple product I've purchased and I recommend buying Amazon renewed to a lot of my friends. The great customer service and 90 day guarantee are really comforting. The phone had no signs of wear at all."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Described as unlocked. It WAS locked. Second phone from this company I returned. First one died in two days."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Decia nuevo y el cel tenia algunos pelados por los lados"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I Love it! At first, I was very skeptical and prepared myself to send it back expecting to be disappointed. When I got the package the box said it was sanitized and the smell co-signed that 100%. The phone had no scratches on the body and was virtually perfect, only scratch found was a somewhat length scuff on the vertical half portion of the upper screen which seems to be fixable if some sort of adhesive was applied. With a screen protector, the scratch isn't even noticeable and the battery health was 100%. Got a 256GB for the price of the 128, I'm satisfied for now. I'll report any defects in the future but so far I definitely recommend this."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Everything on it works. I am pleased to see that the battery life is at a 100% which means I have a brand new phone. They did a very good job with this refurbished phone and I even got a screen protector on it."
"Apple","iPhone 11","iPhone 11 came in basically brand new and WITH a screen protector. Only thing is don’t expect a Apple IPhone box, it comes with a after market charger and little cardboard box where the phone came in. Other than that the phone is working perfect !!! I am very satisfied!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","In the 10 years that I’ve owned smartphones I have always had androids. I had a galaxy S9 but I accidentally cracked the screen, so I decided to get the S10 on a whim. I immediately hated it. I’ve been just tolerating it for 9 months, and was prepared to just tolerate it for the full 2 years. But then I found this deal on a refurb iPhone 11!Like everyone else I was a little skeptical over it being a refurb but it came in excellent condition! The only cosmetic damage is a very small scratch on the screen which is invisible unless you’re really inspecting the screen.The battery life on this phone so far has been pretty amazing. I use my phone a lot at home and especially for work, the battery lasted almost 2 full days???? Not sure if that’s because it’s so new but either way I’m happy.Having never owned an iPhone before I was nervous that I would absolutely hate the ui but I got used to it pretty quickly! I actually really really like this phone! The display is a much better resolution than the S10 even though the screen size is exactly the same. The audio seems to be much clearer as well.I also really love the unique color! The pictures of it really don’t do it justice. In the listing it looks like a light grayish lavender but in person it’s more saturated. I’ve only had it for 4 days and it’s already gotten lots of compliments!Overall I really really like this phone so far and I really have no complaints. I probably won’t be going back to Android :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great"

"Apple","iPhone 11","The first phone I received had a problem with the charging port so I sent it back and had no problems with the return at all and another phone was promptly sent with no questions asked. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came a day earlier than expected. Everything seems to function well. Kinda excited to use it. Came with no headphones, but I was aware of that. Already have airpods. So no worries. Looks really new and in good condition."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Hice la compra y al día siguiente ya tenia el teléfono en mis manos, admito que sentía cierta desconfianza pero esta compra definitivamente valió la pena, me llego un teléfono en perfecto estado, parece totalmente nuevo, ni un rayon ni ningún signo de uso, la batería estaba en 100%, instale la sim sin problemas, y siempre tuve la sensación de que compre un teléfono nuevo. Viene en una caja que no es del celular y su cargador tampoco es original, pero, el celular es como si estuviera nuevo, recomiendo esta compra, gracias vendedor!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","I’ll admit I was kinda skeptical about getting a phone from Amazon but I’m so glad I did! Knowing if anything is wrong or I’m not happy with my purchase I can return it. It’s a great phone and I’m glad I made the leap and did it. The batter life came at 89% which isn’t the best but not the worse! There was 1 very small scratch on the back but not noticeable at all. I have had no problems with it and very happy with my purchase"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Purchased Excellent condition from Kanga Supply. Your mileage may vary.Found no scratches at all - even with light shining from various angles. Phone passed basic testing apps. Unfortunately, battery life is at 80%; oh well, it's a lottery. Lasts long enough for student use.Have a case, screen and camera protector on. It's been about a week and haven't noticed any issues. So far very pleased.-About section- says, ""minimum battery capacity of 80%"" but the -renewed description- says, ""battery that exceeds 80% capacity"". Discrepancy between wording but phone was within one of them."
"Apple","iPhone 11","muy recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","This came 5 day earlier than expected. Yes it is really unlocked! So it was super easy to switch my device over using same sim card. Customer Service was also top notch. I thought I got a 256 but accidentally chose 128 which I decided to keep however they were VERY quick to respond and very willing to accommodate me. It was a gift for my son and both he and I have zero comolaints so far"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Apple phones are always a great phone his phones have a 90 day return policy which I think is very important for a phone the battery life though is not the best but the screen functionality is pretty well and it also has Face ID that works great and the best part about it is that on a regular phone when you run out of storage it starts going slow but Apple even when you run out of storage but even before you get to iCloud the phone does not run slow so I always love the Apple so I do recommend it so even though it’s much newer models out there told your phone still works good I just keep in mind though that not all of them the battery life is amazing which I find is a very important to mention"
"Apple","iPhone 11","husband loves it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone is very good! I had an issue with my charger but it was solved professionally. Will buy from them again"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone itself is good. There’s a few small scratches on the edge of the screen, and the battery life was 91%. Very worth the discount of a refurbished phone in that regard. However, the phone came locked. I was able to use the phones IMEI number to look up what carrier it was locked under. Which ended up being a C Spire?? (Never heard of them) And I was able to go to their website and use the phones serial and IMEI numbers to unlock the phone. I was very frustrated however since this was supposed to be an UNLOCKED phone. And if you didn’t know how to do the unlocking process and/or your phone was locked under a different carrier I don’t know that you would be able to unlock it….like I said, the condition of the phone is worth it. But BUYER BEWARE! You won’t know for sure that you’re receiving an unlocked phone until you’re holding it in your hands!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got for my daughters birthday. So far so good. No scratches or any damage shown. Everything works as it should!"

"Apple","iPhone 11","Not only amazing iPhones, but also excellent humans, this is very recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusto mucho buena inversión"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Works wonderfull I’m glad I per chase it"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo llegó en muy buenas condiciones (Aunque la caja exterior estaba muy maltratada) y para mí suerte fuera de un par de golpecitos en las orillas, la batería me llego al 100 y la calidad de la cámara es excelente como se en la foto del cachorro."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buenas noches, sinceramente muy recomendado, llegó al 100, estética 99, solo un muy pequeño rayón atrás, la pantalla al 100, la batería al 100, cuando te lo mandan te mandan una clave para que esa clave se la des al de la paquetería, eso sí , me comentó el repartidor que hay que checar al momento el producto por qué a una persona no le llegó nada que por eso el al momento me pidió que se checara para que se viera que está el producto, esperó que les sirva mi resumen, saludos desde Córdoba Veracruz, viva México"
"Apple","iPhone 11","En general el celular funciona muy bien, llevo con el 3 meses y hasta ahora todo funciona perfectamente, en estética el celular tenía unos pequeños rayones en la pantalla pero nada que afecte y para verlos lo debes de ver a detalle, en el día a día no se notan, la condición de la batería me llego al 87, cosa que hasta ahora después de 3 meses sigue igual."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Batería al 79"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bueno para ser un celular reacondicionado, llego en un buen estado y funciona bien.

Un detalle a considerar es la batería, que está a capacidad máxima de 82%
Venia con algunos raspones pequeñitos y para meter la tarjeta sim batalle a pesar que viene con llave."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó con el 83% de batería y esta funcionando bien. Físicamente el teléfono está súper bien, no tiene ni un solo detalle y eso me gustó. La cajita en la que te lo mandan es genérica pero lo importante es el contenido. Finalmente lo que no me gustó fue que el cargador que te mandan es genérico y no estoy muy segura de qué tan bueno sea cargarlo con menos watts de lo que indica el cargador original, me habría gustado que por lo menos tuviera el cable original. Pero de ahí en fuera todo cool, si lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","En general, fue una buena compra! Lo recomiendo

El precio adecuado y tuve la suerte de que llegara con batería al 100%. Todo funciona de maravilla y no tuve ningún problema para configurarlo, viene desbloqueado tal cual la descripción. El cargador cumple, sin ser espléndido.

Unas por otras... Así como la batería venía al 100%, desafortunadamente la pantalla y la parte posterior están muy rayadas. El protector de pantalla que tenía instalado no era muy bueno, así que se lo cambié por una mica de hidrogel. La parte posterior no tenía protección, así que yo le puse una mica de hidrogel. Los rayones son bastante visibles (me disculpo por no mostrarlo bien por las micas).

Por el precio y la experiencia de usuario, me parece una buena compra y ya con micas instaladas los rayones pasan prácticamente desapercibidos."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó el teléfono a los 2 días.
Tiene como 2 rayones imperceptibles , con batería al 87% y funciona perfecto.
Recomiendo la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Apenas llevo 3 meses con el teléfono, pero hasta ahorita todo bien, no falla nada. Estoy muy contento con la compra. Estéticamente el teléfono muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Vino perfecto a los 4 días de pedirlo
Llegó con el 87% de vida, la pantalla trae mica de cristal ya puesta intacta, sin ningún rayón. Fue buena compra. Recomiendo al vendedor (ojo, no son nuevos, son Rea condicionados y trae cargador genérico pero no tengo ningún problema."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego con detalles menores en la estetica, la batería venia en un 89% y no tuvo ningún problema. El único detalle es que el cargador que me enviaron no funcionaba, de ahí en mas fue una compra muy buena."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego en perfecto estado con caja y cargador y batería 94%
Lo súper recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llegó excelente. Sin ningún rayón en la pantalla, parte trasera u orillas. Llegó con 100% de condición de batería y se actualizó a iOS 16 después de la primera configuración."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó literal como nuevo no tiene ningún rayón ni golpe, con 100% capacidad de la batería, la caja y el cargador que son genéricos, traía un plástico protector y también venía con el glass puesto, recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono llegó el día que me decían, llegó muy bien empaquetado y su cargador sin detalles , el único detalle que note es en la esquina inferior que no afecta en su función, cámaras, sonido, vibración, la batalla true ton, todo bien hasta ahora, la condición de batería me llegó al 83% nada mal espero me dure al menos una carga al día, pero satisfechos porqué me llegó en buen estado y com la garantía que prometen de 90 días."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compre por qué tengo más de 5 años que pase de iOS a Android y quería probar sin gastar tanto que tal me iba regresando a la manzana. Como era de esperarse la experiencia bastante buena con iOS, intuitivo, ágil y muy bien depurado (no como mi Xioami y su muy mala interfaze MIUI llena de bugs, que fue básicamente lo que me hizo volver a voltear a iPhone).

Por otra parte este iPhone reacondicionado llegó con una estética casi perfecta, solo un rayon en la pantalla que no era muy visible a simple vista. El gran problema fue la capacidad máxima de la batería, como muestro en las fotos del 77%, y en las especificaciones de Amazon renewed dice que debe ser un mínimo de 80%. Además que en lo personal siento que el touch quedaba a deber, senti que tenía un lag. Termine haciendo la devolución por el tema de la pila y el touch, cero problemas y excelente atención por parte del vendedor TELMOV. Lo recomiendo: SI, pero igual busquen un renewed las reciente, espero les sirva mi reseña y fotos."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ligeramente raspado pero justo lo que se promete"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Maybe I’m just a bad photographer, but I went from a single lens iPhone 7 camera to this 2 lens one and don’t find the quality of the photos much different."
"Apple","iPhone 11","estética 10 de 10 , la batería al 95% , el precio es lo que mas me gusto ;)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto llegó con lo que promete, un empaque sencillo, con la garantía, el cargador y cable tipo Lightning y por supuesto el iPhone, que está sin un sólo rasguño, cuenta con todas las funciones y especificaciones elegidas, Face ID, True Tone, desbloqueado para cualquier compañía y con una mica protectora de buena calidad. Contento con la compra, volvería a hacerla."
"Apple","iPhone 11","De maravilla todo, el cargador era genérico, pero de ahí en más me gustó todo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es la primera vez que compro un iPhone renovado. Una estética de 8.5 podría decir… no tiene rayones en la parte trasera ni en las orillas pero sí en casi toda la pantalla, como 3 que sí se notan un poco y los demás los ves cuando los observas detalladamente pero con una mica de hidrogel ya no se nota, encontré el primer defecto en el cargador, resulta que el cubo ya no funcionaba desde el primer intento por cargarlo, y por ultimo la batería que me llego con un 88%, me llego el lunes 29 de noviembre y hoy 2 de diciembre la batería bajo a 87%… a lo mejor ya le tocaba bajar pero lo tendré en observación y cuidare de la batería, si llega a bajar más en poco tiempo creo que lo devolveré. 😐"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The local Phone outlet at the mall wanted more for the same phone. And I had to go in and listen to their sales pitch. No thanks.Very good condition. Very few marks. Battery is excellent. Like anything refurbished, you can do well or you can do poor.This was a good deal all around for the price."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buen artículo, buen precio, solo que la vida de la batería está en 80%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto es prácticamente bueno, me llegó hace 2 días y funciona sin problema, me llego con 85% de batería. Cabe resaltar que si venía un poco raspado de las esquinas y de la parte de atrás tiene marcas de una funda que no se pueden quitar, y de las 2 bocinas de la parte de abajo solamente funciona 1, era de esperarse pues el producto no es nuevo, pero no afecta su funcionamiento, incluso así se sigue escuchando bien, en cuanto a lo demás funciona perfecto Face ID al 100 y todas las cámaras de igual forma, en cuanto a la batería me dura aproximadamente unas 8hrs de uso normal. En conclusión he leído otras comentarios y es una moneda al aire el comprar esto, tanto te puede salir bueno o malo, cuestión de suerte, en mi caso me gusto el producto y si pienso quedármelo hasta el momento funciona bien, actualizare la reseña si algo sale mal posteriormente, recomiendo comprarlo solo si no eres tan exigente y no tienes los recursos para comprarlo, si los tienes 1000 veces mejor que te lo compres nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono venía estéticamente nuevo, por la excepción de la pantalla rayada y con una mica para equilibrarlo, sinembargo al encenderlo la persona para quien era (era un regalo) se percató de que en la ezquina superior derecha tenía una mancha muy notable de humedad lo cual no debería pasar si el celular tiene IP68; lo revisé y ya había sido abierto. No tenía residuos de pegamento en la tapa trasera, en bordes. Pensamos que alguien lo compró nuevo, le cambió la pantalla por la suya que estaba dañada y lo regresó, entrando como renewed. No entiendo como amazon vende esos pedidos ""revisados por sus técnicos de calidad"" pero bueno, se devolvió sólo por eso. En sí el celular era un 9 sin ese detalle que sí era muy notorio."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The IPhone was exactly what I was looking for. It transferred everything over easily and was ready to use. Has a lot of storage, which is what was needed. Pictures are amazing. Love everything about it. Went from an IPhone 6 to the IPhone 11, big step up but worth the money.Thank You."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono se encuentra en perfectas condiciones. Lo recibí con capacidad de bateria al 86%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto parece nuevo, batería al 100% y con garantía en el móvil hasta el siguiente año.Excelente producto, volvería a comprar con el vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo unico que no me gusta es que la bateria se baja rapido."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo como estaba anunciado el celular llegó viendoce casi nuevo en muy buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Cuando me llego el celular estuve súper feliz ya que me llego impecable, sin raspones, ni golpes, la batería me llego con 96% practicando como nuevo, sin embargo no venia completo ya que no traía la bandeja de la tarjeta SIM, mientras no puedo usar por completo el celular ya que no puedo ponerle Sim en lo que consigo la bandeja:("
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esta bastante bien lo único malo que tiene dos pequeñitos rayones de lo demás esta bastante bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llegó con cargador y cable genérico. La estética es de 9/10, con marcas mínimas de uso. Llevé el equipo a una Apple Store para que le hicieran un diagnóstico integral y solo tuvo alerta en 2 componentes los cuales me especificaron que podían resolverse con la actualización del iOS. Bateria al 86% de vida útil después de cerca de 800 ciclos de carga. Para un equipo ""renovado"" o de uso, creo que es aceptable y funcional.Conforme lo vaya probando, actualizaré si algo cambia."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto llego en buen estado, golpes mínimos pero que no impiden la funcionalidad del producto.Llego con una batería del 86%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo único que no me gustó es que llegó con la bateria al 86, está dentro del rango esperado pero esperaba tener suerte. Después de usarlo unos meses bajó muy rápido hasta 75 :("
"Apple","iPhone 11","Calidad y precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Batería al 83%, pantalla con 3 pequeños rayones, todo lo de más funciona bien hasta ahora."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Está en excelentes condiciones pero me llegó con cargador tipo C cuando el que necesitan los iPhone es de entrada Lightning 🙃"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me gusto que salió defectuosa una bosina de la parte de abajo y se escuchaba muy feo las otras , pero no lo regrese por que ya lo necesitaba"
"Apple","iPhone 11","me llegó bien de estetica, solo que cuando lo prendimos llegó con el 80% de batería del equipo, para in iphone ese porcentaje de vida es muy poco, más relacionado al precio. Si deberían verificar antes las baterias."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Received a refurbished iPhone 11 in great condition for half the price of new! I'll definitely.buy another Phone from this supplier."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Un buen regalo para mi hijo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","es muy bueno y no me vino rayado ni nada"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Primero busque exactamente qué vendedor de todos los disponibles era el que tenía mejores reviews en los últimos meses y días, posteriormente determine que el mejor era BuySPRY. El teléfono me llegó impecable, batería al 100%, sin detalles estéticos, sin problemas como el de pantalla no reconocida, bloqueo por iCloud o reconocimiento de la Sim, aunque no era una caja original evidentemente, aún y así la caja era de buena calidad, te viene un cargador genérico y un cable usb a Lightning, además de que ya el celular viene con una mica de cristal (solo tuve que comprarle una funda, transparente y listo)Estoy muy satisfecho con este celular de hecho es mi primer iPhone, le quise dar una oportunidad ya que adquirí un iPad en diciembre y me gusto mucho su sistema, eso mismo me hizo adquirir unos AirPods 3, y la integración esta a otro nivel, verdaderamente no hay nada en Android que se le pueda comparar al ecosistema IOS.Totalmente recomendado si dudas en que un iPhone 11 a pesar detener sus años sigue siendo un buen equipo por el procesador y las cámaras mantiene una buena relación precio-calidad gracias a entrar como producto renovado. No lo dudes y anímate"

 El vendedor fue “BuySPRY”, el iphone me llegó en muy buenas condiciones estéticamente hablando de la parte de atrás junto con las esquinas, sin embargo la PANTALLA ESTABA TODA RALLADA. El celular venía con una mica de cristal ya puesta, para despistar los rallones, pero de igual manera se notaba bastante, y me daba miedo quitárselas por otra reseña que lei donde la pantalla estaba peor que la mia, por ende decidí comenzar el proceso de devolución (aunque lo voy a volver a comprar aqui en amazon porque esta a un precio nut razonable pero de otro vendedor). Además el iphone llegó con un 80% de porcentaje de bateria, lo utilicé por tres dias y bajo a 79%, la pila me duro alrededor de 10 horas de uso constante en redes sociales. Fuera de la pantalla y la pila, todo funcionaba excelente, por otra parte me dieron un cargador genérico de carga rápida que cargaba mas veloz que mi cargador original de apple."

"Apple","iPhone 11","Telefono de gama alta y buen funcionamiento"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It's cheap and not bad."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I thought “refurbished” meant they at least replaced the battery but it just looks like they just reset someone’s old phone to resell it. Honestly should’ve spent the extra money to get an actual new one. Battery quality is at 89% and the first thing I noticed when unwrapping the phone is the scratch on the back. I thought I was getting a deal but I’m disappointed to have gifted this and not be able to reach them because the “like new” phone can’t hold a charge.

I would prefer a full refund and would purchase brand new from apple, but I think they only do credit.
Refurbished is new to me so I’m not sure what qualifies, so I’ll also mention that it came with a non apple charging cord and adapter and in bubble wrap and white boxes. No original packaging, phone looks used, and battery was used."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular muy bien con unos rayones en la pantalla que se notaban de muy cerca apenas, lo que me disgusto fue la salud de la bateria ya que venia en 78%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó a los 2 días.
Tiene solo 2 rayones que casi no se ven.
La batería llegó con 94% y funciona perfecto.
Recomiendo la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego antes de lo esperado.,al 100 salud de batería.,sin rayones ni marcas..prácticamente como nuevo y funcional en todo,faceid,cámaras.,altavoz..
Bocinas etc .. muy satisfecho con la compra
Tuve mucha suerte considero que me llego un equipo nuevecito .."
"Apple","iPhone 11","En la descripción garantizan que el equipo tiene una capacidad de batería mayor al 80%, pues este que he comprado tiene el 75%, menos mal que puedes devolverlo. A escepcion de un rayón en la pantalla la a estética del celular y otras características están perfectas parecía nuevo con la simple estética a e"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Para ser re acondicionado esta súper… Batería al 89%, me llegó mucho antes de la fecha estimada y el producto cero rayones, totalmente satisfecha con la compra, calidad precio totalmente justo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El dispositivo llegó como nuevo. Excelente presentación. Buenos detalles extra como cargador, cable y mica protectora de pantalla."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Realmente un equipo nuevo aunque sea reacondicionado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó mucho antes de lo que se específico y muy bien embalado. Tiene pequeños rayones de uso, lo cual es normal en un telefono renovado, pero funciona bien, ya conecte mi smartwatch y auriculares bluetooth de marca Soundpeats y funcionan a la perfección. Tuve un detalle con la actualización inicial de las apps, pero con un Restablecimiento completo del teléfono fue suficiente y hasta el momento esta funcionando de maravilla.

Actualizare la reseña dentro de unos 3 meses."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular me llegó con 81% de batería, esto quiere decir que en poco tiempo de uso será necesario hacer un cambio de batería urgente (Esto para evitar los bajones bruscos de batería utilizando el equipo) Por ejemplo, use el equipo un día y del 26% de batería paso a 10% y después al 6% y se apagó.El equipo también se sobrecalentó en repetidas ocasiones, la pantalla venia rayada.Creo que por el precio no vale la pena."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Highly recommend the seller. Phone arrived in excellent condition. It looks just like a brand-new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It came looking brand new with a new charger and was packaged neatly. The battery health is 90% which is good. My only problem with it, is that the front camera lens has tiny scratches but the camera is still clear and good and better with some lighting. Overall it's worth your money."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo me ha encantado de este iPhone 11 amarillo! Llegó a tiempo, buen producto, tenía un raspón pero chiquitito pero nada que le afectara al funcionamiento y prácticamente invisible con la mica, la pila en 85% pero no es nuevo así que sin quejas y ya llevo varios meses con celular y sigo fascinada con la compra, vendedor verificado, comprobado y lo más seguro es que seguiré comprando con él o ella :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","ESTOY TENIENDO PROBLEMAS CON LAS COMPRAS EN AMAZON COMO ESTA QUE LO ANUNCIAN COMPLETAMENTE DESBLOQUEADO Y ESTA BLOQUEADO LO TENGO EN EL TALLER DE MI PROBEDOR PARA QUE LO DESBLOQUEEN Y ME VA A COSTAR MIL PESOS"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego sin ningún detalle, con el 100% de batería, un muy buen teléfono"
"Apple","iPhone 11","compre este producto por el precio y por lo mismo no esperaba mas, tiene algunos detalles estéticos pero no son visibles a simple vista y la batería viene debajo del 80%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó muy bien, un pequeño raspón en una esquina pero casi no se ve y también llegó con una mica de cristal, la pila al 85% todo muy bien, cámara, bloqueo facial, se puede usar con cualquier compañía celular, muy buena compra recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono llegó en muy buenas condicionesLa pila está en un 87%, le cambiaron la pantalla completamente y en la sección ajustes no la reconoce como producto originalPero el teléfono jala a la perfección, viene sin rayones, súper cuidado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó a tiempo, muy bien cuidado, sin rayones, la batería con más del 80%. Solo con un pequeño detalle en el botón de desactivar/activar timbre pero por lo demás funciona al 100."
"Apple","iPhone 11","De acuerdo al modelo que compre, el precio me pareció muy bien, el equipo llegó en perfecto estado, con la batería al 100%, llevo casi 1 semana y no ha fallado, todo le funciona bien, lo pude vincular sin problema con mi Apple Watch ⌚️, trae un cargador y cable genérico como lo indica en la descripción así como una caja no original, pero viene bien empaquetado, creo que es cuestión de suerte, yo me arriesgue y recibe un producto 98% nuevo ☺️"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Got the iPhone the other day, it only last about 2 hours on a full charge. IOS states battery is needing to be serviced."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El paquete llegó en tiempo, muy bien empacado, trae su cargador y cable genérico que funcionan correctamente, el teléfono llegó sin marcas, golpes o rayones en la parte trasera, bordes y lentes de las cámaras, la condición de pila es 89%, funciona sin problemas, Face ID correcto, True Tone correcto, cámaras funcionan bien, sonido y vibración también funcionan, esta desbloqueado, los botones en buen estado, el único detalle es que tiene varios rayones el la pantalla, que van mas allá del desgaste normal de un equipo y si son visibles a un brazo de distancia, se le puso una mica y prácticamente no se ven, a excepción de uno en el centro de la pantalla, decidí quedármelo, pensando que al cambiar puede llegar otro con más detalles.y además me urgía el equipo, sin embargo es de tomar en cuenta que los equipos si tienen detalles de uso y son visibles, dan más la impresión de ser usados a ser reacondicionados, se espera que los productos tengan señales de uso pero no con signos de maltrato, considero que Amazon debería mejorar el control de calidad de sus proveedores en estos productos"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo estuvo bien la entrega rápida antes de tiempo bien empaquetado y bien el producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great quality, works perfectly and tons of storage."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto llegó y viene como mencionan con un porcentaje de pila de 80, y algunos detallas estéticos, estaré pendiente por algún detalle, de momento todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tiene una estética de 9/10 (tiene rasguños muy leves que no afectan al funcionamiento del teléfono) aunque la batería llegó con un 86% de condición de batería me hubiese gustado que llegara con más."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Al igual que muchos tenía mis dudas con si comprar o no el equipo.Mis primeras impresiones de la estética del teléfono es un 7/10, tiene 2 detalles en la pantalla, no afecta el funcionamiento, pero como en las compras que vi las tapan con una mica de cristal.Además de esto tiene detalles en los bordes, los cuales sí son aceptables dado que es un equipo renovado.En cuestión del porcentaje de batería me llegó con 83%.En funcionamiento cumple muy bien, Apps, descarga, señal, video, sonido etc.Otro punto bueno es que el equipo viene liberado.Estaré actualizando en base a mi experiencia dado que a pesar que un 83% es regular, seguiré dándole un uso normal, espero no tener que regresarlo, pero todo puede pasar."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Para el precio está bien , aunque me hubiera gustado un poco más de porcentaje de vida de la batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","En general cumple con lo que dice, aunque un lente venia estrellado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Al ser equipos refurbished puedes tener suerte o no. En mi caso una cámara no funciona y llevo más de una semana intentando ponerme en contacto con el equipo para hacer válida la garantía. Compré en Amazon pensando que sería más fácil el proceso (en caso de requerir) pero no es así. Tengan en cuanta."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Excelente estado del celular y la batería estaba en increíble condiciones, se que es restaurado únicamente por qué así lo menciona el artículo. La calidad del producto fue muy buena."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono viene muy bien de estética , la pila viene al 85 porciento , cosa que esperaba por ser usado pero llegó dañado de la bocina , no funciona, ni escucho ni me escuchan al hablar !"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego en muy buen estado y funciona a la perfección, lo unico malo es que la pila llego con un 73% de capacidad de carga. Cuando termine la garantia del telefono, se la cambiaré. Sigue siendo una buena compra, pero no excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono trae un cristal templado, el cual oculta la pantalla que está totalmente rayada, llego con 85 por ciento de vida de batería, fuera de eso todo excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó a tiempo, súper bien empacado, en perfecto estado, llevo más o menos una semana con él. Llegó con el 81% de batería, eso sería definitivamente lo único malo, sin embargo el teléfono funciona a la perfección."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo venia muy bien protegido y la bateria esta arriba del 95%, de estetica esta de 10."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Very pleased with the product and speed of delivery. Happy customer"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compre para mi hija, llego a tiempo y un año después un súper celular"
"Apple","iPhone 11","It is exactly what I expected"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me encantó"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo muy bien el product y el precio nos encanto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Yo tenía mucho miedo de comprar un teléfono reacondicionado, desde hace tiempo había checado los iPhone y leía todas las reseñas y veía todas las fotos, temerosa y todo decidí comprarlo Y NO SABEN QUÉ BUENA DECISIÓN, venía en caja genérica, lo prendí y lo primero que chequé fue la pila no podía creerlo cuando vi que la traía al 100, la pantalla cero rayada, todo funcionando al 100. Lo único que me asustó fue que al principio no descargaba nada de la app store pero lo reinicié y empezó a jalar super bien. De verdad que es como si lo hubiera comprado como nuevo, todo funciona súper bien, cámara, flash, bluetooth, micrófono, todo todo todo, ni un solo rayón debajo de la mica. Hay que tomar en cuenta que el cargador igual es genérico pero funciona muy bien y todo perfecto por unos 5mil pesos menos (lo compré en 8200) SÚPER COMPRA"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó bien, trae 2 rasponcitos pero todo bie"
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far, I can't complain. I can live with the 91% battery health. I bought the 256GB Product Red iPhone 11 for the storage of my photos and videos."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Después de batallar con dos compras, el primero nunca llegó (me reembolsaron a tarjeta de regalo sin problema), el segundo no era funcional pues al abrirlo para reacondicionarlo y pegarlo de nuevo pegaron en donde entra el SIM y no se podía colocar (lo regrese y sembomsaron a tarjeta) ahora para ocupar ese saldo lo adquirí y funciona bien, la batería esta bien, llego a tiempo pero, tiene bastantes detalles, el Led de flash está roto, tiene un golpe en una esquina y presenta múltiples rayones, a diferencia de otros artículos reacondiicoados este es el peor en estética pero al menos llego y si funciona, decidí ya no reclamar pues era un regalo y con la funda no se nota y al final lo que necesitaba eran las funciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Great quality product.The customer service is fast and professional."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Este producto lo recomiendo muchísimo, mi teléfono lo compré hace 3 meses y quería escribir una reseña después de este tiempo, no tiene una patinada de mosca y el sistema está excelente la pila me llego del 96% lo cual me pareció muy buena por el precio y no tengo ninguna queja hast el momento"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó a tiempo y en buenas condiciones, solo tiene un pequeño raspón en la parte de abajo. La salud de la batería en 90% y funciona bien en todos los aspectos. El cuadrito del cargador no funcionaba, pero el cable si, aunque no fue realmente un problema para mi"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Comprar un celular de este tipo siempre es una lotería, no sabes si te tocará uno bueno o algo que no vale la pena. En mi caso me llegó el celular en perfectas condiciones y después de 3 semanas de uso no tengo ninguna queja en ningún sentido. Lo único es que me llegó con 85% de vida útil de batería pero está por arriba de lo mínimo que debe llegarte (80). De todos modos la duración de la pila rinde bien.Suerte con sus compras."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compré en Mayo, hoy en noviembre me saltó la notificación de que mi batería necesita mantenimiento. Llegó con 90% y ahora tiene 75%. Si notaba que tardaba más tiempo en cargar pero pensaba que era mi cargador. Ahoren mil pesos más y compren uno nuevo con garantía! el cambio de bateria sale casi al doble"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La condición de batería fue inferior a la que me esperaba. Me llegó en 83%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es el producto que promete, tiene 88% de vida de bateria, loq eu me parece aceptable por el precio que fue inferior a 10,000. No tiene raspones ni se ve muy usado, le daría un 9.5 a la estética de la carcasa y a la pantalla un 10, sin duda. No le pongo 5 estrellas porque mi línea es mexicana con BAIT (parte de Altán Redes) y no fue compatible, por lo que tuve que cambiarme a otra con menos Gigas de datos al mes. En fin, no fue mucha la diferencia para poder usar un iPhone 11. De igual forma facturaron sin problemas."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El celular llegó en buen estado, tiene varias marcas en la pantalla muy ligeras, la batería al 85%, el cargador es genérico pero funciona perfecto todo el equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","llegó en buen estado e incluso llegó con una mica. el único defecto que le he notado después de una semana casi dos de uso es que siento el micrófono es muy “sensible”los audios o las llamadas que llego hacer, parece que estoy hablando muy fuerte o a un tono moderado cuando incluso estoy susurrando.fuera de eso, todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono impecable, como nuevo, hasta el momento excelente, tengo con él un mes."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Batterie life was at 86%, which is fair since it was in the description. Like new, very good very good"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Gracias a la empresa Amazon por respaldar a los proveedores de equipos reacondicionados. Para mi es una garantía que Amazon los avale. El equipo llegó como nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llevo un poco más del mes con el iPhone y mi opinión tras es el uso es que llegó en buenas condiciones, estéticamente 9.5, tiene unos ligeros rayones en la pantalla y en la parte trasera marcas de uso de funda, pero aun así no es nada grave o que se note demasiado. En cuestión de la batería llegó con 91% de condición por lo que no está nada mal, en el tiempo que llevo con el todo le ha funcionado y no he tenido ningún problema , Face ID, llamadas y mensajes, cámaras, batería, no tiene pantalla genérica por lo que cheque, GPS, BT , todo bien, lo único que comentaría es que NO ESTA TOTALMENTE DESBLOQUEADO DE COMPAÑÍA como se dice, yo usaba mi compañía telefónica Bait y a la hora de insertar la SIM no la leyó, hasta que probé con Telcel y Movistar funcionó, tuve que cambiar de compañía para hacer uso del Celular que para mí no fue gran problema, pero se comenta por qué al menos el que me enviaron no era para cualquier compañía."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo está perfecto, solo el altavoz no funciona, me quedo con una mala experiencia sobre ese tipo de compra, probablemente no la repita :( confíe demasiado en Amazon :("
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego sin detalles me llego 10/10 y la batería en 87% la verdad para el año que es el cel se me hizo muy bien la verdad 100% recomendado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Si no fuera por la bateria que viene al 80 %, estuviera perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Batería al 85%, hasta el momento no ha presentado ninguna falla y funciona al 100, solo la cámara no tiene tan buena definición pero eso creo es del modelo en sí."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo se recibió muy buen empacado y protegido, es prácticamente nuevo solo detalles mínimos en el marco de las cámaras, (ver foto anexa). Les actualizaré en cuanto a funcionalidad unas semana más, ya que apenas lo recibí ayer y hoy lo activé."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto tiene rayones en la pantalla que se ven a 3 brazos de distancia (no a 1 como lo describen), la limpieza en la bocina para escuchar, parece que esta sucia y he tenido algunos problemas con el WiFi del equipo (de pronto pierde la señal y ya no se conecta).Por la parte trasera esta impecable, al igual que en los contornos.La capacidad de la bateria, esta al 84% (ya algo bajo y pronto requerira el cambio).El cargador y el cable genericos, funcionan bien.Voy a seguir probando el tema del WiFi y si sigue fallando, voy a tener que delvolverlo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo bueno: llegó en menos de 24 hrs.Lo excelente: el estado físico en general del equipo, parece nuevo.Lo No Tan Bueno (malo): Salud de batería en 85% y cargador y cable de dudosa calidad, dudo que sean MFI."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La verdad yo dudaba mucho en comprar un celular Reacondicionado por las múltiples reseñas con malas experiencias; aún así como bien se ha dicho, al realizar una compra de este estilo es una jugada riesgosa. Sin embargo, yo he quedado absolutamente satisfecho con la compra y sumamente agradecido con el vendedor.El teléfono llegó en un día. Las condiciones estéticas son de verdad impresionantes ya que muestra únicamente mínimos detalles estéticos que sólo al verlo minuciosamente se han de notar. Realmente parece totalmente nuevo, ya que llegó con el 88% de condición de batería. Estaba perfectamente embalado y hasta con plásticos para proteger el teléfono; incluso ya viene con mica protectora de cristal templado en la pantalla.De verdad puedo decir que han sido de las mejores compras que he hecho y he de reiterar estoy sumamente agradecido con el vendedor por tan excelente experiencia de compra.Ahora solo falta ver si en las próximas semanas presenta alguna falla por lo que estaré actualizando esta reseña conforme lo voy usando."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El precio parece bueno, pero no lo es, puedes encontrar telefonos en mejor estado en grupos de ventas, mix up o en facebook, el costo es elevado, tienen poco tiempo de garantía, en mi caso la pantalla vino muy rayada, algunos muy profundos. La batería viene muy bien, con 93% de maxima capacidad.No es del todo malo, es de suerte ya que los equipos salen de bodegas de amazon (pregunte) puede que te toque uno genial o no, no creo que valga la pena el riesgo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo muy bien con el producto, mi única queja es con el envío me prometieron una fecha y llego tres días después, pero todo lo demás al 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono llego sin ninguna raya en la pantalla o en el cristal trasero, llego con 95% de bateria.Lo unico que ya no nos gustó fue que los cables y el adaptador son genéricos, no son originales."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tengo ya un par de meses con el teléfono y está al 100, literalmente. Venía con el 100% de vida de batería, empacado como si fuese nuevo y con cargador genérico (este último se me descompuso al mes lo cuál es comprensible). Estéticamente está 9.8/10 por un pequeño detalle en la esquina que sinceramente es imperceptible. Si aún estás indeciso si comprar un re acondicionado, este es el comentario que esperabas."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El telefono llego bien cuidado, desbloqueado, la bateria al 86% 128gb, face id, camaras, sin rasguños, casi nuevo. Lo tuve que devolver porque la mayoria de pantallas de los iPhones 11 salen defectuosas, tienen ese color amarillento que no se quita desactivando el true tone ni el night shift, ni siquiera cambiandole la matiz de colores, no soy el unico veo que sucede tambien con el mas nuevo, el iPhone 12 pro, max y mini tambien, siendo totalmente nuevos!. investigue y son muchisimos usuarios que detectan este problema y los devuelven a la propia Apple, en definitiva han disminuido su control de calidad los iPhones, siendo aun nuevos , sus pantallas salen defectuosas, no todas algunas pantallas si salen con colores reales, tengo otro iPhone que tengo mas antiguo y se ve mucho mejor su pantalla que el 11 siendo original, cheque reseñas y videos y hay muchas pruebas que este defecto de pantalla es de fabrica, hasta la pantallas de los iPhones 7,6,5 se ven mejores. Hay X y XS que tienen mejores pantallas que los mas nuevos pero es practicamente suerte que te toque una buena pantalla con colores reales. Tengo in iPad lo compare y no se ve amarilla, se ve real, el blanco se ve blanco no amarillo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó en excelentes condiciones, sólo un pequeño raspón en la parte de abajo que no se nota. Funciona de maravilla."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Belle qualité, arrivé dans les délais,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo me llego en tiempo y forma como correnpondia. El detalle es que me llego con falla en la bateria. Espero que el proveedor me haga la garantia del equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","RECOMIENDO a BUYSPRY ya que me respondió súper rápido mis dudas antes de comprar, el equipo tal cual como lo describe. MUCHAS GRACIAS BUYSPRY!!! Pronto te compraré otros iPhone 😌"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Al principio tenía muchas dudas sobre comprar este teléfono o no. Vi algunas críticas malas hacia éste y me ponían en duda. Sin embargo, lo compre y al siguiente día ya me lo habían entregado. Entre lo primero que quise ver fue la batería ya que muchos mencionaban que venía de 80 a 90 de capacidad y el teléfono que me llegó la trae del 100%.En cuanto a la estética le doy un 8/10, ya que tiene algunos detalles en la parte superior e inferior pero nada que me moleste (al menos a mí) y en la parte de atrás se ven apenas unos rayones, nada de qué preocuparse.Quedo satisfecho con la compra. Lo estaré probando por varios meses y si detectó algo raro lo publicaré.Pd. El face ID jala bien, la cámara igual y en las pocas horas que llevo de uso no se me ha trabado.Actualización: llevo dos semanas de uso y el teléfono se ha comportado a la perfección. La batería me dura un día y medio con uso moderado (sólo uso redes sociales y de vez en cuando veo algún video). También en cuanto a la carga creo que está bien. Lo pongo a cargar cuando está entre 15% y 20% y normalmente se carga en hora y media.Seguiré reportando camaradas!De momento recomiendo ampliamente a este vendendor ya que igual compré un iPhone X y tampoco ha tenido fallas e incluso llegó con estética de 10 y batería al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto llegó muy rápido, bien empaquetado, no encontré la llave para la sim, llegó con cargador y cable(genéricos pero funcionales) sin embargo después de cargar el equipo y probarlo en el día me percate de un defecto en la pantalla y tuve que devolver lo, el precio me parecía aceptable, ya había comprado este tipo de equipos ""refurbished"" y no había tenido problemas, espero encontrar otro equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Decidí regresarlo y ordenar uno nuevo, venia muy rayada la pantalla, al parecer es de suerte que te toque uno en buen estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Pues en la cámara aparecen unas Manchitas y falla al momento de conectarse a la red después de estar varias horas en el wifi de lo demás Todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gustó el equipo, está en muy buenas condiciones solo tiene un golpe muy leve en una esquina y está algo rayada la pantalla pero pasa desapercibida. Pongo un 4 porque me llegó con 87% de condición en batería lo cual me hubiera gustado que fuera mejor peor igual es un rendimiento aceptable. Si recomiendo la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La pantalla tiene talloncito la pila tiene 86%La bocina de llamadas se escucha muy bienEl altavoz si le subes mucho como que se quiere distorsionar pero no sé distorsiona, cuál quier cosa está la garantía, hera un regalo y le encanto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo estuvo bien pero traía un rayón grande y profundo en la pantalla que no venía en la descripción"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El articulo tenía buena estetica, pero al intentar actualizaro tuvimos problemas, no se podia activar facetime ni imessage, pero el principal problema es que la bateria venia deteriorada ya que su condicion era el del 75% por lo que el mismo equipo marcaba que estaba dañada, por este motivo decidi regresar el producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Si me gusto ,calidad de telefono precio justo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Justo lo que esperaba, estéticamente la calificación es de 9 ya que traía una ligera abolladura en el jack del cargador y ligeros raspones en la parte trasera del cristal, fuera de ello excelente. Ahora con el tema de la vida útil de la batería, el mínimo que asegura Amazon para sus productos es del 80%, en mi caso llego con 81% así que entra en ese rango, ubiera preferido mayor vida de la batería y es el motivo por el cuál pongo 4 estrellas. Es mi primera compra de equipos renewed y si lo recomiedo, además, si no es lo que esperabas puedes regresar el equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","The phone works well, good battery. One thing is the compass doesn't work, which I was not informed about when I purchased the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo me llegó rápido y en una apariencia muy bien cuidado, cero rayones. La capacidad de la pila si llego menos de 85% pero todo bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Adquirí el iphone 11 de 64 gbSolo que el auricular y una bocina estaban dañados. Tuve que solicitar devolución. De lo demás, funcionaba Perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo llego con una capacidad en batería de 99% lo cual me sorprendió bastante, pero venia muy rallado de la pantalla (esto no afecta el funcionamiento) pero creo que si hay que considerarlo al momento de realizar la compra, de lo demás no tenia ningún detalle y hasta el momento esta funcionando muy bien, el color morado es precioso y a pesar de que esta rallado yo estoy muy feliz con mi compra, si lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Bought this for a Christmas Gift. Works and looks great. I ordered a second one and they were three small pinhead scratches on the edges. There was a long scratch along the back but not bad. The Sim card tray was a little hard to get out. The phone itself works very good and for the price I can’t complain. I would have posted pictures but Amazon of course wants access to all your photos which they don’t need. What I purchase another phone if I had to? Yes"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Estéticamente muy bien, pero al momento de hacer una foto y usar en zoom aparece una mancha negra en la pantalla y en las fotos"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono venía en un estado 9/10 con batería al 82% , exelente compra,hasta ahora muy buena compra, ya veremos con el tiempo les actualizo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No puedes exigir mucho por el precio pero al menos no llego con fallas ni tantos daños estéticos"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Other than the battery issue the phone appears to be working properly. Battery error appeared shortly after I started using the phone stating the battery wasn't a genuine iphone battery. I contacted the seller and they did not respond in any meaningful way. Fortunately for me the error has disappeared just as mysteriously but I feel a battery is a pretty crucial component for a cell phone reflecting it's rating."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono llegó con problema de bluetooth (no se conecta), quise devolverlo pero no pude por no facturar (SIEMPRE FACTUREN), se dañó la pantalla, le siguió la cámara (nunca se me cayó)Una pena que vendan ese tipo de calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llevo casi un mes usándolo y hasta ahora funciona a la perfección!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Esteticamente esta hermoso llego con 81% de pila pero oh sorpresa al llamar no se escucha :( y al poner musica se oye horrible como que se tronaron las bocinas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Hola!! No venía la llave para la SIM. La pantalla viene rayada pero parece que todo lo demás funciona bien."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Es una vergüenza que vendan un producto con 79% de nivel de bateria"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Si vas comprar un producto reacondicionado no esperes un equipo perfecto.El vendedor ofrece un producto seminuevo.Me encanto mi compra, realmente es lo que esperaba, buena relación calidad precio."
"Apple","iPhone 11","No sirve face id deberían mencionarlo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","De estética 10/10, de batería tenia 86% (está dentro de lo aceptable) tengo una semana con el y sin problemas, lo recomiendo (ya viene con Mica en la pantalla)"

"Apple","iPhone 11","No foul."

"Apple","iPhone 11","I am so impressed with the amazing quality of the phone. Looks totally brand new and works as brand new.Would highly recommend this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Je n’ai pas reçu le Iphone 11 comme un neuf comme c’est inscrit dans les détails de ma commande. Il y a une petite tache blanche dans l’écran. De plus, sur la boite il est inscrit que la BP est a 84% alors que je viens tout juste d’ouvrir le téléphone et qu’il est a 82%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusto calidad precio"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen equipo es mi primer iPhone me llego en muy buen estado llevo usándolo 2 meses sin ningún problema La pila me llego con 88 no tengo problema me tarde todo el día completo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Se entrega con lo que dice la descripción, sin embargo tiene más detalles estéticos de lo que se menciona en la publicación. Es funcional completamente."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Solo el detalle en la pantalla, tiene una marca en el cristal, funcionamiento ok"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusta que nunca falla, todo funciona muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo llegó en tiempo, venía con su cargador genérico tal cual indica, a simple vista se ve cómo nuevo, no tiene golpes en los bordes ni nada, ligero rayón en la pantalla pero solo si prestas muchísima atención, la batería está al 84%, la cámara bien y la bocina también, por el momento todo me parece bien, precio considerable y a msi súper bien, el equipo me gusta mucho y no dudo en seguir poniéndolo a prueba.Si lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Prácticamente nuevo, sin ningún rayón, me vino con 100% de batería, anímense!!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buena experiencia en general. Llegó antes de lo estimado y el teléfono tiene muy buen aspecto, con rayoncitos casi imperceptibles pero con muy buen funcionamiento. Eso sí, cargador y caja genérica y batería al 86% de rendimiento, como se indica en la descripción. Sin embargo es una excelente opción para disfrutar de un iPhone a un precio mucho menor, contribuyendo a disminuir el desperdicio tecnológico al darle una segunda oportunidad a estos productos."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego muy bien, parece nuevo y todo funciona al 100"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El equipo se encuentra en un 90% fisicamente pero lo que no me gusto es que la bateria venia al 75% muy degrada, el auricular para escuchar se escucha bajo, lo demas pues se ve bien, esperemos que no presente alguna falla mas adelante. saludos."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó muy rápido la batería llego al 85% también lego rallado de la parte de atrás pero no se nota a simple vista como lo dejaron indicado y llego con unas marcas en los costados pero para su precio está bien"
"Apple","iPhone 11","La verdad estoy muy satisfecho estética 9.9 solo unos raspones microscopicos alrededor de la lente de una cámara literal ni se nota ni afecta en nada la batería me llego al 92% llevo 1 mes con el equipo y me siento satisfecho con la compra. Recomendado. Obvio el cargador y accesorios son genéricos pero vale la pena invertirle por aparte a un cargador original para no dañar el equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego rápido, con un golpe en la parte de arriba, hasta ahorita no ha fallado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo compré en el hot sale así que me salió muy barato, pero llegó con 88% de pila que rapidamente bajo al 87 ya que estaba mas abajo que arriba, me habría gustado tener la suerte de uno de +95 de pila"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Biene muy buen empacado obviamente no incluye accesorios originales todos genéricos y en cuanto a estética del dispositivo solo llego con unos daños en la parte de la cámara son leves pero si son notorios"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego sin ningún detalle estético, batería al 80%, una de las dos bocinas no se escucha pero el audio es excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Vino impecable, sin un rasguño y todo perfecto, el detalle es que al entrar a configuración me salió un aviso de pantalla no original, lo cual significa que la cambiaron, por ahora funciona como si fuera original, el otro aspecto con el que no me sentí completamente feliz fue que la batería vino al 82%, está dentro de lo acordado sin embargo a otros usuarios les llegó al 90-100. Esta reseña es con dos semanas de uso."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciona muy bien ya tengo un tiempo con el y sin ningún problema"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto me llego bien y en perfecto estado, la pila esta al 80% de su vida util, llevo ya casi medio año y no he tenido problemas, ni de pila, ni con actualizaciones de iOS."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Ya lo probé y al parecer todo está en funcionamiento, solo con el detalle que llego al 85% de capacidad de la batería, pero ps ocupó un teléfono."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó en una caja genérica, pero bien protegido. Revisándolo a fondo no tiene ningún detalle, se ve como nuevo. Lo único, me llegó con 83% de vida de la batería, pero funciona excelente; hay veces que lo desconecto por la madrugada, lo uso desde la mañana y cuando regreso a casa por la noche, tiene aún el 60%, también depende de su uso, pues viendo contenido multimedia dura unas 12 horasFue comprado en Westend Enterprises Inc. el servicio fue excelente, resolvieron todas mis dudas y hasta me lo facturaron!"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El iPhone venía en muy buen estado, con los accesorios que mencionan pero esperaba un mejor estado de la batería ( llegó con el 80%) venía sin rayones y bien envuelto :)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tenia mis dudas al comprar un dispositivo ""reacondicionado"" por algunos comentarios, pero en este caso el celular me llego en excelentes condiciones. Si tiene pequeños detalles como que la batería esta al 99% y en mi caso tenia algunas líneas en el cristal muy pequeñas que apenas se ven (que con una funda esas madres ni se ven). Pero en todo lo demás el dispositivo se siente como nuevo y el precio estoy completamente satisfecho."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono cuando lo recibí fue la emoción de mi vida, estética estaba casi al 100 (pequeños golpes parte de arriba) pero en cuando lo empece a usar vino la decepción, hice la restauración de toda mi información y la pasé de mi otro iPhone a este y el teléfono se empezó a calentar horrible y conforme lo seguí usando el teléfono se seguía calentando, lo puse a cargar y tardo 3 hrs cuando mi otro cel se cargaba en totalidad en 1 estando muerto, y cuando lo comencé a utilizar bajo súper rápido la pila y de igual manera si lo usaba continuamente se calentaba :( tenía miedo de comprar reacondicionado por temas como este, pensé que sería la excepción pero veo que no :c estoy muy decepcionada, trataré de usarlo una semana pero si continúa así lo cambiaré porque es un teléfono que no podré utilizar al día"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego extremadamente rayado de la pantalla, hasta parecería que un poco coarteado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen iPhone, llego en mi caso algunos días antes de lo previsto, el equipo viene con batería al 84%, un pequeño rayón en el bisel y algunos arañazos profundos en pantalla (se disimulan con la mica), eso es lo que me pareció no Tan bueno, en las cosas buenas, vaya, es un iPhone, todo lo demás sumamente funcional y normal sin ningún problema, si recomiendo comprar por el precio al que lo conseguí, sugiero estar pendientes con las variaciones de precio y buscar el más bajo, le daría un 8.5 a la transacción en general"
"Apple","iPhone 11","LLEGO TODO BIEN EXCEPTO LA PANTALLA, VIENE MUY RAYADA Y YA TRAIA UNA MICA PUESTA PARA TAPAR TANTO RAYONTODO LO DEMAS BIEN"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Hola, el celular llego con estética de 10, pero, las bocinas se escuchaban como reventadas además de que venía contl rendimiento del 73% pues las especificaciones decían que venían arriba de 80%."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La vida de la batería estaba muy baja"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Todo llegó en buen estado y funciona perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusto y cumple, no lo regresareBuen producto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Went to set up the phone but facial id isn't working. There is an alert that face id has been disabled because there is a problem with the true depth camera. When investigating that issue, I see another alert for battery capacity that says the battery is significantly degraded with maximum capacity of 77%. The posting said 80% plus batter capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó en muy buen estado, sin rayones ni nada, eso si el cargador no es original hay que comprarse uno. Traía el 85% de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llego en perfectas condiciones, estética de 10 solo con un pequeño rayón en una esquina el cual noté días después, la condición de batería esta al 88%, muy satisfecha"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llegó con 80% de batería; la estética esta muy bien aunque tiene detalles. Es bien teléfono para el el precio pagado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El iPhone llego en perfecto estado , parece nuevo , me llego en 85% de batería, todo bien hasta ahora"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Al ser un teléfono reacondicionado llegó en muy buenas condiciones, batería con más del 90%, cargador y cable genérico.Solo se aprecia un pequeño golpe en uno de los bordes, si lo ves con detenimiento. En general está en perfectas condiciones."
"Apple","iPhone 11","la condición de la batería se encuentra en 76% sin embargo estéticamente esta en buen estado así como también se encuentra funcionando correctamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El iPhone no presentaba ni un solo rasguño en la parte trasera ni en la delantera, vino con un porcentaje de 83% en batería, solo tenía un pequeño detalle visible alrededor de la entrada del cargador pero nada de importancia, lo que me di cuenta días después fue que una de sus bocinas no funcionaba, pero aún así cuenta con un volumen y calidad de audio excelentes"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Aunque está en muy buenas condiciones, el proveedor no corroboró que la operación del celular estuviera en perfectas condiciones. El volumen del auricular es muy bajo (creo que este fue un defecto de fabricación en los primeros iPhone 11). Pero debería haber sido mencionando en el anuncio de venta. Por lo demás está bien elProducto y la entrega fue rápida y segura. Ante mi queja el vendedor aceptó que se devolviera él producto pero decidí quedarme con elCelular a pesar de este defecto."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy bajo porcentaje de condición de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen producto. Estética 9/10, llegó con 2 rayones en el costado, pero el resto del equipo está impecable.Condición de la batería 87%. Todo funciona bien.Sí lo volvería a comprar. Sugiero que compren productos de Estados Unidos, les dan mejor cuidado que en Mexico. Mejor aún si pueden/tienen busquen “reacondicionado Premium”, sale más caro pero es prácticamente un teléfono nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me llego en un muy buen estado y con batería al 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 11","If you're purchasing this from outside the U.S, the ""final price"" at purchase isn't the final price because the taxes and shipping fee hasn't been applied yet (it will do so once shipped, and then you'll see the charges in your bank account). This is not the company's fault, and it is something Amazon should make clear to their customers. At first I was upset at the seller due to my misunderstanding, but after communicating with them, they did their best to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with the transaction. Before leaving a negative review, message the seller and I'm sure they'll try to help you out, especially if you're unsure about some of the details in their advertisement.The seller delivers on promise on what the phone comes with (although a nitpick, the battery was not near 80 percent). The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case. This product is worth the money, in my opinion."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Funciona bien llego con 86 de batería pero si venia con algunos rayones tanto en la pantalla como en la parte de atrás, venía intacto de las esquinas y las bocinas se escuchan bien los rayones los disimulé con micas de cristal de verdad con mica no se notan nada cuando su celular Rea condicionado venga con micas retírenlas para verificar que este en buen estado ya que de verdad no se les nota nada con ellas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","The media could not be loaded.
 Had a couple of concerns at the beginning but they were quick to respond and help. Very happy with the phone and service"
"Apple","iPhone 11"," Had a couple of concerns at the beginning but they were quick to respond and help. Very happy with the phone and service"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El serbio es excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","De muy buena calidad llevo un mes con él y no me ha fallado"
"Apple","iPhone 11","En sí el producto se ve muy muy poco usado, me llegó con 99% del estado de la batería, los 256gb que pedí, hasta ahora ha funcionado con normalidad, el único detalle que me percaté fue que al ver otro iPhone 11 de un amigo (que se adquirió nuevo), lo sentí con más calidad en la pantalla, muy probablemente el que me dieron cuente con una pantalla genérica, no se ve taaaan mal, pero tengo que admitir que la sensación de la calidad de pantalla del otro iPhone me agradó muchísimo más…"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Precio está bien de acuerdo al equipo"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No por que no es lo que ofrecen"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No me gusto que viniera con 84% de batería"
"Apple","iPhone 11","No es recomendable si buscas un teléfono en buen estado aunque si es para remplazar alguno ya usado esta bien, llegó rápido pero no funciona la el cargador y al parecer tenía un bloqueo que no dejaba descargar aplicaciones"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Las bocinas no se escuchaban bien,se escuchaban pésimo,y la batería me llegó con un 84% (algo bien)"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Tenia mis dudas sobre comprar un producto reacondicionado, pero tome el riesgo y quede bastante satisfecho! me llego con la pila al 95% y ningun rayon en la pantalla. Si acaso tenia unos pequeños raspones en la parte inferior donde se carga pero no se veian a simple vista. El cargador tiene el Certificado y funciona bastante bien, aunque opte por comprar su cargador original. En Conclusion, se los recomiendo bastante por el precio que pagas, y con amazon tienes la garantia de 90 dias ante cualquier falla o no estar satisfecho! llevo 2 semanas de uso aproximadamente y hasta ahora todo correcto, lo volveria comprar sin problemas o por lo menos tomare en cuenta esta opcion cuando quiera cambiar de celular! Vale la pena animarse por la garantia que dan,"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono me llegó sin ningún rasguño en la pantalla ni en la parte trasera, vida de la batería en 89%. Hasta el momento no ha presentado fallas"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El display con el que venía era muy genérico, pésima calidad, de ahí en fuera el celular no tiene ninguna falla."
"Apple","iPhone 11","So far, so good. It was exactly as promised. HAve to use it for some time to see if there will be any concerns."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Buen dispositivo el único detalle es un pequeño rayón en la pantalla pero con la mica ni siquiera se nota, la batería se encontraba al 81% de salud y en menos de una semana bajo a 80% de ahí en fuera el dispositivo funciona de manera correcta, espero la batería se mantenga en ese porcentaje de vida por un buen rato en caso de algún detalle actualizare mi reseña."
"Apple","iPhone 11","I heard so many bad stories about Amazon Renewed iPhone and have a bad experience before, but I gave another chance as it was sold by different seller. Besides 85 percent battery life (Which is ok enough for Amazon standards but still bit disappointing), it is in perfect condition and also nice color."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Estéticamente tiene sus detalles obvio no es nuevo pero asta el momento funciona bien espero que dure un buen rato así"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El cel llegó súper bien con la pila a más del 90% llevo tiempo con el y sigue súper bien, muy recomendado el vendedor"
"Apple","iPhone 11","El producto es bueno, a pesar de lo comentarios si recibes un teléfono con hasta el 95% de batería.
Sin embargo el teléfono fue dañado en el proceso, por ello hay que estar al pendientes del estado."
"Apple","iPhone 11","El teléfono impecable como bien lo describen , los accesorios genéricos pero nuevos y funcionan bien ."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Recién adquirí este equipo pues ya necesitaba cambiar mi cel después de 6 años. La batería como tal mencionan es de más del 80% la parte trasera llegó con algunos golpecitos y rayones probablemente fue usado un rato sin protección y se golpeaba entre llaves o monedas.
Al final funciona bien y espero me dure otro par de años, en caso de que salga algún otro detalle iré actualizando esta ventana, considero que fue una buena compra por el precio y la capacidad de la memoria de 128gb."
"Apple","iPhone 11","It was easy to convert from my iPhone 6 to the 11. Phones mated and I changed the SIM card and Bingo everything worked. I was able to keep my current plan which was important to me. I think the price was fair and so I’m quite happy."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Me gusto el excelente estado en el que se encontraba. El porcentaje de bateria y el paquete bien protegido."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Muy buen producto, la pila al 80 %, estética 90% es lo que dice la descripción y se cumple, muy contento con la compra, dudaba mucho pero cuando llego todo cambio la verdad mejor de lo que esperaba volvería a comprar equipos de este tipo."
"Apple","iPhone 11","Lo único malo es que tiene un desperfecto en la parte superior de la pantalla y no deja utilizar esa parte de la pantalla. De ahí en fuera me gusto mucho el color, la cámara, el tamaño y es muy funcional."
"Apple","iPhone 11","La capacidad de batería está al 100% y funciona todo perfectamente"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Llegó con la pantalla muy rayada y batería al 81% no se como teniendo un supuesto control de calidad Amazon permita esto"
"Apple","iPhone 11","Solamente tiene unos rayones algo considerables la pantalla pero nada que afecte el funcionamiento, de ahí en más todo funciona al 100 lo recomiendo mucho"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Was a bit skeptical purchasing a refurbished item, as I have had problems in the past. Since I needed a larger sized phone, due to visual impairment, I opted to try a refurbed product again and kept my fingers crossed that it wouldn't disappoint. I am so very happy that I gave it another try. The ipnone 12 pro max showed up in a structurally sound package, looked brand new, and had an excellent battery percentage at 97%. My only complaint is that even though for listening to music and watching videos the sound is excellent, for notifications and incoming call notification, the volume is extremely low, even though in settings everything is set correctly and sound is set to max. Other than that, I am a very happy customer."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","It made for a great gift"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Great Product With An Amazing Battery Life… Mag Safe Is What I Love About It…. I DoorDash, SO I Use It With The Pitaka Mag-Safe Vent Car Mount… The GPS Which I Call GOD POWERED SYSTEM On The iPhone Is Amazing And With That Pitaka Mount I Can Put My iPhone 12 Pro Max In Portrait Or Landscape GPS And I Can Keep On Rollin’!… I Love ❤️ It!🙏😍😇…. As A Matter Of Fact: I Like It, I Love It, I Want Some More Of It!😃"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","everything arrives as described
the battery at 100% life
no bumps or scratches
all in order"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro Premium thinking I had eliminated all the problems associated with buying a used phone. The ""Premium"" in the purchase was a promise of a cosmetically excellent iPhone with a one-year guarantee and a minimum battery health of 90%. Well, therein lies the rub. The exterior of the phone was excellent but upon checking the battery health I found it to be 87%. I might have been willing to accept it, but I noticed on the inspection card that all items had been checked off including the 90% battery health, but the card had not been signed or initialed. I started thinking about what else had not been checked so I boxed it up and sent it back. I'll try it again because I believe that one person doesn't make or break a company."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","When my phone arrived it was flawless, not a scratch or scuff. The phone was easy to setup and the price was well worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","My first iPhone coming from a Galaxy 9+ and I’ve been loving it. The battery life is great, health came in at 97% and despite me being an avid social media user, it stays charged all day. It had some tiny scratches on the sides but I didn’t mind cause it was used. I got screen protectors and a few cases and I LOVE IT."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Phone is amazing, came quickly looked like new and runs like new"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Beats buying a brand new phone considering Amazon's warranty and customer service"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Me encanta. Llego rápido y en la caja nuevo. Parece que lo compré en un lugar official."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","<3<3<3"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","So I first had ordered this phone but it was only renewed, I got the phone and it was in bad shape, so I returned it. Then I came across Amazon renewed premium so I decided to give it one more shot. They promised that the batter life would be above 90% so I took a chance. I was absolutely blown away, when I got the phone all setup I viewed the battery health and it was 100%! Super happy with this phone and I saved around $250 compared to buying it brand new!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Great seller ! Item functions as described. Original quality iphone 12 Pro Max! Great IOS simple to navigate and use. The IOS ecosystem is good for those who prefer Apple products from ipads to Apple watch or Airpods."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","It seems like a pretty functional phone.. appears to work well in most capacities other than the battery, which is right off the bat draining very quickly with very mild usage. (Was assured to be at 90+%)(the last refurbished iPhone I bought came at 98% and after 2 years of usage is at 92%) So it’s a bit of a bummer because I’m just going to have to get the battery replaced soon. I honestly might just exchange the phone soon, just throughout writing this review the battery has drained 7%…. That is terrible in my opinion."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","El producto está como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","After deciding I wanted to upgrade my phone I figured that going the “renewed” direction was the most affordable option. I must say I was very hesitant at first. Even when I got the device, the plastic on it gave the impression it was banged up and the screen possibly cracked. Luckily for me I realized it was just the plastic, and after removing the phone looked as though it came straight out the apple store. It works just as good as well. All in all so far I think it was a great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","This is what I was looking for and will probably get the next version next year"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","love"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I think all iPhones are great phones-long time user here. I specifically wanted a 12 Pro Max; tried the 13 Pro Max from Apple Store & felt it was too heavy. This model just right and has almost all same features as the new 13. Hard to find locally to purchase, and the Renewed Premium is just like a new phone. Battery maximum capacity on it is 99% and body looks flawless! Definitely worth purchasing a Renewed Premium."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","This iPhone works like it’s brand new. If you are looking for a phone like this Buy it. Everything works as it should. Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Soooo I’m originally a Samsung type a girl but my kids kept pressing me to try IPhone and I brought the 12 pro max, the phone over all is a great phone. It has face recognition for all my apps and purchases. My battery life is excellent also it will stay charged all day. The phone also came clean and with a cord and wall charger. I’ve had it little over a month and so far so good it came with a yr warranty, so I’m very pleased with this buy"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Face Recognition works great but read that it is too easy to replicate so I don’t use it. Prefer fingerprint recognition. Other than that the phone is great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo funciona perfectamente, la batería dura lo esperado y esta como nuevo, es rápido y perfecto para mi labor comercial"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The iphone12 has a great camera"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Like new, just dont have original box, but the phone likenew"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Arrived with 89% battery life and small scratches on the screen. This is my first Renewed Premium purchase. Is this atypical?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Only thing I dislike is the battery life is very bad , my iPhone 11 Pro Max the battery in it would last 3or more days on a full charge but this one doesn’t go one day unless I have It on airplane mode all day ….and my boss doesn’t dig that"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I made a very good choice the phone is clean no scratch or dents the battery life is very good and everything works perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The first phone I did not have the correct storage capacity. The replacement phone I received, the Face ID didn’t work."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","It’s like a brand new phone. Battery life excellent 96%. Everything works great, no scratches no nothing as i said it’s like a brand new phone and I’d recommend anyone to buy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Not a scratch or blemish on the phone. It looks absolutely brand new. Battery health is 100% out of the box. Set up was flawless. No issues. A great buy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Nice phone...I received it with no scratches and battery life is perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max"," Nice phone...I received it with no scratches and battery life is perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","This iPhone 12 Pro MAX set up was a bit rocky, but with a reset everything was fine. battery life is very good. looks like a brand new phone. If you have small hands, this is not for you."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","As new , no difference.You have inside certified charger (1500 mAh max charge rate - slow but good for your battery health) and a certified but short cable.Overall satisfaction -excellent, using it second week - good battery life,responsive screen, very good pictures!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I got exactly what I ordered, so far no complaints, it came clean inside and out and was a breeze to set up. I upgraded from my 7S so the whole thing is a huge upgrade for me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","My"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Estás todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I think it’s perfect I might buy some other devices from Amazon if my second experience is great also."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Package came on time and the phone is in great condition. It comes with charging cable!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Well I was skeptical about renewed phone, this one was perfect. Very happy with this product, I can recommend to everyone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Excelente en todo sentido"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Battery around 94%, very clean. Very good condition. The charger can be better. Works with Argentina cell phone carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Had issues trying to set it up but it’s a really good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Completamente complacido con el teléfono. 100 % satisfecho. Todo funciona perfectamente y el equipo luce completamente nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Arrived with a broken camera. Lines in the primary camera that appear on screen and in pictures. What a waste of time setting up the eSIM and having to go back to my old device. The device also had only 90% battery life -- the bare minimum for ""Premium Renewed."" Won't fall for the ""Premium Renewed"" shtick again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","And she knew that always one the IPhone 13 pro max that’s why I changed my main"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","BAD BATTERY EVEN WHEN MANY BACKGROUND APPS ARE TURED OFF—"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I've ordered two phones now at ""renewed premium"" from Amazon. Both had battery life of ~85%. Super frustrating, as there is a big price difference between ""renewed premium"" and ""renewed"".

Cosmetically, there were both in pretty great shape."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Its overall performance is just so much better in every way, especially how easy to use."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Phone was in perfect conditions and it works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I like everything about the product"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Face recognition is remarkable."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Looks brand new for a refurbished product. Thank you!"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Basically new, in great shape, very happy with it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Packaging was nice"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","this phone is absolutely perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I bought this iPhone 12 Max because it was advertised as ""unlocked"". I received it and installed it on my TMoble account. However, it would struggle to get onto the network and stay on it. I took it to TMobile and they gave me a new SIM card and the phone still struggled to find the network. As it turned out, the phone always looked for an AT&T network. This phone was also previously an AT&T phone per the codes in the phone's identification information. No matter how many times I selected the TMobile network it always switched back to the AT&T network and hence the phone was unreliable with connecting and staying on the network."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Alot of scratches on the front screen, and the phone had icloud locked by previous owner. Great job for a thousand dollars phone . And sure it been tested by professional technicians before it's going to your hand lol ."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I ordered this phone in plenty of time, weeks before my son would get home on leave from the army. Got it charged up, & when he arrived we went to the Verizon store to get it activated. Turns out it was a locked phone, even though Amazon advertised it as an UNLOCKED phone right in the item description. Horrible. Waste of my time, and now we may not have time to get him another phone before he leaves. Amazon screwed this up entirely."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","This phone has major sound issues I feel like I bought a broken phone. It does not have sound sometimes. I don’t think you should buy from these people. I tried to return it and I never got a response. I d give them no stars if possible"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The battery is not good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Came home was happy I got it went to update it then all a sudden keeps restarting n wont stop"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","This renewed premium ""like new"" iPhone was nothing of the sort. It had three defects in the screen, one of which was as big as the head of a match! Avoid this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","EL CARGADOR NO ES COMPATIBLE CON EL CELULAR YA SE ARRUINO"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Really disappointing they lie about the one main thing that makes this phone cost more than regular renewed."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Title of review are words spoken by my older brother. In spite of the fact that this iPhone was “renewed,” my brother never mentioned this fact to me because for him it’s brand new. He is totally obsessed with all apps, cameras, ease of use, sound quality, and Pacific Blue color. Tremendous battery life and 256GB storage are awesome! I absolutely agree with my brother because I own the same phone in Silver. If you’re concerned that this phone isn’t compatible with the AT&T mobile network, DON’T BE!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I reviewed the product and it looks good without any physical damage, I did not get the original charger but that is not a big deal. I will update this review based on how this iPhone works in the next couple of months but I would recommend to buy"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","I upgraded from an iPhone 8 to use as my work phone. The speed and performance upgrades are super noticeable, and the battery life is in a whole new world. It doesn’t have a fingerprint reader like I was used to, but the facial recognition works flawlessly, even wearing glasses. I’m loving this phone"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","What else can I say"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The title says that it was supposed to be minimum of 90% battery health but I got only 84%. I am disappointed with the phone. The exterior of the phone was excellent but upon checking the battery health I found it to be 84%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The phone came came like new! I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely buy another from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Really like my phone. Not as quick as I’d like but it could be the area we live in. I would buy again."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Upgraded from an XR and loved the 12 pro max. Definitely worth it and great price for being unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Primera vez que compro un equipo renovado. No sabía que esperar. En Apple resulta que los equipos RENOVADOS PREMIUM son mejores y tienen una garantía más larga que los No Premium. Este teléfono que compré venía en una caja blanca con verde de AMAZON y en el interior un cable y cargador genéricos. Al remover la protección de plástico del teléfono, mi sorpresa fue encontrar un equipo PRÁCTICAMENTE NUEVO. Ningún golpe ni marca de otro tipo. Lo único que encontré (y porque le estuve buscando algo) una rayita diminuta en la pantalla junto al marco. Raya superficial de unos dos milímetros… La batería está al 91% y al encenderlo de inmediato se actualizo el sistema operativo a IOS 16.1.2
TODO, todo funciona muy bien. No se nota la diferencia entre un equipo nuevo y este. Definitivamente, es una Excelente inversión y decisión ir por este equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Excelente compra, es mi primera vez comprando re acondicionado y debo admitirlo fue una excelente compra me llegó casi impecable y con 98% de batería. Sin duda alguna es una buena opción"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Todo bien es un producto premium cumple con las expectativas lo único malo es que dice en las especificaciones que viene con un 90% de batería pero cuando lo revise tenía un 85%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo esta en unas condiciones que casi parece nuevo, solamente por que tiene un poco de suciedad en el auricular pero super bien cuidado"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","el equipo esta ok pero en la descripción dice que al menos 90% y el mio llego en 87%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","excelente producto, en excelentes condiciones, como nuevo, muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Me encanta"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Justo lo que esperaba! Excelente estado! Color y belleza!! Me gustó🥰"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo me llego con una estética 10 de 10 prácticamente como nuevo, en cuestión de la batería me llego con el 100% llevo utilizándolo alrededor de 20 días y su funcionamiento es el adecuado, el equipo viene liberado yo lo estoy usando en AT&T, el único detalle es en el cargador que es muy genérico pero funcional sin duda alguna volvería a comprar"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","El equipo llego 10/10 parecía completamente nuevo, el mes de uso dejó de obtener señal, lo lleve a revisar y estaba fracturado de la tarjeta, me cobraron 200 dls por soldarlo,"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Llego súper bien. Sin ninguna detalle, con la batería al 100%; todo increíble, fue muy buena decisión.Más de 1 mes sin problemas!Recomendado!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded.
 Muy buena experiencia con la compra llego dos días antes de lo que decía, venía con el 91% de batería ( al parecer jamás se ah abierto el equipo) como nuevo prácticamente, si recomiendo comprar al menos mi experiencia fue excelente"

Muy recomendable"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Compré este iPhone con el miedo de que no cumpliera mis expectativas, afortunadamente, este iPhone se encuentra ""Cómo nuevo"" lo inspeccione durante un tiempo considerable y no tiene ni un solo rasguño, la batería de encontraba al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Llegó con menos de 90% de batería y con el certificado que dice que si la tiene, además de que la bocina de abajo vino rota y todos los botones y altavoces llenos de tierra eso quiere decir que ni siquiera le hacen una limpieza, no me quisieron devolver ni siquiera el dinero de la reparación de la bocina y los accesorios que trae como el cargador son de la calidad más baja posible; solo el cable es mfi el cubo estaba más chafa que nada."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","Todo muy bien"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro Max","el celular llego con una lijera raya en la pantalla, poco perceptible, pero para mi es un daño, al encenderlo y elejir el idioma, ahí se queda y no avanza, pésima experiencia, ahora espero no me den tantas vueltas con mi reembolso ya que solicité la devolución"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I just received this device today. After inspection I could not find any scratches or signs of wear. It looks brand new. It powers up, charges, connects to wifi, etc. as it should. Activating service was easy and fast, just had to insert the sim card from my old device. Battery is at 89%. I am very happy with this purchase thus far. I will update if there are any hiccups"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Usually the term refurbished and renewed scares people and right fully so. There are many sellers online that sell junk. If you carefully research the seller, you can have a great experience and save LOTS of $$. I bought this iPhone 12 Pro from Mobile Supply on AMZ and the phone was excellent! It honestly looked brand new. The seller was prompt and courteous on communication.
I have bought other Renewed items on AMZ and have had good experiences, but I would check out the seller each time."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Minor scratches on the side and screen but it’s really good device. My mom liked it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Compré el dispositivo con ""excelente condición"" pero la batería llegó con el 80 porciento lo cual considero no es ""excelente"""

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone has no scratches, looks just like brand new. Battery life is 92% and the phone works just fine. Definitely recommend this seller."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Changed my review again seller sent screen with a screen protector in addition. Had given them 4 stars because of the price at the time but had changed it to 5 stars because everything about phone is excellent."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Me enamores de este cel con ese color que elegí gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","**Edit** 10/12/2022:

This phone's battery has now decreased to 96% since my last update a week ago. I lowered to 3 stars from 4 stars as this phone seems to be degrading fast!

------
Ordered this phone as a cost effective alternative to the 13 and/or 14 as the features and ""Bells and Whistles"". Was forced to update my previous device as the iPhone 7 no longer supports iOS 16 :-(

Thoughts on this order/process:

Pros:

-Looks brand new
-Faster than my iPhone 7 ;-)
-Camera is awesome
-Battery Life (con below) was received at 98%!
-Fast, seamless setup.
-Unlocked and Not T-Mobile (which I originally ordered)
-Came with charger cord/adapter
-Fast delivery
-Apple certified parts validated in settings (screen, etc.)

Cons:

-Battery life went to 97% after one week of use?! That makes me very nervous.
-There were some dings I found on the outer edge of the phone in 4 places-No biggie as there's a cover on it now.
-Wish there was an option for T-mobile vs. Unlocked. Apparently, there are multiple sellers on this product and even though I chose ""T-mobile"" I received ""Unlocked"" which is fine, but I paid more for the T-mobile vs. another seller that was a cheaper ""Unlocked"" option.

Other than that I'd rate this purchase 4-4.5. I will update accordingly as I progress with the life of this device. I'm just so happy to be upgraded to a newer iPhone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Super fast delivery. Product delivered ahead of schedule. Good quality."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Good product with very good customer service"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I’m a little annoyed that the price dropped from $696 to $629 a couple days after ordering but I guess my timing was off with the 14 coming out. Battery health is at 90% but otherwise the phone is like new. Camera is such a step up from my XR! Definitely faster and I have better signal with the 5G. Happy with my purchase just wish I got a better deal. Comes with an extra charger which is nice because Apple does not include chargers anymore."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Nice clean pretty much like new very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It great for the price"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone looks and works perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Like new condition, everything works! Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone arrived and was already powered on, which was strange. Came FILTHY. Gross caked on crud around the volume on/off switch, the speakers, and battery port so you knew the previous owner had a case on it. Tried to clean it because I wasn’t sure if it was dirty or scratched but the gold edges were very scratched and chipped. Couple of scratches on the cameras. Didn’t activate phone so can’t say if this effects it yet. The price went down so I’ve ordered a second one. Whichever is least-worse I guess I’ll deal with. Will update."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I was very skeptical buying a refurbished phone but I am so happy I did! This phone is so amazing! There isn’t a single scratch on it and the battery life is even at 90%! Worth the money 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It’s like a brand new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Todo bien pero una de las salidas de sonido ya no se escucha y por lo que vi a la mayoría le tocó la condición de la batería mayor a 95% y eso que compre la versión renovada en excelente estado… es recomendable comprar l versión en medio y no la excelente porque no le veo diferencia… puedo regresarlo hasta noviembre ahí veo que tal va x 1 mes pero por el momento todo bien…"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Face recognition was on point . And battery life has been good . Way better than my old XR."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone arrived 2 days early in neat packaging. It also came with a charger and thank you note. 100% battery life and the quality felt brand new. I recommend this company for phones for sure. Great service!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is great!! Looks like it just came out of the box! Real value for money!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Good phone, it arrived in the estimated time, it does not have any scratches, neither on the screen, nor on the cameras, nor on the back. Everything works very well, and came with 89% battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I was very surprised. arrived as new, well before the deadline is very well packaged."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Feels like new. Some issues with the mic some times but overall good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The seller is very responsive if you have any concerns or questions. Iphone 12 Pro came super fast and I am impressed, like new condition and the battery health is 100 percent. Very happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phones great and does everything an Iphone can do. Hopefully I dont need to purchase another phone for the next 2 years."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone arrived without a scratch or ding. Looks brand new and has 100% battery life! Very satisfied with purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I just got my iPhone 12 pro in mail today, I want say it package real nice and phone feel luxury even thou is refurbished. In addition I will do my review testing out the phone and see if there's any fake going on but however it came in good shape, no scratches what so ever. I like this alot and seller that send it too me did well because I am young guy review all my purchases and money is worth it spend that. So guy if you want buy refurbished iPhone trust me is worth it, I am going take picture and do a video soon on it. I appreciate amazon as loyal customer and more shopping to come in the future. Appreciate however read this and let see how the phone goes. Thirdly, I want thank seller for well design packaging got a charger and sim kit, I hope in the future people can be honest about thier review before at hand test before you write about it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Battery life was 100% and condition was great,
Also got double the storage for no additional charge!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Product was perfect love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Really great!! In perfect condition, except battery with 80%, but as expected! Function and no scratches nor the screen or anywhere else, which was amazing for me for this price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Love the phone. Been wanting it since it came out and finally put some money together to buy it. I do must say I’m happy to be back with iPhone. I was stuck with a Motorola G4 for almost a year and a half and that phone took a beaten and I finally got tired of it lagging and been a bit of an annoyance to navigate. This phone is clean, sturdy, and very well put together. Love the cameras, I blew my friends mind when I showed him it could take pictures in the dark on SELFIE mode. Even for a refurbished phone it still looks brand new, no dings nor scratches. Looked very clean and smooth when I unwrapped it. And yea unwrapped it. Would’ve prefer getting the whole “brand new fresh off the box” experience. But I’m not complaining. They secured it pretty well. Package might not be filled with bubble wrap but this phone is durable. All they needed was to wrap it around with some foam and the phone got to me in one piece, looked brand new. Didn’t even have to squint my eye I swear.
Side note I didn’t put a rating on the finger print because I do not know whether this phone has one. I haven’t bothered the face recognition is enough. It won’t rwcognize your face with a mask on (obviously) but it does recognize from all kinds of angles. Literally even as far as your arms can reach. I’ve gotten myself an Apple Watch lately the 7 specifically and they go hand in hand love them both. I’ve had the phone for 4 months now and it still looks brand new, I still take it out of the case and feel it. I did spent a grand on it, which for a lot of people it is pretty pricy but so far I haven’t had a complain or a regret for buying a thousand dollar phone. Which was a HUGE thing before I bought it. Maybe it’s because I’m finally back with iPhone money doesn’t matter if you’re happy really.
Camera is crisp btw."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I was a bit skeptical about this company given some of the reviews but I’m so glad I took the chance. 2 things that shocked me was that the battery life is 100% and the phone came with a screen protector already on it, a new usb type c charging block and cable along with a pop socket. No regrets!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Looks and works like new. No scratches or anything"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente producto, llegó exactamente con todas sus descripciones de venta. Acertada inversión. Recomendado!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone smaller than desired..."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The refurbish condition of the product is as advertised, so I'm happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Lo compre porque decía en el anuncio condición excelente y me llegó con batería casi en 80 % y los bordes raspados. Mala inversión"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","El teléfono aspecto exterior genial, la batería para cambiar, al ser un móvil preowned esperas que el resultado sea mejor que uno solo re acondicionado. No merece la pena"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Que llego a tiempo y muy buen tel."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Es mucho mejor que comprarlo por allí, arriesgándose a una estafa"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Tengo el telefono ya 3 meses y hasta ahora todo esta perfecto. Lo utilizo en Ecuador y sirve bien con mi operadora. Entregado en caja generica, cable y cubo genericos de buena calidad. Nivel estetico 9/10 ya que la pantalla si muestra simbolos de uso y rasgpones menores.Finalmente para ser un telefono del 2020 es bastante costoso."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Creí que era más grande."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone 12 Pro I ordered is perfect! No issues, just had to pop my SIM card in! All functionality works as expected! Great product, Great Price!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Good product"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Great phone with no issues on the phone. The phone charger didn’t work, as it was probably a refurb too. The cost was a little high, but the phone was like new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","i Have not use it yet , because it has a small but deep scratch on the left side of it that why i do not know how it work. I might keep it for XM gift."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","a lot of scratches on the edges and screen. battery life is okay got 86."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone works good no problems speakers loud 👊🏽 that’s what I’m using to type this up"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I was happy with the item , but I had some issue with it , but we work it out successfully .the seller refunded me quicklythank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I have been buying Amazon refurbished devices for years and have always gotten great products. This phone was no exception. The time the phone shipped to me was super short. It did make me nervous when the phone didn't come in the Apple box, the phone was in mint condition. I also loved that there were screen protectors on the phone and a charger with the box. I have been putting this phone through the ringer and it is still great. Overall I would totally recommend getting this phone and I love mine."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This is my first iPhone bought by myself i worked for it and ummm I’m not going to lie I mean to purchase the Pro Max BUT I accidentally bought the Pro only so yup there it is But I must say the phone is still amazing and looks so nice like if I would’ve bought it from the apple store it had 100% battery life is 512GB that’s so good to have that much space to install how many games or videos I’d like and still have a toon of space overall I totally recommend this phone to anybody and it’s a great start before you get to the 13 Pro or Pro max because you don’t value stuff if you didn’t have something worse or less valuable before that definitely worth every penny."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","When trying to activate the phone, I went to my carriers local store and tried to have the store person install my SIM card for me since my previous phone was destroyed. Once I arrived to the store, the store person starts to explain that when my sim is inserted that the phone’s sim was locked to a carrier. That confused me cause i clearly bought an unlocked phone so I reached out to customer service. At first, they didn’t even address the fact that I couldn’t activate the phone cause even when I clicked on the carrier locked option in the settings, it said that I had to contact the cell phone provider since it was locked to a carrier. They even tried to send a link to me to try to contact them from a different website when we already had an amazon chat opened ?? Definitely got frustrated before customer service finally got back to me & showed how the phone sent was compatible for my cell provider by checking the IMEI in the settings. Thankfully the phone is finally working!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","There are two Big risks on the screen, then its a Good Condition phone, its not Excellent to me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Pretty good refurbish. Everything really looks brand new. No scratches or marks on any of the surfaces and very clean glass. It was packaged well and arrived in good condition. My only complaint is that it arrived a little dirty. If you are buying this you might want to purchase a phone cleaner as well. While the screen and other surfaces were clean the speakers and charging port had dirt and lint inside that need to be cleaned."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","the product came with no scratches and no damage at all but after a day of owning I discovered that the top speaker was not working"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","El encabezado del anuncio decía que se trataba de un 12 pro Max y a la hora de recibir el paquete llegó un 12 pro"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","My daughter is enjoying the iPhone 12. We had no problems with integration to Tmobile."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Not original charger but I’ll live def worth the savings will update if anything happens"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I had some doubts since this was not the super premium quality of renewed phone but it looks as new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The screen was not original"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","One camera lens appeared to have moisture/condensation inside, which made (3-4) watermarks/bubbles appear on the pictures."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","La batería ha funcionado genial, estado del 100%, no tenía ningún raspón ni nada, el color es hermoso y la cámara increíble. Solo no me gustó que el cargador no vino con el cúbito y el cable dañado"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It's the first time I ordered a refurbished phone, and the quality of the device is way better than I thought. iPhone has solid software and design. I compared it with my old 7...in a nutshell, the Size is comparable, the home button is missing, and the camera was added. Switching between the two generations was difficult due to the missing home button, but after a day, I'm almost stopping to press on the display... Face id works brilliantly. Even recognized me with glasses in the car"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I bought 2 copies, a Blue one and a Space Gray. The blue one arrived with a small scratch on the surface (not on the screen), but with 100% battery capacity. The gray one, arrived in perfect shape (no scratches anywhere) but with 88% of battery capacity.It is what you are buying, a Renewed phone, not new, not used, somewhere in the middle and is certainly a gamble. They both are working perfectly and have no other flaws, i would give the product in general 8 out of 10, and would recommend it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Iphone come along with charging cable, Nice pakaging but charging cable are not working"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","mala calidad de la pantalla"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It came early, and well packaged. And looks brand new. It’s definitely worth the money."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Good condition but battery doesn’t last much longer than my 2y old 11pro"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The iPhone 12 Pro is in over all good Condition but the battery Health is only at 90%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is in a great condition, it would have been perfect if the charger cable was in a better quality"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","El teléfono funciona muy bien, es un excelente teléfono sin desperfectos estéticos, pero con un detalle que esperaba no lo tuviera pero lo tuvo… la batería en condición de un 91%, un detalle."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Battery health is only 82%, not great"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","El celular están en muy buen estado pero, el encabezado del anuncio de este iPhone dice que es un 12 Pro Max (6,7 pulgadas), pero al recibirlo en realidad llega un 12 Pro (6,1 pulgadas)... Y para mi eso es engaño!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this refurbished. It looks brand new and works perfectly fine. In fact, it was so new you that it still came with the option to purchase AppleCare."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Hello, I first would like to say thank you for the timely shipping. However, I am not too impressed with the phone. I purchased from this seller specifically because of the reviews but it seems as if I got a bad phone. The front face of the phone is scratched to the top. The battery health is 88% and upon getting the turning on the phone it was dim, turned up the brightness still dim barely can see. This resulted with me taking it to the Apple Store and having them take a look. They told me it’s either software issue or a problem with the phone. I spent the money for an excellent condition phone and I’m not getting this"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","My phone came with 100% battery capacity, no perceivable external damage. It was almost like new. Currently trouble shooting my phone crashing in video mode. Will up my stars if the issue gets resolved."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I received my new phone yesterday and was delivered as promised. Arrived in excellent condition with a battery health of 100% which is far better than promised. So far, I'm working thru the learning curve, but set up was a breeze."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Exactly as described. Arrived with no damage and unlocked allowing smooth transition to a new phone!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I love it because it it just like a brand new iPhone and it’s fully unlocked and you pay not as much"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Only had it for a few days, but everything works and it seems to hold a charge well. The phone itself looks like new aside from the tiniest, hair-thin scratch on the bottom right corner of the screen. But honestly, you can’t even see it and it might have been from me lol so I’m not counting it as damage. Overall, really nice phone for the refurbished price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I bought this phone in “excellent” condition. Got it in the mail and went through the whole process of setting it up & transferring all of my information off my other phone. My husband calls me on it and the speaker doesn’t work!!! The phone is broken! You can barely hear the other person on the other end talk! How in the world do you let someone spend almost $600 on a phone that doesn’t even work!!! Very disappointing! Now I have to go through the whole process of returning and waiting for another phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Great value for the price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Prior to me purchasing this product the reviews had me second guessing my decisions but after receiving my package i promise you all that it is worth it maybe i got lucky but despite all that i would definitely recommend purchasing commodities from trademore keep up the good job!!!-Jordi-Jovane"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Something wrong with the speaker"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone came as shown which was great, but the phone was locked so we couldn't use the phone no matter what we did. We tried to trouble shoot the phone to have the phone unlocked and we even found out that Verizon was the original carrier and called over to Verizon to unlock the phone and they couldn't unlock the phone. We liked the phone and wanted to keep it, but we were not able to as the phone was locked even though we were told it was unlocked. If we were able to use the phone and it was truly unlocked, I am confident we would have loved the phone and would have had no problems"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Works just as described"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It didn’t take long for the package to come, about 2 to 3 days. When it arrived, the phone looked like it was in perfect condition. Battery life was 94%, i recommend this product!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I am totally disappointed. I paid about $800 and expected the ”renewed” phone at least look complete. But there are scratches all over the phone and the top half of the screen is broken.I spent a day using it and tried to accept the fact. But cracks on the screen seriously affect the feelings of use. I'm going to buy a brand new phone and using this as a backup."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is okay all around except for the battery. Battery life is horrible and it came with a battery health of 86 which is almost the recommended replace number I think it should have had a replaced battery as apart of the refurbish but that clearly did not happen very dissatisfied with that but others then that the phone works well and everything else seems to be good but if battery life is important this may not be for you."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The product is brand new. Aside from the battery percentage being 87%, it cosmetically has no wear and tear at all, because I assume it had a really good case on it prior. Definitely a great purchase for 700$. The battery being that way does not change anything drastically for the potential trade in value of the phone anyways so if you’re looking in to a renewed phone you should have great luck. If you don’t, return it and simply get different phone and it will be assured quality."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Shipping was super fast, next day delivery. Battery life was very good (99%) and there was no obvious scratch. It has been more than a month since I got it, and everything is fine."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I heard that this phone is perfect especially for people who like taking pictures. I am very sorry that I have to return it at this time.I have only opened the packet and examined the phone. I have never turned it on. I did not input any information either. The only reason I entered a 3-star rating is because that goes either way.Thank you for your understanding."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","When the phone arrived it arrived in excellent condition! It had no cracks or scratches, and it had 97% battery life. The shipping is 2 days although my package arrived a little late because of the holiday. The customer service is great and I had someone to answer all my questions right away! Shop with this seller, everything is a 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was already logged in with a diagnostic app open, and the app showed that one of the cameras failed the test. The telephoto camera didn’t work and the phone said it detected a non-genuine apple camera. The battery health was also at 93%, which isn’t like-new. The only upside was that the body wasn’t scratched and did look like-new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Battery life was 92% which means I've only had to charge every other day. No scratches or marks on phone."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","the camera did not worked properly, ill be filing for a devolution"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone was in pristine condition, but the phone was NOT unlocked to all carriers, I called Apple and I called my carrier, nothing could be done. Could even find the previous carrier . Sim NOR e sim worked. I’ve bought refurbished/unlocked phones from Amazon before, this is the FIRST time the phone was locked by carrier, will be returning for a FULL refund🔥"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I have had good results with this purchase. Transfer of my information from my phone to this purchase was good, face recognition is good, no scratches or dings, battery life as described and I am pleased with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It’s a fine iPhone. I’m having a few issues with it, however. The GPS sometimes just doesn’t work (loses where I am when I’m using google maps or Waze). Also, the camera and flashlight buttons on the home screen sometimes do not work. I press the flashlight, for example, and the button appears to be pressed but the light doesn’t turn on. For the camera, the screen will just turn black. Otherwise it works fine."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Personal use"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was very good overall and the battery health was 100% but the screws of the phone were missing. You lost a star dude."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I've included photos of how the phone came and a water bottle for size reference. Overall, I'm pleased with my product. It came with a generic charger and surprisingly a SIM card tool opener. The phone arrived in like-new condition and the battery optimization was 92%. I easily transferred the SIM card from my old phone to the new one and set it up with my phone carrier with no problems."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Everything was great and transferred over. My only complaint was the face recognition didn’t work. Other than that everything was fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I like the product and it works like a new phone. The only negativity was the shipping took long after it got to FedEx facility in the city."

 The reviews had me worried and nervous about the iphone but it was all good, excellent product from Trademore. The product arrived before the estimated date. They are using fedex 2 days express delivery and signature are needed. So I received my iphone 12 pro 2 days after I made my payment in Amazon. My phone came in with zero scratches, zero dents, & 100% battery capacity. This felt like a new phone. Would definitely recommend."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phones looked fairly new with a tiny scratch on one. Battery life is at 91% and 89% on the two phones. This is a decent way to get recent technology at a reduced rate."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","No scratches battery is in good health"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Really good for its price. Battery isn’t horrible I was worried about the battery but I’m honestly suprised. (I’m not getting paid for my review)"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","More Information on working conditions and transparency on major repairs of the phone (such as replacing camera etc). I found out by chance that major repairs were done to the phone. Too much emphasis on ‘how’ the phone looks. Had I known in advance of the major repairs I would not have bought the phone. Price difference from new to renewed is too close."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Era tal cual se describia, tuve problemas anteriormente pero con Fedex para la entrega pero volvi a insistir y llego en excelente condiciones, recomendado trademore. Espero comprar mas telefonos!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Works perfectly and looks like new… recommended 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The battery is on the downside but the iphone is in awesome condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Stay away from the seller ELECTRONIC DEALS. I received the phone and was very disappointed with the non oem back glass repair they did. The phone didn’t have an Apple logo on the back and the back didn’t even match the phone color. It was a bluish gray instead of space gray. The rings around the cameras had scratches but the lenses themselves seemed okay. Then I went to make a phone call, the ear speaker is god awful/distorted and I had lots of trouble understanding what the person was saying over the phone. They obviously didn’t test that feature. The phone was poorly restored and should not have been sold under “excellent condition” luckily I was able to get a replacement from a different website and I paid pretty much the same price and I got a new 12 pro in mint condition. So I will definitely be using Swappa again in the future instead of buying Amazon renewed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Overall it was a great value. The battery health was as advertised (greater than 80%). It was 88% to be exact. The phone looks and works great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Great improvement with the addition of ""raw"" photos. Possibilities are endless."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is surprisingly in good condition. I’m shocked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I ordered this item by mistake. I’m sure it’s a good product."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It was slow and it felt like my iPhone 6S. The battery was not good either. It was at 80% when I got it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Just got my phone and it came exactly how I expected. Battery 90%! Completely unlocked because I live in Aruba! Just out my sim in and readyyyy!One minor scratch but you have to look really hard to find it. I guess I’m lucky🥳So happy I bought it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","El telefono llego con mínimas imperfecciones además la batería llego al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Definitely worth the money, works like new but the battery life is not what a new iPhones should be. Otherwise I’d highly recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","phone speaker didn't work, taking a long time for a refund and no acknowledgment that company got the phone back."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone actually came in before the date it was due."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Fast shipping, great product and accesories. No complains. Exactly what I ordered"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Awesome iPhone, came like new, no to not visible scratches. I got it connected right away with my provider without any problem. Face recognition, extraordinaire. Battery life, pretty descent to handle all those features and last about 24 hours. Great technology is expensive, so, the price is acceptable for an item that is almost perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I bought two of these phones, for my husband and I, with high hopes. One was fine, my only complaint for that one is that the battery is at 86%, but not noticeable.The second one was a disaster. Was fine when I first started it up, but then as I was setting it up I noticed that one of the back cameras was badly cracked. Now this wasn’t visible from the outside, but it was spiderwebbing cracked across two of the 3 cameras. Also, I got a warning pretty quickly by the phone that the screen was a third party screen and installed improperly. I went to the Apple Store and they said the best thing was to return it and just get my money back.I’m severely disappointed because now I have to go through the hassle of returning it as well as try and get a replacement. Not happy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The back of the phone was not glass. It was replaced, nowhere in the description stated this."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It’s a great phone but my phone back camera is having problems. My 12 Pro came in March 17 ,22 I don’t know why the camera doesn’t wanna focus it’s like trying to focus , but it’s shaking at the same time and making noises but if you zoom in or have wide view it doesn’t do that."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The look, feel, and performance of this iPhone 12 Pro is in no way distinguishable from a new one. Not a single scratch, blemish, dent, or scuff on this phone. I would think all electronics from this seller are in perfect condition. Battery life is 96%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Not sure what is up with this phone but it is the absolute slowest I have ever experienced. I thought that by ordering the 512G I would have a much faster loading time. I am wondering what is wrong with it. Even when I am connected to WiFi it takes 3-5 minutes to load internet browser pages. Not impressed at all & now have all my info loaded onto a phone that I am not satisfied or happy with."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I just got my phone and when I opened the box I saw the phone is already cracked. I didn't say anything until I saw the dirt inside the speakers, I was speechless... I put the phone to charge an hour ago and it's still on RED!!! I WANT REFUND ON MY ACCOUT!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","No scratches no marks no scuffs and battery health was 100% phone was like brand new…. The only thing that wasn’t up to par is it didn’t come with an original charging block but that’s a very small issue if any issue at all"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Some scratches on the screen. I bought it for my uncle but he doesn't pay attention to that kind of stuff. The main thing it's a working phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","For a renewed phone this is awesome! works perfectly no flaws battery is AWSOME! if i could give one piece of advice to the seller 86 FEDEX not the best haha but aside from the that the phone is a 10 out of 10 thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","the phone has a warranty and it came with a charger box and apple wire"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Looks like a new one... Works perfect and has no scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I amazed really fast shipping by Fedex. I got my phone with excellent cosmetics codition and battely life was 92%.I am so satisfied with it. Thank you!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Bought this phone since my other phone was broken. The appearance of it is great. Set it up and the camera option goes black. Contacted seller, but the suggested troubleshooting offered I had already done. Nothing fixed it! In addition, I can process a refund and return the phone which will leave me without a phone for over week. I need a phone with my job! I don’t recommend buying!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I'm not usually one to make an accusation like that so quickly, but this phone clearly was never inspected by anyone.Here is what is wrong with the device I got: - It cannot hold a charge past 10%, I cannot even complete setup because it requires 20% to update the software. - The charging port only works for one side of the lightning cable, meaning half the time you plug it in you have to flip it around and plug it in again. This iPhone's charging cable is designed to be plugged in either way and still work. - It is dirty and has several chips around where the metal casing and screen meet (not a big deal but it is DEFINITELY visible from any distance you look at it from).I am convinced that this phone was purchased on eBay or something and upsold on Amazon. I am very upset that the $720 I spent on this phone went nowhere and will be expecting a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Llego rayado 😡"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I was excited to get the new iPhone and willing to pay the amount it cost but then I take it out of the box it came in and it already had minor scratches on the display and It was really off putting I can’t stop staring at it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It can’t be updated and shut off every time"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I’m incredibly impressed with the quality in price combination. The battery health was over 95%! It arrived on time and looks amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Seriously, like a brand new phone! Can not tell the difference. Battery health is above 90% and little if any to no a scratches. Phone functions flawlessly. I would recommend this seller. Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The capacity battery come 91%. I think the come 100%.Awaiting return. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone came fast, battery was on zero and came with flimsy charging cord. Everything else looks good, no scratches, unlocked and battery was at 90% health. But now I've found out it get really really hot when I connect via Bluetooth for carplay navigation. I'll keep for a while and if this continues I'll be returning it.Update: The heating stopped but now I keep getting a “Water in lightening connector” message and I need to turn the phone off and on to get it chargingHappened like three times now and I didn’t bring the phone near any water.Looking seriously like I might return it"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone was packaged with care and the new looked like it was out of the box. It had a 100% battery health and came with charger and cable. I been using this phone heavily for the last week and had no problems what so ever. 10/10"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The sellers were amazing and were very helpful when I ad a slight issue. The phone was exactly what you'd expect, no scratches or marks, it was perfect condition in every way. It was delivered quickly and a reasonable price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","like they said fully unlocked yes it is fully unlocked andits great for me. The battery was a 7/10 but so far its pretty good and whoever said all these comments are all not real then they're mad maybe something happened with their phone but mine its perfectly fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This phone had a big chipped area on the camera lens with a Crack going up the whole lens. It's terrible that they would ship it with that as noticeable as it was. Terrible"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I'm truly bummed that this phone didn't work out. My carrier spent hours trying to get their system to port in the phone but couldn't. Their conclusion, based on the error codes they encountered, was that the phone was made for use outside the US and had a manufacturers block on it that couldn't be removed - or maybe fraud. I hesitate to say that but who knows. The good news is that I reported this to Amazon and the device provider just as I described above and the device provider refunded my payment through the Amazon system - no questions asked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","screen scratch everywhere."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","There’s few starches on the front screen. I hope this phone will last long."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This product is a 10/10 because the battery health was at 100% no crack dents and the camera and microphone worked and I would recommend this to to a friend."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone works great beyond the battery life. When I first got it, I noticed an easily drained battery. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, let it charge and used my old phone for the day.Fast forward 72hrs later, the battery life is better but not still draining easily after it drops below 80%. Thankfully I reached out to Amazon and they are sending me a replacement (thank you!)Hoping my Asurion warranty will work on my new replacement and not just this iPhone with the poor battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone is good, Because the screen has a scratch!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone didn’t work, it would just freeze when I try to set it up, also came with a minor crack on the screen, understand it s not new, but who wants to pay $600 to get a cracked screen.Took 10 days to have refund.Waste of time, but at least I got my money back."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The phone looks great except for near the charging port where there was a ton of scratches. This phone has a lot of static noise in it. The callers on the other end constantly complain that they cant hear me and its a lot of background noise and at other times, no sound. I can hear them fairly clearly but they have all sort of issues hearing me. This is my second purchase since the first one had cracks on the screen. Dont be like me, make sure that if you do purchase, thoroughly test it before sending it off to Canada as a gift! Save yourself the disappointment and expenses. Avoid these and just put the extra mone and buy from apple refurb or buy New if you can. Take my advice"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Unfortunately, there is no mobile hotspot available on this phone. My last iPhone did have it, so I took it down to the AT&T store, and they said that it was the phone not their service."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This was a gift for a 21st birthday. Battery was reading 86% and not 100%. Screen is said to keep shutting off every 20 seconds and technician states battery is worn out. Not happy that I paid over 700.00 for this. Technican also stated phone over a year old in use. Not pleased about how much issue there is with this apparently and now more money needs to be paid to fix it"

Hopefully he fixes it so I can give him the rating he deserves"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This is the refurbished phone I got from Digital Age USA, with brightness turned up all the way. Impossible to read. This is equivalent to the brightness turned to the lowest setting on my other iPhone. Sending it back for a refund. I wasn't sure if it was possible to troubleshoot this issue so I called Digital Age USA, but despite claiming they have a ""dedicated customer service staff available 8:30 - 6:30 CST/ 7 days"" no one picked up the phone after 2 attempts during those hours. Instead, I was greeted by a recorded message telling me to send an email via Amazon returns."

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","So bad product and seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Mala apariencia del artículo"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Scam"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I use to be a great fan of amazon renewed phones yet lately it appears quality control is severely lacking. Sometimes I’ve got lucky yet about 50% of the time it’s been a real hassle activating the phone just to discover immediately or down the road something is defective. On this particular phone the camera didn’t work from the get go. I’d press the shutter button and it would click yet a photo would not be taken. Quite frustrating when the sole reason I was upgrading from an 8 plus was for the improved camera.

If there is a good deal on a phone because they sell out so quickly you might want to buy 2 to insure that one of them works correctly. Personally, I am really reluctant to purchase another renewed phone because of the time involved setting up the phone only to have to spend more time taking it to a ups store to return it now that amazon doesn’t provide ups pickup wirhout paying an additional $7.99 for pickup."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Recived mine from a carrier new but coming from a 6s to a 12 is night and day! If your in the market for a decent iOS this is a great choice,my brother has the 12 mini he loves it,I even put aside my SE for this in Colbalt blue <3"

Es bueno !"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","It looks like the seller only posted these comments.
1250 for a renewed phone while a new one costs 1000 is very funny though."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I ordered my iPhone about a week ago used it for a day and a half and wouldn’t turn on even when left charging overnight. Ridiculous"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I returned the 1st one due to screen color but reordered from the same company & the 2nd one is flawless. Still waiting on my refund for 1st one but assuming there will be no issues there"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Phone was delivered a day early and appears to be in excellent condition. It seems like new and functions as it should so far.

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Perfect. I got everything what I need."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Arrived on time in really nice packaging. Phone was unlocked and in great condition, but there was a scratch on the glass (cannot see with a screen protector on). The phone came with a screen protector and the charger cord and brick *Apple take notes* . But overall this is one of the best bangs for your buck. Would recommend getting a case for the phone though."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Works excellent until now"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Buy it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","This is my favorite iPhone the only problem is when I received it the middle camera had a crack across it. Also the sides are scratched up and the sound ports were very dirty. The biggest thing is the battery life is at a 87% capacity when I bought it and I felt a little cheated because it kinda does pretty fast as well as my xr did. I also cannot ever get Siri to work for me on this phone and never had that problem before and ft is always cutting off at random times and I can’t ever call anyone they have to call me and I answer it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","So happy with my purchase. Phone works perfectly and battery life was 97."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","Came fully unlocked, super easy to set it up and the phone is awesomeness!"

"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","The media could not be loaded.
 Was skeptical at first but was a good buy. There was a little hiccup at first. I couldn’t put my old SIM card in the phone because it said carrier lock. But I went on direct unlock dot com. And paid $50 and they unlocked it so, now my phone says NO SIM RESTRICTION. Other than that little problem the phone looks brand new no scratches or cracks. Everything works good."

The software corrupted and I saw hell. the best part was seller agreed to take return the product. I got to know that. with the I refurbished there is always something mysterious problem that occurs."
"Apple","iPhone 12 Pro","I ordered a I phone 12 pro the ear speakers don’t even work and I’m unable to use the phone after realizing I contacted the seller and no response"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The product packaging was surprisingly good, the exterior of the phone seems to be in Very Good condition, practically untouched apart from a few scratches above the front camera in the notch. I bought a Used - Good phone, and it came with 85% battery. And yes it is a legit, Unlocked, Apple Certified smart phone. Would have loved to see a biggger battery capacity, but you get what you pay for and overall I’m immensely satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 12","So so happy with this purchase. I got this on a black friday sale so it was at a great discount. My old phone had become an absolute nightmare even though I'd only had it for 3 years because of poor storage (just 32 Gb), so every time I open ""iphone storage"" in my settings and see 256 GB, I get pretty giddy lol. Storage was really the most important factor for me when purchasing this, so I'm happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The main reason I bought this phone is for the camera. Having f-stops for portraiture is great! Being able to do portraits and have good bokeh is just phenomenal. I am still exploring the other features. The battery life seems to be good as well."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Traded up from my old iPhone to this i-12 phone. It is new and in perfect condition! Great folks to do business with. I can think of nothing that they have not done exceedingly well.

Thanks,

"Apple","iPhone 12","I received my iPhone 12 in good condition but I could not even set up the phone. Once I choose my country and region it freezes. After searching up some YouTube videos I fixed the problem"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My first I-Phone. I thought I would take a chance and purchase refurbished. I was pleasantly impressed. Works great. Nothing wrong with it. Thanks. No regrets."
"Apple","iPhone 12","the battery only came with 86% max power capacity but i never drop below 75% and i use the phone pretty frequently. i have to say that (knock on wood) everything seems to be going just as promised!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El porcentaje de batería es aceptable, los otros aspectos cumplieron con mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The Phone Came in Perfect Cosmetic Condition. the plastic wrapped in was a bit dirty and the sticker on the camera left a little residue on the phone, which was easily cleaned off. I thought the Renwewd Prenuim meant that the Battery health would be at least 90% or more, but it was 88% the phone. other than that little difference I would repurchase them. bought the phone for a customer. he was pretty happy with it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered the iPhone 12 and not a scratch on it. I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use.I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%.Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector.CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches. Front facing and the two back cameras ....Overall great purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It’s in beautiful condition and everything seems to work great so far. It’s only the first day I’ve had it, but so far I’m very happy with my purchase! I got it within a couple days after ordering too, which was a plus."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono estaba bien la verdad se miraba impecable llegó rápido .pero al mes dejaron de funcionar las cámaras y el flash así que lo devolví fue dentro de lo que cabe fácil la devolución y me renbolsaron mi dinero .pero es muy recomendable a mi parecer comprar así .la verdad muy contento es bueno tener la confianza de que no vas a perder tu dinero"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Order 3 phones (2 iPhone 12 and 1 iPhone XR) They were in good condition , Only problem was one of the iPhone 12 had an ear speaker problem. Everything else was good."
"Apple","iPhone 12","For calls, apps, photos, everything is perfect. I film videos and the 4k 60fps is the best, crystal clear quality of video I've ever seen. Old digital cameras are dead."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I got my phone like today and I love it so much. I got the black 128gb the battery health is 91% not that bad if you ask me … I love my phone so far and I would purchase this again if I have to.. I recommend this to anyone.. there was no scratches and charges well.. thanks seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I switched from a Samsung S20. There are some features I miss from that phone, but this phone arguably has better face recognition and battery life. It feels great in your hands and the cameras and iOS environment are solid. Not much to complain about honestly."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The “good” quality isn’t so good in my opinion. The phone has a ton of faded paint marks around the sides top and bottom of the phone. I’m not sure if every good quality iPhone is sold like this, but the quality was definitely more deteriorated than I expected. At the same time, the price mark is definitely better than a brand new one."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It showed up faster than expected. It set up faster than expected. It runs twice as fast as my XR. It cost half as much as a new one.What’s not to like?"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just had bought the iPhone 12 renewed premium and this phone seems new to me. I couldn’t find any flaw it had 100% and it works just as new I’m very happy with this iPhone 12"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hi I noticed that on the red iPhone 12 renewed the battery life is at 80%. For as much as they charge for a renewed phone I would think it would be at least 90-95%Otherwise the phone works great and my son is really happy with it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My ancient 6 plus decided last week that it was just too tired to work anymore. I ordered this iphone 12, and I am So happy with it. It will take a few days to get used to the smaller size, but its such an improvement over the old phone. Its in perfect condition, looks brand new, absolutely no scratches. Has a battery life of 93%, which I am very pleased with. Sometimes you wonder about the refurbished items, but for the prices, I will always take a chance on them. The phone is an Amazon Refurbished one, and they are definitely to be trusted."
"Apple","iPhone 12","There was absolutely no scratches or cracks on the phone the screen and glass were perfect.Battery life was at 91%.It was delivered within 2 days and it came with a screen protector and charger.Basically a new phone and I’m very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is the second iPhone I have purchased through Amazon renewed and they both were basically brand new at a fraction of the cost I would have paid at the store. Love love love my new phone. I even purchased a third one for my husband for Christmas ❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came without a scratch & 100% battery life. I'm super impressed. Love love love my new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is a great phone definitely an upgrade from my iPhone XR. Camera is much better and so is the processor. However, I gave it 4 stars because it stated no visible damages, scratches, Etc…noticeable but there are just a few tiny nicks on the sides that I assume are from a case that’s is not so forgiving when taking on and off. Other than that, Nothing noticeable and the battery life is at 94% which is better than I anticipated. The 5g and quickness is also an upgrade. I believe this phone is great for the money spent compared to other prices I’ve seen and I don’t think I’ll be going for the 14 anytime soon."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Day one and very happy with the condition of the phone. It is like brand new. The phone arrived a day early. Very happy so far with what I have used it for today. The seller was excellent to work with and offered to let me contact them should I have any other questions."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Face Recognition, Battery Life and touch screen works absolutely great!!!!! I was a bit afraid at first due to the phone being a refurbished phone but it came in excellent condition looks absolutely new and works perfect!!! I Love It!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’m disappointed in the battery life. I thought the battery would be new. One reason I upgraded my phone was battery. I had a iPhone 7plus. I bought it brand new and the battery was starting to drain fast.I haven’t tried the face recognition yet."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came in fantastic condition. There’s no dings, scratches, or flaws. Works just as brand new. Battery Health is 95% which is great! So far, so good!"

"Apple","iPhone 12","excelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","GREAT PRICE VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The spouse needed a new iPhone to replace the old iPhone 6 SE Apple that won't even update anymore. Years ago we replaced the battery on the old one and it was getting weak again, so it was way past time.I was glad the refurbished unit I received was exactly as described. The battery shows 88% life left, decently over the promised value. I saw minor scratches in the metal but nothing really noticeable. I ordered a case and glass screen protector and you can't even tell it's not brand new.The size of the phone is slightly taller and wider than the old 6 SE, so it seems familiar, but the face of the screen is MUCH larger, making it more usable. It works very similarly to the old phone, except for having no physical home button. The home gestures work easily and the setup had everything PLUS updates making all the old apps work, so the spouse was quite happy.I, too, was happy doing ""tech support,"" because Apple does all the heavy lifting. Just kick off a backup to iCloud on the old phone (in case something goes wrong). When the backup finishes, move the SIM card to the new phone and turn it on. Set the new phone next to the old one, and follow the prompts. The data comes across and much of the setup will be just as expected.I think if you're getting an Apple phone, a recent model certified refurbished phone is a good way to save a bit of money."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Fantastic phone - like new. I have been using it for a while now and had no issues. I would recommend anyone go with this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I love the phone. Works like a champ but the driver delivered it to the building next-door and I had to go retrieve it myself."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Been an android user for years. Switching to the iphone because I'm going overseas. When I opened the box I noticed the phone had some micro blemishes but nothing to get upset about. I was a little surprised that the phone was charged and ready to go out of the box. Nice! Single Sim; accepted my T-Mobile sim card--no issues. Battery Health was 88%! Pretty good but not as high as others mentioned. Overall, the phone works great! Totally satisfied. Going to purchase another one."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I gotta say I was surprised that the phone looked almost brand new, although the color around the camer were stripping off but that was no big deal because I bought camera lens protector to put around it so there was nothing to complain about. The battery health was at 85% which is very good for a good phone, everything worked fine and I am very pleased with my order. So if you’re having 2nd thoughts about buying from HYBRID IT, just buy it because this was a great buy. 😄👍"
"Apple","iPhone 12","CP is not a dual sim phone. Very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The back camera was an illegitimate Apple camera, so I did have to spend some money to replace my camera which sucks, but other than the phone works great.. also my Siri won’t work lol. but I love the phone overall !"
"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone 12 arrived almost fully charged so that was nice, every piece of hardware on the phone worked and passed diagnostic tests. Has a few tiny nicks around the cameras but the screen is flawless. Battery had 87% out of 100% capacity so I’ll have to replace it sooner rather than later, but isn’t a huge deal. Overall a fantastic upgrade from my iPhone SE 2020. The OLED screen is just beautiful.Also, I ended up putting it in a LifeProof Fré, at $80 it’s a pretty penny for a case, but it offers extremely good protection without limiting access to the phone’s functions. Highly recommend both this phone and said phone case."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Works great,a few minor blemishes,wouldn’t read my SIM card so I had to take it to my phone provider and they did an eSIM and it worked great.Smaller than I expected,I had an iPhone 7 Plus and it is quite a bit larger than the regular iPhone 12."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The product came neatly packaged and it was in better condition than I expected for the price"
"Apple","iPhone 12","lo recomiendo 100%, buen estado de la bateria, conserbava su garantia aun por apple, en perfectas condiciones. lo unico esque tardo mucho en llegar. se recomienda al provvedor no enviarlo por usps"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone Works Perfectly Well….Only one scuff n its extremely unnoticeable, also came with a screen protector pre-installed….Amazing value for your money."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Genius purchase here with quality care, detailed attention straightforward approach, and grand design in getting what you pay for, Comes with a year to return, comes completely acceptable as like-new, the item is fully functional and is not in anyway meant to be purchased just for money consumption. I got what I paid for and at a closer price than getting a new product, this like new product is way more acceptable. Grab yours today. Also, keep in mind the GB. Storage is essential. I know my 128 will not fail me, go higher if you are a content creator."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great seller with fast service. Review 48+hours of use: The device works properly well with fast battery charge, the physical condition of the device could be better, I will buy again from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I love this phone! Came with a small dent in the top right corner but it doesn’t affect the phone and it isn’t very visible. I’ve had it for about two months and still not a single problem! Although, at this point in time, I would go buy a brand new one from Apple just because you would be its first owner and you wouldn’t have to worry about any scratches or defects. If you do buy this phone, it isn’t much different from a brand new one."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Overall I’m satisfied thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The refurbished phone was in good shape and still had the glass screen protector. Power adapter and cable were generic, but who doesn't have either of those these days?"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It’s good"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’m so lovely"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything about the phone was fine aside from the earpiece speaker not working and the speakers on the bottom only work half the time. Sometimes they randomly cut to half volume even when it’s turned all the way up. Battery came at 80 something % so not bad."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Pretty much, works like new. Thanks for saving me money!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Bought a acceptable iPhone 12 came in really good condition a little dirt in the speakers and a little scratch and at 87% battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great case. Face recognition excellent. No change to battery life but mag safe makes it easier and quicker to charge battery."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought two phone 12，Battery health was at 90 and 95，everything else is fine so far"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The iPhone works as expected. This was a big upgrade from my previous phone so my expectations were easy to meet. I purchased 1 for myself and one for my wife a month later. My big hang-up with these phone is that they’re misrepresented by the seller/Amazon. These phones aren’t “renewed”, they’re just “used” iPhones. The phones came to me with a chip in the paint on the back, a scratch on the screen, the battery health at 91%, and the charge port full of gunk that caused the charger to not seat properly. All of these issues are fairly minor to me (once I cleaned out the gunk in the charge port), so as far as the phone is concerned, I’m fairly content. I’m mostly just annoyed that Amazon allows sellers to advertise iPhones as “renewed” when they’ve clearly done nothing to renew it. It’s just a used iPhone. If you go in knowing it’s used instead of renewed, you will likely be content with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Recibí el teléfono en perfectas condiciones ,sin un rayón, todo en orden y funcionando perfectamente"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I didn’t expect the phone to come in such excellent condition. Battery at a 100% , not a single scratch or sign of use. I’m happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was like new. Battery Health was 100% and phone was still covered under Apple care for a few months!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life faster than expected"
"Apple","iPhone 12","First time buying a “renewed” phone. I was happy with my iPhone 6+ but the whole world is 5G. Screen size is just an 1/8 of an inch more narrow, but it is almost an inch taller than my 6+."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Every works just fine, and it looks great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","External body like a new.Battery health 89%Camera and sound okScreen with no scratch"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is really good, but my only complaint is that the screen had some small but kinda noticeable scratches on the top of the screen. Everything else was perfect, even the battery was at 100%. I would definitely recommend this phone, if you don't mind a little scratches on the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me gusto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I like the phone. I bought it because it has a Ceramic Shield glass that is 4x better against breaking if dropped.It is a second hand phone and it has a screen protector on it. This was unknown to me.There are 4 marks on the screen protector that bug me.I’m hoping I can remove the protector."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone was fully functional. But it has quite a few scratches. I can withstand the scratches on the back, but it had a couple of scratches on the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 12","llegó en excelente estado a Ecuador, su funcionamiento es excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Got this to give my old phone to someone else and it’s just good as buying a new one, of course the corners came scratched but with a case on you don’t even know. Got it turn on with no problems so it’s unlocked like it says."
"Apple","iPhone 12","There are no scratches or marks on this phone to indicate misuse and the battery measures at 98%. I have only had this phone for a couple of days and so far I’m loving it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life was a little low, but everything else is fine."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Face recognition battery and touch screen all is in good working condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12","the battery health is at 100% there are no scratches and looks brand new i have no complaints!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","SIM removal tool product missing.Phone color fade out near back camera. please checkout images.Requesting to send good condition another phone without any damage."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Good buy, there’s a slight cosmetic damage on the top edge of the phone but it doesn’t show once the case is on, so not a dealbreaker. Battery Health was 100% and lasts long."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Thank you so much for this perfect phone! It came quickly , which I appreciated- but most importantly, the phone is in pristine condition! Literally looks brand new! Not a single scratch, fingerprint, speck of dust- nothing! The battery health capacity is 96%. The set up was easy- although during the iCloud upload, the screen did turn black- I did a hard reset and everything works perfectly again. (quickly press up volume button, then quickly press down volume button, then hold power for 20 seconds until apple icon shows up— and it will reboot as before). Amazing quality and value -thank you so much!! I am so glad that I went with a renewed phone rather than a brand new one from Apple. 💙💙💙 particularly from your company- hybrid IT!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone I received was in nearly perfect condition with 100% battery health, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone freezes at times and glitches but overall I love the color and size of the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Looks brand new purchased a excellent package I am very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Screen was broken. Screen was also faulty. Waste of time to buy this to have to return."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was in great shape but not unlocked for my carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Todo bien con el celular esta en excelentes condiciones esteticas no tiene detalles de uso. Lo unico malo el cable con el que me vino la primera vez que lo use se rompió."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The ear speaker is filthy. Other than that the phone looks like new. Battery life is 91% which isn’t horrible."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My 15 year old son worked this summer to save his money for a new phone. He’s very cheap and doesn’t like to spend money at all lol lol lol. Anyway he decided to get this refurbished phone from Amazon.He got it yesterday and we both were amazed at the condition of it. The phone looks brand new no scratches or anything. It comes with a charging block and cord which a new iPhone doesn’t even come with a charging block.Will update in a few wks on battery life and if we have any issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This thing is practically new. VERY minor scratch but other than that, perfect. Definitely worth the risk to buy refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Bought as a secondary phone for my Galaxy S22 Ultra. I bought Acceptable Condition and the only real wear I see is a few paint chips on the aluminum sides, which you can't see unless looking really close. Battery health at 88%. Also came with a preinstalled screen protector. Ended up taking that off since it messes with the facial recognition.The packaging was quite disappointing. Just came in a USPS small priority box that was damaged, and the phone only had one layer of bubble wrap and was sliding out of it as I opened the box."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I loved this phone it came with a charging cord, fast charging box, screen protector, and pop socket. I bought this phone refurbished in acceptable condition but it looks and feels brand new. 10/10 recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very much like a brand new phone. Everything works and was able to get it set up in about 5 minutes. Only two or three knicks that are very small but understand for a refurbished phone. 100% happy with my order. (Haven’t had it long enough to review the battery life)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Slight signs of use but nothing critical or obvious. The bad part is the battery, but even though it has 82% of max capacity it lasts a lot to run out of battery. I'm very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone itself is great. But the buttons for the power and volume feel stuck most of the time and very hard to turn phone off with and without a case on. I have to press multiple times and forget about taking a snap shot or using the double tap function for wallet."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Well. It’s an iPhone 12. I got what I paid for. A few things though:-The package did not come with a SIM card tool.-The battery health was at 87% when I received it. Not cool.-The phone did, however, come with a free screen protector pre-applied. It wasn’t applied evenly, but hey, at least it’s free.Would buy again for a friend in the end."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is mostly ok. The screen has an issue (there is a small area that looks faded one the sceeen is off, noticeable when screen is on), however, biggest issue and why I gave 3 stars is because the Esim is still locked to AT&T, the previous carrier of the phone. Which means I can never have two numbers in this phone. I will contact Amazon about this and update this review based on their response."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone came fast and it was in excellent condition it only had 1 tiny chip on the top that isn't noticeable, battery health was not the best tho it was at 84%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The shipment came a day earlier and able to use it within minutes of unboxing it. Facetime and everything worked"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Dents and scratches on the phone that wasn't specified."
"Apple","iPhone 12","My battery life is already 80% not good for an “excellent condition “"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything about this phone is good except for the screen. It’s hard to type and scroll through social media. You have to use your entire finger not just the tip. It’s really insensitive."
"Apple","iPhone 12","My granddaughter loves the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This iphone 12 battery health was less than the 90% they say on the product description. The phone also had a very visible ding on both sides of the power button and to top it all, the return process was much worst than other product. Amazon requires UPS to pick up the item at the address where it was delivered and that cost me a day's work."
"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone 12, decent condition. Battery life disappoints, some rashes on the edges but overall decent."
"Apple","iPhone 12","If you’re on a fence about buying a refurbished iPhone don’t be. This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone purchase and it’s totally worth every penny where you’re saving hundreds from other comparable refurbished ones or more than 1/2 of the original new MSRP."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this phone as reconditioned, but it has performed just like it’s new so far. I’m definitely satisfied so far with my iPhone 12."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Received iPhone 12 securely packaged with a new charger and pin to remove sim card. Cosmetically the phone looks great. So far it has been functioning well too. I am hoping this one will last us, our last refurbished phone from a different reseller had issues within a year."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Even though the phone did not show up in an Iphone box, you would never guess it was refurbished. No noticeable flaws at all. Came with charger and cord. Best part is the battery life charges to 100%. I ordered this for my teenager who has been asking for an Iphone. No way could I afford a new one and I refuse to be tied to a network contract. Phone came completely unlocked and my teenager is so happy with everything about the phone. I explained that it most likely would not have a battery that charges completely since that is what is stated per Amazon so we are surprised that the battery charges 100%. The pricing I found to be acceptable after doing pricing research. I will be ordering another one in the near future. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered a refurbished i 12 which looked good on site but finally not very satisfied once in hand.Also price don’t remain competitive ( my bad luck ) as it dropped.So better to go for new n think for later gainsJust my OpinionNo issues with delivery or Amazon 👍🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It came quickly and it works just fine. It was a little weird setting it up but other than that, the battery Life is amazing and everything else is perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone looked as new however, battery health was only 91%. Wish we knew the percentage before purchasing."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It’s alright mine cam with a few scratches on the back and a few on the front. Besides that it’s prefect. It came with a battery health at 91%. I’v had it for 2 months now and have still had no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No Frills, arrived as advertised, phone felt like someone used it for a few months before trading it in for a newer model. Lifelong android user and this was my first iPhone (GSM Carrier). I was able to put my SIM in and my phone was online and working within the hour. Had the phone for a bout a week now and the hardware feels great - I feel confident that the battery is at least at the 80% level that they say it is.If I have to be picky, there is a minor scratch that can only be seen if the phone is held at a sharp angle to the light. There is also some scuff marks on the sides where the phone was potentially rubbing on something. Both of these extremely minor gripes vanish when I put on a screen protector and a phone case.Final Verdict: I'm very happy I made this purchase and it was fantastic value. I got over the ""renewed"" feeling pretty quickly, but I can see how that might bother some people."
"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone 12 is, in my mind, ever since 2020, the gold standard for what a smartphone should be. With a beautiful 6.1"" OLED display, A14 Bionic, good battery life, and a good camera, this iPhone has great value and powerful features."
"Apple","iPhone 12","So the package finally came and in good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Only problem i have with it is the charger it came with really bad quality."
"Apple","iPhone 12","my phone is next to perfect! i found the tiniest scuff near the camera on the back of the phone, but i really had to hunt to find any imperfections at all. battery at 92% and lasts all day with constant use. speaker sounds great. phone calls are clear. very happy with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Genuinely yes this was a great phone saves money just like new saw absolutely nothing wrong with it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","When we first got the phone the wifi and the Bluetooth didn't work.. after several times of resetting tge network. It randomly turned on."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Clearly, this isn’t the best photo of the phone. Sorry about that. What I will say is, there are absolutely no visible damages to this phone- not on the screen, any of the cameras, the sides or edges, and not on the back. The phone operates like new- and in fact, If I bought it without realizing it was renewed, I would have thought it to be brand new. I think perhaps the only thing is that the sound clarity was iffy at first, but that could have just been me because it is absolutely fine now. I wanted to wait the full 90 days before giving an honest review, but so far everything has been fine. The battery life is superb- it is 6:10 PM now and It’s battery is at 75% without charging and with a decent amount of use during today. I really am enjoying the phone so far, however if anything changes, I will probably edit this review.In short, I do believe the purchase was worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","daily use"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone arrived quickly and was good value for the price as I didn’t want to pay full price for a 2 year old phone. However I did order the wrong storage size therefore returned the product."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This was a smooth process and the phone I received is amazing. I highly recommend this company and their product. I bought a “Like new” phone and it is the closest thing to brand new I’ve seen without opening the box for the first time myself. I will be buying my next phone from here"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Stop getting notications and a faulty charger, does not charge properly. I caution anyone who is thinking of getting a refurbished iPhone it's best to pay for a new one. I'm sending my back. Glad these issues manifested its self before the 30 days are up."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I use my phone for pretty much everything and the battery isn’t bad it does go a bit faster if your using it all day but that’s any phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Product is in very good shape except for a few minor scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered a renewed and unlocked iPhone 12 with 128 GB of storage from Amazon. I wanted to try one out (my previous smartphones except for my first one were all Androids). I also wanted the flexibility of paying the phone off when I wanted to instead of being stuck on a ""forever"" installment plan. Buying this phone was a great decision. I love my iPhone. If you're worried that a renewed iPhone won't be as good as a brand new iPhone, don't be. The front of the phone is in pristine shape. The glass on the front has no scratches whatsoever. The back has very few (and I literally mean very few) scratches. You can't see them from arm's length like the listing says. You can barely see them unless you hold it up to a light. The sides of the phone are in perfect shape too. It makes calls, send texts and messages normally. The camera is in perfect shape and takes amazing pictures too. This model of the renewed iPhone costs about 50 bucks less than a brand new one with the same storage. If you're looking for a good value on an iPhone or a replacement phone for a family member then I'd consider a renewed iPhone. Its a winning decision."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hybrid IT is awesome.Phone was delivers within 24 hours of ordering it. Battery life was @95%. Recommend this seller again. Will purchase from them again for sure. I wish I could give them more that 5 stars. They deserve 10 stars ⭐️"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The I phone 12 arrived quickly but was poorly packed. It was delivered loosely in a bubble sleeve in a box in a plastic mailing envelope. The sleeve was inadequate to keep the phone from rattling around inside the box. The phone was listed as excellent, same as new, but the phone had noticeable scratches on the top area of the screen. Other than those two gripes, the phone otherwise was in excellent shape and was able to be initialized properly. After staring at the screen scratches for a few hours, I decided to return the phone, at my own expense."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It looked fine from the packaging but when i started to use it I quickly noticed the flaws. Cant even recognize my sim card nor run cellular network connection. My device doesnt connect to cellular network!!! Like cmon! I wish i could get my money back but i cant! 1 star!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy buen producto vida útil de la batería al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It worked right away, I’m not entirely used to IPhones so I did have a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to use it. Now that it’s been nearly a month since I bought it, it works fantastic, the storage is great and I didn’t even notice any superficial damage like the product says it does. Honestly, I’d recommend if you want an IPhone but are hesitant, believe me I get you, I’m certain you can trust this."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The battery dies really fast. Last night it totally shut off and I couldn’t turn it back on. That was frustrating. But finally got it working again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Iphone 12 arrived on time and in excellent conditions. No scratches on the screen. Battery life runs all day for a teenager boy, so it's a good signal."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone functions properly I received mine with 89% battery life there is a pretty deep scratch on the screen but overall decent price for the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was hoping a better battery life since I choose the ""excellent"" condition, also I still can see scratches around the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Product arrived one day early, only couple small marks in the screen but overall it's better than I expected. A+"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Dosent work with boost mobile 😡"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was skeptical at first since it was refurbished I was more worried about battery life, well no problem at all! No one can even tell it was refurbished unless I tell them! I love thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El celular es totalmente funcional. Las peladuras y rasguños son casi imperceptibles. Los parlantes venían un poco sucios. Por todo lo demás está muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Apple genuine parts and fast shipping, I love my new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone has a 90% battery health it does't come with 100% as I would have like, but it works like a new one. No scrathes. I though it is a good purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El Telefono funciona como nuevo y parece nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Shipping didn’t take long. Works perfect i purchased an iphone 12+ at store and had so many issues and havent had a single problem since we received it nothing everything works good."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very good product, battery life 96%, worth"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My iphone came quickly and there was no damage to the phone. It even came with a charger, which is super nice. The only thing was the battery wouldn't charge, however after hard resetting the iphone it has had no problem charging, and battery life lasts all day:) here is how to hard reset an iphone if anyone else needs to do it: press the volume up and then the volume down button very fast. Immediately after hold the power button. I'm very happy I chose to purchase through amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Came fast, worked good only a few small scratches in the side metal."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The product looked brand new and in perfect condition. We’ve had it a couple of weeks and it came in perfect working order. So happy to have bought it from this seller! Thank you SO much! We couldn’t be more pleased with the product, delivery time, or the entire experience."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came in early, was in great condition and had 100% Battery!! A few minor scratches on back but with a case you’ll never know. Excellent purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I would recommend anyone looking for a quality iphone at an unbeatable price to go with this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I always get worried when i see refurbished in the title, but this time i decided to go for it since it was a great prime day deal, and it came 1 day sooner. I got the Iphone 12 green and i was amazed that it looks brand new with only 2 minor scratches on the back. Thats no problem since its going to have a phone case. Overall its a great buy."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I have had the phone for a few months now, and I haven’t had a since issues with it. Would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excellent purchase, just a minor scratch on the phone but everything else works perfect. Battery condition at 86%. 100% would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Read deal"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This product was incredibly good"

"Apple","iPhone 12","perfect condition, & 100% battery. couldn't be happier with Amazon!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No problems, looks great, works great. Glad that I bought it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Product came on time and works perfectly! Don’t usually buy phones online but this was perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is Amazing everything is perfect just that when it was delivered, UPS delivered to the wrong address. Thanks god the person who lives there went to my house and give it to me. Just be careful!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","All features work perfectly and the housing is in excellent, near new condition. There was one very small knick at the top but was covered by the phone case. Overall a great buy as I was able to save over $200 unlocked and battery life was 90%."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life 89%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Unlike some vendors, this phone came on time, packaged correctly and looked exactly as advertised. I do not purchase cell phones regularly, but I would buy from this vendor again!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Si"
"Apple","iPhone 12","When it arrived it was completely like new, 0 signs of use, and 89% battery health. Face Id works great, everything seems awesome. I'm very impressed, and I look foward to using this phone more in the future"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Would recommend all the negative comments are strange because mine was just fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It’s a iPhone, not much to say, it works"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Wonderful phone beautiful. Mint condition not scratches runs perfect out of the box so far. It's been only a few days and no used it on a regular basis yet but impressive so far"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came with a broken ear speaker. For some reason, neither of the speakers were inspected according to the Amazon Renewed ""20-Point Inspection Test Certificate"". There is visible damage to the ear speaker as per the photo attached. These parts should also be tested. The phone cannot be used as a conventional phone with this broken critical part. I will be returning this phone; very disappointing.Edit: (Adjusted from 1 to 3 stars) Immediately after returning the phone, I purchased an identical one. I’ve had it for about 6 months and it works great with no issues. No damage, scratches or other wear. The phone is fast and battery is normal. When it comes to used items like this, it’s a gamble. Thankfully there is a return policy when you get a bad apple."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Honestly, for $200 off this is a steal. Battery came at 90% health, no scratches that I can find, clean screen, great face recognition. The only way I could tell that it was used was the charging port had a really small amount of dust. Otherwise would’ve never known it was used."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’ve had this refurbished phone for a couple of months now. It arrived in great condition- the only noticeable flaw was a small scratch on the screen. Works like new and was easy to set up with Verizon."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone purchase was GREAT! Price was reasonable, phone is AMAZING and literally perfect! No issues, even received it earlier than anticipated."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything works top notch. Face ID, screen , everything! I had no problems at all with these. It has a few scratches on the corners a top and bottom one but for the most part in great condition. Loveeee the color it’s amazing! It also came with a screen protector… which im very greatful for !"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I liked it very well"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Charging cable not working, it does not charge the phone. Went to service center and they said, charging cable is not appropriate to charge the phone, i need to buy another one. My only question to seller, why they do this kind of cheap work, where they gave a faulty charging cable. Would not recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12","My phone came with a little dent on the top right but other than that it is perfect. Don’t even notice it because I have a case on."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The clarity of the picture on the phone amazed me"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone came in great condition. The only thing was the battery health was in the mid 80s like around 85%. Otherwise, great buy."

Super easy. No visible damage on the device and everything seems to be working well. Happy with this purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No supero mis expectativas como lo había hecho en otras ocasiones."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I understand that the device is used I was prepared to have scratches and cosmetic defects but not software functionality issues the face recognition sometimes fail even after using it to unlock phone a few seconds ago the evidence gets frozen (I do have storage I use to work on phones) secondly the battery percentage was way too close to servicing next thing is the device also delays on boot up or turning screen on or offered"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Have to make calls on either speaker or with AirPods in :("
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered this phone as fully unlocked. When I received it I quickly realized that the sim was locked by Verizon. Luckily I was able to find a website that unlocked it online for around $40 instead of having to send it back. Not to happy I had to spend an additional $40. Other than that good phone 👍"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Very good product....battery is 97%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Amazing quality definitely recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was a little afraid their would be a lot of scratches since this is my first time getting a renewed device and I was honestly surprised. Also if you get the T-Mobile version it will work with T-Mobile owned places like metropcs. Mine came literally with no scratches, it was also well packaged. The battery does last a while and charges fast too. I recommend getting a separate charging block but the charger that does come with is good. I’m satisfied with my purchase and not disappointed :)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12"," I love it"

"Apple","iPhone 12","As promised, there were no visible scratches on the phone, it looks brand new and it was packaged with care"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great phone but I removed the screen protector because the touch screen was slow and I discovered some scratches on the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente servicio y producto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Nice phone, but I could not get the thing to pair with my hearing aids without the need to purchase a $300. dollar accessory. Most android phones have this issue.
I had to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Exactly as described. Excellent pre-owned condition. Best iPhone I’ve ever owned."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Amazing quality as it should but the fact that the camera lense bezel spins is what made me give it 4 stars should I return it or naw"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery health was at 85%😒"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life was at 100%. Looks basically brand new with no noticeable cracks or scratches. Good experience overall."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Buen estado, bun funcionamiento y bateria al 90 %, recomendado 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Came with 100% battery life but price went down $50 since my purchase 😟"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Mine came with the buttons broken.. The only way I can turn the phone on is if I pressed the power button super hard.. it also came with 0%.. honestly felt like returning it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The frame had dirty spots on it and the charger and speaker ports were dirty"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Purchased this phone, everything works except couple things, the microphone for talking on the phone was very quiet and the battery maximum life was only at 82%, had to go to the apple store and get both those things fixed for an extra expense."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 12","X"
"Apple","iPhone 12","So fair, phone works fine. But I'm a bit disappointed by the condition of the phone. The sides are scratched and worn."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I like the phone. But I spent a considerable extra amount to get the platinum or whatever it was so that I could get a phone with 90% battery capacity. Upon arrival it had 87% battery capacity. I know it seems like a small thing but when you buy a product with a guarantee and then upgrade it and spend more, you really should expect what you’re buying is right."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Came in two days sooner than expected, came with 80% charge and works amazingly! been looking to upgrade my phone to a new one at a reasonable price. didnt want to spend $1000 on a brand new phone! Found this one and decided to buy it based on reviews. so happy i did!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Wasn't as I expected."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Got the phone for my mom when hers iPhone x broke. This iPhone functions but she was pretty bummed out about the corners having some deep scratches and dings. For the price inwas hoping for less signs of wear."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I honestly have never ordered a phone on Amazon before because I was always a little skeptical but these guys delivered the phone came with 90% battery life and it’s like new with just a few minor scratches on the outside aluminum 10/10 would buy again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I own an iPhone 12. I bought one for my Dad and paid extra for the premium refurbished. I expected it to be like new (as described). The buttons don’t give any click feedback like mine do, but do function. The biggest problem is the speaker appears to be broken. Although the external speaker works, it is much quieter than my iPhone, noticeably so. I’m surprised that the quality check didn’t pick this up. It was easy to return, but a let down nonetheless."
"Apple","iPhone 12","For a iPhone that is like $600 buy it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excellent conditions as described. No problems with the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this and it came in perfect condition, no scratches at all. The battery is 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Description says the phone is refurbished, and honestly I just was looking for an iPhone to use alongside my Android phone. I actually love this phone, and it was cheaper to buy it here than Apple itself. Phone is fully functional and has 0 cracks or scratches. Well worth the money!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I really don’t like leaving bad reviews but I’ve spent too much money on this phone not to. Firstly, all of the issues I have with this product could have been easily avoided if the seller was a little more careful. It appears as though the screen was changed. Which is fine. BUT the camera lens was apparently smudged before the screen was reapplied resulting in terrible front cam photos. This could have been eailsy avoided if he cleaned the lens before. Which unfortunately it’s too late to do. That’s 1. Secondly, the LCD has spots in 2 separate places, it appears as though the screen was damaged when applying it and they just sold it like that. I’m really disappointed in this product. I thought I was purchasing an ‘almost new’ phone but instead it’s an iPhone from WISH."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life is good, there’s not visible scratches and phone works great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Apple sells a brand new, yes brand new iphone 12 at the time of this purchase for $699. This will be new with a full 1 year warranty, plus option to extend to a second year. This item sells for $539, used, scratched up, don't know what it's been through, and comes with a 3 month warranty from Amazon ""renewed"". I think Amazon is genuinely trying to do good here, but these third party vendors are not living up to their end. I received a supposedly ""like new"" iphone 12, and it came with more than 11 cuts on the screen, 3 deep, 4 medium, and 4 other significant cuts easily visible. I just don't know what these vendors are doing, wasting time, resources sending these phones back and forth. Amazon needs to better enforce the standard for phone condition better. The back and forth is not good for the environment, or time, all of which in short supply. I Cannot recommend this seller, at all."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I just ordered this. Now I wont know what exactly will be in the box or what percentage the battery is at. I will update soon with what I get with it.

Update:

With renewed phones from here, if you don't like it you can get a different one. If it ends up having a tiny scratch, you can get a new one. Obviously not really new but renewed. You have 90 days to swap or get a refund. Sure it doesn't come with the iPhone box or original accessories but its not like you keep the box. In fact these come with charging block, BUT this is lightning to usb not usb-c. Still a great option. If you were like me and wondering if you should get a 12 mini to save money but are worried about how small it is Id still get the 12. I came from a 7 plus so it still feels small. Again 100% recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I love it I works fine didn’t come with any cracks at all amazing condition 🥳🥳"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Funciona muy bien el reconocimiento facial la vida útil de la batería me tocó al 88% es muy aceptable muy buena inversión comparando el precio con sudamérica el celular está como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery heath is at 88% and seems to go down pretty fast. Faster than what 88% health should be draining.

Check if the phone is actually unlocked or not. Because the phone I got was locked. Even though the description says UNLOCKED”. It was worse due to me leaving the country and only finding it out then, and also I had bought screen protector and a case, which are now useless."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Se ve y funciona de maravilla apresar de ser renovado, solo un detalle que el cargador y el cable son genéricos, se recomienda comprar los originales ya que estos pueden afectar y dañar el celular a la larga"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente producto"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy buen producto. Solo faltaron los audífonos"
"Apple","iPhone 12","For $500, include a charger with the same specs as what originally comes with the phone. The subpar $0.10 1A USB-A charger from 2015 it came with would take 12+ hours to charge an iPhone 12 that's turned off, NEVER if turned on. It went straight in the trash."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything looked good with it. 5 months later it constantly shuts off and wont update. I mean i hoped id get more than 5 months for $1000"
"Apple","iPhone 12","They must not check there phone befor resale the speaker on this phone don’t even work"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The battery life does not last long and the screen is sluggish when using it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything is perfect on the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Iphone12 died 95 days after purchase of $630.18. Was kept in otter box in my purse. Was never dropped, gotten wet, left in car or outside. Just died overnight in my purse in my dining room on 0ctober 27/28th. Warranty/ return was October 21, 2022. Im a disabled senior and the only way I could afford is with Amazons 12 month same as cash payment plan. Took to 2 repair places and phone no good.
Amazon contacted suupplytronic they replied twice with exact same message: past warranty date and take fr repair! Which I previously told them I had taken to repair! So,help what so ever from them!
I’ve purchased 4 refurnished phones and a IPad for Amazon and they are all working find to this day! Will try Amazon again and will never purchase anything from supplytronics again😒😣😠"

When I inquired further on what that meant they said the device shows as inventory in another store location. The phone it self was in good condition but can't really provide an honest review for the device received"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Bought this for my partner and was thrilled to be able to get the purple she preferred for under $800. Delivered on the first of the delivery window in like new condition. The only problem she had connecting the phone to her service was actually an error on T-Mobile’s end when they cancelled her old SIM instead of transferring. Supervisor said it was new hire🤷🏻."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No visual signs of wear. Very happy with purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone came wiped to factory setting but had a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) installed from the IT department of Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although they are software to by-pass MDM the phone was worthless to me. I took the phone to my local Apple Store and the tech stated that the MDM can only be removed by DHS. I was unable to upgrade my Iphone 8 to this Iphone 12. Once I restart the phone the MDM would come up asking for a DHS login and password. Worthless."

I had no problems connecting to a provider and really like the design as well; not a fan of red, but satisfied. I would buy from this seller again..keep up the good work."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Al ser renewed premium me hubiese gustado que a lo mejor si traiga el 100% de batería. Del resto excelente compra."

"Apple","iPhone 12","My iPhone had no apparent cosmetic scratches, or imperfections. In the package was a third party charger and plug. Battery life was 100%. Next day shipping. Great buy."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is a review of an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12. I’ve had good luck w/ Amazon renewed products before, up until now. I purchased an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12 256GB model from Avant Solutions. I paid almost $700 for it, so I was fully expecting it to be in good condition. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an item that just does not meet Amazon Renewed product criteria of “no visible imperfections at arms length.”. First off, the aluminum trim around the edge had a very visible scrape, which turned out to be more than cosmetic; it was dented in, and caused a bulge that I could feel when I ran my finger over the area. That packaging was fine, so it was clearly not shipping related damage - so obviously there was not very good quality control on the part of the vendor. I did not even bother setting up the phone b/c I want to return it, but because it was not purchased directly from Amazon, the return process seems to be a bit more time consuming and difficult. After this experience, I would be more inclined to purchase renewed products sold and shipped directly from Amazon, rather than from a 3rd party vendor."
"Apple","iPhone 12","What can I say? It's an iPhone. Love the new face recognition with mask on feature and improved camera. Upgraded from an XR. So far, so good."
"Apple","iPhone 12","So after much debate I decided to get my RENEWED IPhone 12. I could not be more pleased! It’s only been 12 hours but so easy to switch from my 2021 SE. There’s not one sign of any defects cosmetically or operating.
Very happy!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My son loves this phone. It has all the bells and whistles for an affordable price. The picture quality is amazing. For a renewed phone, it works like brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Price went down $14 right after I bought it. I don’t like the screen size."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone did not come unlocked. Had to pay $100 to get unlocked and it’s still not fully unlocked to any carrier"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Everythings smooth"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Ningun rallon, tuve la suerte de 100% de bateria, como nuevo el telefono :)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","first time i get an iphone. face recognition works fine, love i can use face recognition to save passwords. battery runs out too fast, phone gets very hot after 15 min of charging i dont know why. phone charge wont pass 97% for some reason. phone i received was reconditioned but was pretty banged up on the sides and glass protector that came glued on the phone started to slowly peel off from the sides two days after i received it. phone works great so i give this 3 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just received my renewed phone, seems to be working good so far - interestingly i ordered a blue one but received a white one so i was a little worried it wouldn't be the right one for my carrier but it was, thank goodness."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Personal use THis was ordered for me and I would have preferred a new phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The mobile did not come well checked. The screen was not real and did not last a day. On the same day of turning on the mobile, the screen has paid itself all the time until the mobile stopped working. The truth is that I bought the cell phone because I needed it to be able to work with it that week and I couldn't do it. Now I'm in the process of refunding, to see how it goes. For the next time, I hope that the telephone numbers are checked very well before sending them, please, so that this does not happen again."

"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone reliability and iOS updates for years to come"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this phone for someone outside USA. Unfortunately calls work only on loud speaker which we dint realize during initial set up. This is a major issue and it literally makes the phone unusable. I tried to contact the business for return or replacement but they have a no return/ replacement policy when taken outside USA. The worst part of it all is when I checked Apple for IPhone 12, it is available almost for the same price. Not sure why I went through all the trouble for getting this phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Can't really write much more than to say it wouldn't make it past the setup screens. Everytime I tried to 'select country' the phone froze and went back to the lock screen. Complete waste of time, Amazon support was pretty useless and after a few minutes they referred me to the Apple customer service website."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came in looking great, but the batteries were not 80%, from a full charge i spoke on the phone for approx 45 mins, and battery was half drained.. now gonna cost me at least $50 per phone plus install fee.., for two new batteries..not happy"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Love when a renewed product arrives as advertised, earlier than expected, 100% maximum capacity battery and a screen protector pre-installed on the device.The speedy shipping was a very pleasant surprise, as was the inclusion of the screen protector.Device arrived in pristine condition too. Fantastic experience thus far, would buy from again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very fast shipping. Great so far"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I have used different sim (T-Mobile, lycamobile and AT&T) but iPhone unable to select the network. Even I trued manual selection , I didn’t work. Rebooted multiple time , no use. I have requested for refundLet’s see the response.I did more research on the ICCID number, it says Unknow, it means it is defective or phone is locked.As per the product description, it is unlocked phone. Seller is not paying for the return shipment which is one more disappointment"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I just opened my package today & it looked like this. I already used the charger for my other phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Honestly I buy a phone for it’s ability provide certain things one of which is the ability to talk to people and for them to clearly hear me with this phone in particular I needed it prior to a trip to assure I have a way to contact my family as I safely travel cross country HOWEVER this phones audio quality on BOTH ends his horrible I can only assume this is due to the fact it is in fact a refurbished phone however when one pays such a steep price for a phone you hope to get at the very least the basics. I will not be recommending this phone or seller to anyone until my issue is resolved as this is unacceptable.Edit: I removed the screen protector applied to the phone when i purchased it and under it found HUGE scratches to the glass!!! Is this a joke? I was told this was renewed not disguised."
"Apple","iPhone 12","the cost of the phone is very high, it looks good, they put a protector on it so that you don't notice how scratched the screen is... it's remarkable"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It came in decent conditions but the scratch on the screen upset my girlfriend a lot"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just loved overall very happy"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The fact that they overly advertise the product. Yes it was clean without scratches but the battery? Yeah that was done for. From the moment I got the phone it was dead and never charged I had to go get it fixed myself instead of waiting for a refund"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me llegó hoy, esta muy bien cuidado, todo 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery 87%, the screen was of poor quality and it has cosmetic damage. I returned the cellphone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything I need/want in a phone. camera is exceptional, change over from earlier phone was easy. hope to have this phone for several years."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Although this device does not come in the original it was in tip top shape. After thorough inspection, there were no scratches what so ever. Not even microscratches. Very satisfied with the quality of the refurbish."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life was terrible upon receipt. They sell these phones for a high price based on an almost-new sales pitch. But straight out of the box, the battery only lasted a few hours. I call BS.Never again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone came looking brand new! No scratches, dents or breaks and the battery health was at 100%. It is a bit pricey for a refurbished version but it also got to my house in less than 2 days. Apple said it would take 2 weeks."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very satified with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Workinh just fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Fully unlocked. Worked immediately with my sim. No scratches. Like new."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Love the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought one for myself in June and one in December for my girlfriends daughter. No issues. I don’t know where these horror stories are coming from."
"Apple","iPhone 12","For a product sold as 'Excellent condition - renewed', this arrived with very visible scratches and dents on the body and a malfunctioning screen already giving errors. Seems like it was not handled well by technicians, has low quality aftermarket parts and is being passed off as excellent - I'd say good at best. Wouldn't recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Paid $460 dollars for a phone that was fraudulent! It was a off brand phone in iPhone case. It was CRACKED and it screen didn't work and all u could hear was a woman speaking some language I couldn't even identify. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Al recibirlo, el telefono no sube el brillo. Se reinicia solo y luego no se puede bajar el brillo. Panralla apenas se puede ver. Ya se reviso toda la configuracion y no es ese el problema."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very good quality! Just like new!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This a good phone , it’s basically brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone constantly says no service. It has done this since phone was received and connected. I thought it was the service provider so I switched services and it is still doing it. I have tried everything that google says to fix it and nothing has worked. Not sure if I was sent a defective phone or what. Unsatisfied with product."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Product work perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This was listed as an unlocked phone, it isn’t. After I set up my phone and downloaded my info from the cloud it wouldn’t accept my SIM card because it’s locked."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Mi niña le encanto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compre el celular para abotárgame algo de dinero, pero tuve que cambiarle la pieza que lee el chip, como lo pedí para otro país ya no pude devolverlo, a la final gaste lo mismo que habría gastado por un celular nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No son celulares refurbished, son celulares usados como dijeron en otro comentario. Compré el mío en “excelentes condiciones” pero tiene arañazos y golpes en varios puntos del celular. Lo peor es que vino sucio en el auricular, speakers y con manchas de grasa en la pantalla. Es q decir que ni siquiera se molestaron en limpiarlo, por eso se nota q no es refurbished. No vale su precio. Inviertan un poco más y mejor cómprense uno nuevo con batería al 100%. Es lo q debí haber hecho."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No tiene ni rasguños y funciona perfectamente. Recomiendo la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The speaker is low and muffled, and needs to be replaced. It should have been caught and fixed by the original seller, but they missed it. Now I have to spend more money to get it fixed."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone looked great and worked perfectly but it was still a bad phone because it came blacklisted meaning whoever previously owned the phone reported it lost or stolen so I couldn’t get it turned on with my carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very happy with the product."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Not premium condition! Battery was only at 85% health. Premium price guaranteed minimum of 90% Battery health! Be careful when ordering premium and paying extra. There is no special support or service."
"Apple","iPhone 12","LOVED EVERYTHING"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Worth buying phone looks brand new very much renewed I’m very satisfied with my purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Really like the new design with the iPhone 12."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I contacted the company a day after the phone arrived with my issues and their only response was ""does it have a screen protector on it?"" I would not recommend purchasing refurbished from this company. Regardless of the condition ordered."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Title"
"Apple","iPhone 12","When the phone showed up I unboxed it and when I turned it on it had a green screen and started flickering. I was able to return it minus 18.48 of the full price for some reason. Probably won’t be doing business with them again."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This iphone cannot stay connected to my carrier (sprint, now tmobile) for more than 10 minutes. I've had it for 2 days and for maybe 2 hours TOTAL, I have had cellular signal. It randomly connects and disconnects. I was using it as a GPS today and it went blank on me. This is my hometown where i always have had signal with iphones and my carriers. I spoke with apple support and they confirmed that I was sold a faulty device and that this ""pre owned"" process amazon has is a JOKE. They do not inspect these devices fully. and You have a HUGE chance of getting a faulty device. My device looks fine from the outside. No scratches or smudges. But unless you have wifi, this device is nothing for you. Im stuck with a glorified ipod touch at this point. I cannot make calls or use this phone outside my house, period. This was my first and last order with amazon renewed services. Do yourself a favor and get a new one or get one from anywhere but amazon's preowned services. amazon preowned department is a bunch of monkeys pretending to know what a working phone is"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Not bad"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Touch screen top section non responsive in less than 1 month light use. No replacement option and even Amazon could not contact the seller. Returning to Amazon for a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The whole iPhone except the screen was full of scratches and also the button to turn off and on does not work well, which is what I meant I listed you did not list it on a site that has all these issues, and because of these issues I return it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I went to T-mobile and they said the phone is locked and cannot recognize tmobile cell towers. Very disappointing since the description says it is compatible."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very good product as described and expected. Very robust and easy to use and configure."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Not yet evaluated"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone was frozen at the point when setting up where you chose your country. It froze to the point where you could not turn the phone off. You could not go forward. The device is USELESS. Buyer Beware!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 I want my money back if I can not reboot and fix it. When I opened it just says hello and when I swipe up just saw a white screen like what the heck I spent over $400 for this. Get me a new phone with no charge."
"Apple","iPhone 12"," I want my money back if I can not reboot and fix it. When I opened it just says hello and when I swipe up just saw a white screen like what the heck I spent over $400 for this. Get me a new phone with no charge."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This ""renewed"" iPhone was far from being in an excellent condition as described. The battery is more than halfway worn out with less than 90% of its capacity remaining. The battery has to be replaced at 80% capacity, and once you cross 90%, the deterioration accelerates, so this phone will need to be cracked open for an expensive repair in a few months. The phone was also dirty and scratched. Finally, the box it came in was crushed and in poor condition. I'm very disappointed in Amazon's Synergy ""renewed"" phones and would have to recommend that you stay away from them."
"Apple","iPhone 12","La pantalla estaba maltratada y la vida de la batería no vale la pena"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I dislike that the phone cut on and off like 3 times and then took like 20 to 30 mins to cut back on and the fourth time is when it completely cut off and didn’t work anymore like I want a refund"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This was the best gift to myself item is in great condition no regrets. Great seller I would recommend them to anyone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Arrived just as described. Second iPhone ordered from Amazon."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is not going to work for me. I need to return it and order another one soon before I leave for my vacation."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hasta el momento el teléfono llena mis expectativas, el
Producto vino bien embalado, bien protegido y y al momento que lo estaba como lo había pedido"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It's ""like a new iPhone"" but just a bit less reliable. If I plug the charger in it freezes the screen so then I have to turn the screen ON/OFF a few times to get the touch screen working again. It's not a massive issue but it's an inconvenience. You get what you pay for :)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The iPhone was perfect! In fact, three months later, I’m writing this review on it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I have purchased 3 iPhones in the past three months for family members and two out of the 3 were damaged. This iPhone 12 had the button glued shut. They physically did not press or click or worked at all. I also ordered and iPhone 11 Pro Max which had the wifi not work (Literally greyed out and disabled) and yes I did every single recovery, reset and including DFU Reset. Idk who are the Block heads that's ""Inspecting"" and ""Testing"" these phones but they are so obviously broken I highly doubt anyone is doing any type of testing. Furthermore, the returns are outrageous. 30+ day for ""Return Processing"" Plus another 7-14 days for the money to be returned to your account. 40+ days waiting for a refund on a phone that came damaged and was shipped out literally the same day."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone will not get texts from Android phone called Apple they could not solve problems called our network and they could not solve problem. And tried different things it said to try on you tube and internet."
"Apple","iPhone 12","en la pantalla indica que el respuestao no es orginital, la camara terrible, LAMENTABLEMENTE yo vivo en Guatemala y me sale muy caro mandarlo a devolver, pero fue muy mala compra"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is an apple 12 Mini , I was surprised"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It was great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The product shipped quickly and was in very good condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The iPhone is great it's almost like brand new and I would totally recommend it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this phone on the quicks to replace my old Iphone 7+ that broke, it says in the description that this phone comes fully unlocked and everything, my sim card isn’t working at all, i can’t get no types of service, it literally says i have no service even when my service is completely active, i had to order a replacement sim because i thought my old sim wasn’t working, turns out it’s just this phone 🥲 , this is so frustrating cuz i love this phone and everything but i just want to be able to make calls and use my phone without wifi, i could’ve just went and bought this for the full price off apple and been using my service. this is so upsetting"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone broke on me in 3 months got it fix and it never started working right again. What a waste of money would never buy a refurbished phone again. I contacted the seller and they weren’t able to do a thing for me and I was just ignored for a few days right before my warranty ended"
"Apple","iPhone 12","this phone was absolute garbage. i would give ZERO stars. the screen was replaced and every time you tapped it make dots on the screen. there was a permanent dot in the display, it would not read my sim card, considering the screen had been replaced you would expect no scratches. there were SCRATCHES EVERYWHERE. horrible buy. a waste of $500. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS POS!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery health 100%, very pleased"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Product is in excellent condition, battery was fully charge, no marks on screen or case."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Love my iPhone . Received it promptly and it appears to be new. I got my information transferred and it so much better than my former iPhone . I would recommend this product to my family and friends."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I think this iPhone comes as one as new as far I haven’t noticed any imperfections or signs of used phone. Totally in good condition almost mint"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The item is in good condition and come early"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone I have had problems from the first day. I will not power off and cord wasn't good. I have been trying to get in apple app. I can't get in to my apps at at all. I have called my phone carrier. But phone isn't quite up to par."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Flawless"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery life lasts me all day since I do use my phone for work at Publix . It’s easy to login to all my accounts with face recognition and it came tempered glass screen protector best thing ever"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me gusto porque estaba en muy buen estado como indicaron en la descripcion"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Screen went blank after 3 months. Took it to Apple store. They said the screen was damaged and repair was not done properly leading to moister buildup. Total garbage. Don't buy from here."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was using an IPhone 6 so you can only imagine the joy I had when this started working for me all set up. Came exactly how I wanted it to"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Damage product with a lots of scratches. very bad quality. What a waste of time and money."
"Apple","iPhone 12","good condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this phone, bought a case and screen protectors and a wireless charger to go with it, and then discovered when I put my SIM card in that it was locked. Now I have to decide if I want to try again and hope I get an unlocked phone this time, or pay twice as much for a new phone. Ugh."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Awesome phone! Battery life was 100% when I got it and it’s like brand new condition. It also came with an adapter which Apple does not give you!!! Also a sim injection tool, and free pop socket! Great deal for $60 less than Apple!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’ve had this phone for 3 weeks now and the battery health has already gone down to 97% which is not normal for an iPhone 12. Especially if I’ve only had it for 3 weeks. I have to pay $100 to get the battery replaced now. Not worth your money."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No dings or scratches, even has a screen protector. Battery at 87% capacity, other than that, the phone is perfect.update - this phone is sim locked. The description says Fully Unlocked (Renewed)."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was looking a refurbished iPhone. So far this phone works great, there was no sign of scratch or anything. The phone came with screen protector."
"Apple","iPhone 12","PHONE WAS REPORTED STOLEN & IS UNUSABLE WASTE OF MONEY JUST GET BRAND NEW"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I would strongly advise a friend away from buying a renewed iphone. I ordered the 12, and will be returning it. The screen sensitivity is terrible. does not respond even as well as my 3 year old iphone6. Faulty hardware or software bug i guess. Has been a big headache for me."
"Apple","iPhone 12","My phone came dirty with glue residue all over the phone, the camera quality is bad and it would not let me log into my Apple ID . Also the price is ridiculous you can buy a BRAND NEW iPhone 12 from apple themselves for only 599 this isn’t worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone was dirty when I got it. It was almost like someone took a phone case off of it and then threw it in a box and sent it to me. All the speakers were visibly dirty. Functionally it worked great until I tried to make a call. The ear speaker did not work at all. I could use speaker phone and the speaker for music worked wonderfully. Also, the facial recognition only worked about half the time. Most the time I had to put in the pin to open it. This would have been my first apple phone in over a decade so I don't know if this would have gotten better if I rescanned my face or not because I only had the phone for a day. The return went very smoothly though and for that I give the company props."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compré este iPhone en junio y ahora ya no funciona solo duro 5 meses"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Good is in good condition but the battery life is not good."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No issues what so ever with the phone the battery is in great condition housing is in great shape screen 👌🏽Perfect so no issues what so ever with the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","They sold me a phone owned by the Department of Homeland Security. The phone is bricked and the only way to use it is by entering your DHS credentials. Obviously they never even turned the phone on to check if it is functioning."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Order the phone so I can send to my dad in Jamaica. I bring the phone with me to Jamaica so I can give. after he received it he said that he can only use the phone on speaker. So many starches and the phone was so dirty. The battery life at 88%. This iPhone is no good and I spent so much money for it. Now my dad have to pay someone to get the phone fix. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!! WHY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR A GARBAGE PHONE. AND THEY SEND ME THE WRONG COLOR. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Not worth for this price. Condition is good not excellent. Disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 12","i am going to return it not working right very disappointed"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It came with three scratches and heats up a bit. The battery life is ok but could die slower"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It didn’t come in the original box but it did come with a charger cable and a screen protector and it works great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I do love the phone I order on here it’s very clean and amazing.. definitely recommend others to buy.. price was good also 👍🏾"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Refurbished is the way to go. Works like new with a cheaper price."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Making phone calls and cancelling robo calls."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The front camera doesn’t work 95% of the time."
"Apple","iPhone 12","When I took this in to get added to my plan, my service company stated it was reported as ""lost or stolen"" from the serial number. Couldn't use it, even though it was unlocked. Phone in and of itself was great, and in fantastic condition, but The fact that it was probably sold illegally...yeah you only get one star, if that."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Like new.. i mean it. These guys packed it nicely, added a nice charger, a screen shield and even a backup. Perfect condition. Perfect battery. Perfect seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very unsatisfied. Took as a gift to India. Unnoticed the condition when arrived. Screen had a significant Crack. Phone came with screen guard. Guess used to cover crack. I suggest never buy conditioned phones. Spent more and get new one. Not worth it. Sorry."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No me lo entregaron con caja, y tiene alginos pequeños rallones en la parte de atraz, fuera de eso parece que el telefono esta super bien"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Batterylife can not be rated at this time"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Great photo quality. Fast processing speed. Like the facial recognition. Quality product."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Worked well"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Has worked great for about 5 months now"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I do not recommend this equipment is terrible.- mine arrived with signs of misuse and bumps on all corners.- scratched never use it.- I returned it to the store.it's garbage.is a scam I stole 50 percent in the return . IS ESTAFFFAAAAAA"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Received Device 7/22/22: Color was not “RED” as noted?? Itwas a “corral pink”?? When I initially turned device “On” A large green vertical line appeared on “Display”! Restarted device, same results, green vertical line?? Continued to setup device thinking the green line may go away! Then unable to connect to WI-FI ? Returned item 7/23/22 via UPS.. will not buy Refurbished??? iphone Again…this experience (leaves alot to be desired)…"
"Apple","iPhone 12","el celular esta demasiado viejo , tiene arañones, la vida util de la bateria 80%, pague 500 dolares por un celular que no debe valer mas de 200"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought the phone and it came with 89% battery health. Pretty decent I would say. After finishing all the process and downloading the software update, I tried to play music just to check the speaker. The speaker was tearing up. When I called someone I couldn't hear them while on the hands-on phone calling and very low voice while on speaker.It says certified but still got a defective product. Returning it on the first day."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It’s okay but not worth the money I paid for it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone simply does not work. It came with issues from the get go. The screen and surroundings has dents in it like it has been dropped and mis treated. When i tried to set up the phone it will go from a black screen with a scroll wheel in the center to the home screen, back to the black screen. There is no way to make this phone work. We have spent all day researching online how to do a factory reset, but the phone wont even allow you to do that! Very frustrating and very annoyed."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone is in good quality except for one little scratch on the back. Battery health came at 100%. Runs smooth no problems. Came unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Warning do not buy from Cellular Resource. Was so exicited! Everything was ok except some minor blemishes. But when the phone had no sound when trying to talk to someone, I knew I bought a lemon. I hope they send me a new one or I will be going somewhere else…… These guys actually repackaged the same defective cell phone and sent back to me. I was stupid enough to give them one more chance and try next phone was 64 gig instead of 128 gig. These guys are terrible and I will be filing a complaint about them with the Better Business Burea. Unless your idiot do not buy from the Cellular Resource."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone arrived in inadequate packaging to protect the phone. There was nothing to cushion the phone or protect it from rough treatment in transit.When I tried to use the phone, it worked only long enough to load all my personal information and then went black. Despite many attempts to charge it, retart it, etc., it will not turn on or operate. Very frustrating. The phone is clearly not functional."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Worst purchase I’ve ever made. This iPhone is junk. The speaker doesn’t work, the touch screen isn’t calibrated right, and the screen will dim/brighten for no particular reason.I have purchased iPhones from Amazon in the past and have had great experiences therefore had no reservations on purchasing another one from Amazon but now I wish I would have went a different route."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I am NOT happy at all because this reported itself as stolen. Accordingly, when I took it in to be activated, it rejected the chip You might think the reseller would check that out BRFORE offering it to customers"
"Apple","iPhone 12","everything was in order, took to phone store to activate a new sim card 5.00 bucks"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was described as excellent condition. I received a dirty scratched phone in fair/good condition. I’m frustrated by electronic resellers being so shady. Don’t buy, I don’t even trust the phone authenticity."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was nervous due to mix reviews , but my phone works and looks great. No scratches or anything. Perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12","After 3 weeks of use it had stopped working"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I love it. The battery life is amazing lasts me from 7 in the morning till 9 at night. Very pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 12","It came with 2 minor scratches on the rim of the phone but otherwise it’s great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered this phone and it arrived over 2 weeks late. When I took it to Metro PCS to have it activated they informed me it wasn't unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone didn’t work. Thankfully, Apple replaced it. However, it cost me $32.00"
"Apple","iPhone 12","99 days after receipt of the phone, the screen went out. Contacted the seller and was informed that it was past their 90 obligation and that they would not fix or replace it. Buyer beware, defective products and a company undeserving of your business."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I really like it! I obviously dont dislike anything about the phone since..it is the phone i was looking for."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Everything is good, my battery life is on 82 percent is my problem. My iPhone 11 I have had since they came out is on 83. I wouldn’t care if it was at like 90 but 82 will only last a few hours. I don’t want to wait another week for a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone wasn't charging ans batter life die so fast"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 I ordered two for me and my spouse and we love them the shipping was fast and they’re beautiful no problems at all"
"Apple","iPhone 12"," I ordered two for me and my spouse and we love them the shipping was fast and they’re beautiful no problems at all"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Be aware you gonna pay to return if you don’t like it. I got a great condition and it came with a scratch and had to pay to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Screen was damager. It use to turn pink every single time."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I purchased an iPhone 12 from the seller. The device's Ear Speaker was not fully functional, which made it very difficult to hear the other person speaking on phone calls. It sounded like they were speaking from way out in the distance. In addition, when watching videos using speakerphone, the volume output from the Ear Speaker side was soft and a light internal rattle could be heard. Phone was returned!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was supposed to be unlocked. It was not. I was unable to activate. Had to reset to factory and return."
"Apple","iPhone 12","What a rip off, refurbished is too expensive considering I got an inferior scratched product, it was in my possession for 2 minutes when I saw the damaged screen, never even turned it on so don't know if it worked. Insult to injury I had to pay shipping costs to return! What a waste of time and money, I will buy new only."
"Apple","iPhone 12","First thing I noticed right out of the box was that it was very dirty. The speaker that goes up to your ear is very dirty and I had to clean it. There was a ring of grime around where the case went around the charging port as well. However the thing that is making me return it is the speakers sound like they’ve gotten water in them at some point. They’re very dull, almost to the point where the alarm didn’t wake me up. Listening to music or tik toks without headphones really accentuated the problem.

When I paid the price that was almost the same as buying a new phone, I expected better quality than this."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’m guessing this was B grade. This phone was hiding 3 scratches under the screen protector"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Has a lot of scratches and has a bad battery life dont but this."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Bought this renewed I phone. 5 months later the phone says locked to owner with the original purchasers icloud account. This company can't supply an original purchase receipt to unlock the phone with Apple and won't return or exchange the phone. $700 paperweight. Buyers beware."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Came just in time for my vacation. Works great! No complaints about the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","todo de acuerodo a las especificaciones, muy conforme"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Almost brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just a regular iPhone, nothing special. Nothing wrong with the one I got, so that's great."
"Apple","iPhone 12","When it came out of the box it looked brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought an iphone 12 and after 3 month the battery stoped working, and since it was off the 90 days policy, they told me that now it is my problems and they cant do nothing about it, i wish this didnt happend to me."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is a total waste of money! A piece of junk! In less than a week , the touch screen is hanging!! Seller is not the best; after several back and forth, he wouldn't offer exchange:(. I will have to return and wait for refund. A TOTAL DISASTER!! SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY-KEEP OFF!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","item did not come unlocked, wasn’t compatible with my sim, said it was locked by the carrier, unusable"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just transferee my data to my iPhone 12 I just purchased from here now my screen black. No matter how much I hit the button it stays black but when I unplug it and plug it back in it makes a noise, if I can’t get it to work I want a refund UPDATED!! It works! I had to hit the top volume button then the bottom and then held the power button for 10 secs and it’s all good WHEW! If this happens to anyone else, try this it’ll automatically restart!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Defective item don’t buy from this seller, volume button isn’t working"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Nice phones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I mistakenly bought 2 phones with the hope that we wouldn’t get defective products. Boy, was I wrong. Took these in same day to our provider only to find out that not just one, but BOTH are sim locked. Without knowing the previous provider, we’re SOL. I started a return immediately after finding out that they can’t be used. This product is 100% a scam. If you decide to purchase these, don’t expect them to be unlocked. Just buy new so you know you’re getting exactly what you’re supposed to."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone came broken, paint scratched, overheating, and camera was shattered."

"Apple","iPhone 12","the phone reeks of lithium"
"Apple","iPhone 12","So far it's perfect 100% battery health like brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Do not buy from this company. The battery they installed in their refurbished IPhone is not a legitimate IPhone battery and we’re getting warnings constantly about the battery. If you want a decent IPhone, buy from someone else. This company does not stand by its products"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Perfecto estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Scratches on the bezel were clearly visible even at arms length. In addition, I couldn't make a call with it. I got the message: ""Call Failed"" every time. My SP and I worked for over 30 minutes after a new SIM was inserted. No dice."
"Apple","iPhone 12","this phone had a crack when i got it and its been in an otter box never been dropped since i got it and the crack on the back is getting worse."

"Apple","iPhone 12","I have always owned new IPhones the past 15 years or so and this is my first reference one and it’s not great. The Touch screen doesn't work always and people can’t hear me 1/2 the time I will only buy brand new in future."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Only purchased this one because it was supposed to be fully unlocked and it wasnt and it was dinged up pretty bad. Now I have to wait for the money to credit after Avant processes the returned phone. It was a birthday present for someone else and I should have just gone to get a brand new one at a store."
"Apple","iPhone 12","iPhone stopped working. Jo return. No refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12","it was in excellent condition with battery health at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I thought this was a great buy; like new but used. There were a few minor blemishes. However, I could not transfer my data and apps from my other iPhone. It also could not be recognized in my iTunes app. So I quickly returned it the next day."
"Apple","iPhone 12","So far so good"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Exelente en todo, hasta tenía protector de cristal integrado"

"Apple","iPhone 12","So far no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I ordered the phone option specifically for AT&T because they are my current service provider & I hoped that I wouldn’t have an issues with it being unlocked. Well, after speaking with apple twice & AT&T twice and taking the phone into AT&T, they said it was broken (unable to officially state the issue but said something on the inside must be physically broken) so I would not recommend buying one of the these phones because I still had to purchase a new iPhone. I also used a coupon on the phone that I don’t think I can get back so very unsatisfied with this purchase."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Fully functional and reliable purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Didn’t work at all and I ordered the phone twice. The imei number was still locked when I bought it. Amazon should do more due diligence when it comes to third party vendors. I’m really disappointed with Amazon."

"Apple","iPhone 12","The iPhone arrived with the screen broken and I couldn’t event turn it on. BE CAREFUL AFTER TWO WEEKS THAY HAVENT REFUND THE MONEY. SO I LOST THE PHONE AND THE MONEY!!! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Speaker doesn't work so I can't even face time. Called and was told the seller would send a label for me to return it, it's been a month and I never got it. So you're really gambling if you buy it from this shady person."

"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone was scratched and came in a bad cardboard box with an android charger and the camera didn't work I couldn't charge it and it was such bad quality definitely known as refurbished this was the worst experience ever. It wouldn't connect with my carrier and for 700$ I was mad as all can get out please please save your money and don't buy this piece of junk."

"Apple","iPhone 12","My son paid for this phone, and we knew it was renewed (not new). It completely stopped working less than 6 months after purchase. Apple wants almost $500 just to see if they can fix it. This was not a positive experience."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Received phone. Went to put in service with our carrier today and they identified the phone was still locked in with another service provider. Nothing our provider could do. Immediately sent a message but received a reply that I “should” have a reply by the 23rd. Not acceptable. Overall rating may go up depending on how this issue is resolved."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono lleva varias horas pegado, no se puede instalar el Software 15.1.1 cuando lo inicie por primera vez, lo compre y lo mande a un casillero para mandármelo a Costa Rica y esta totalmente pegado como muerto, llevo muchas hora con el teléfono inservible.

"Apple","iPhone 12","This is definitely not the quality I expected"

If you know how to fix it can you please help a girl out. I would really appreciate it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The display is amazing, very clear and durable. The battery life is for medium users, so 4-5 hours per day."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Amazon says the phone is 100% unlocked and I received a phone locked into a carrier. If I wanted to buy a locked phone, I would have went to the store physically. If you’re like me and want an unlocked phone DO NOT buy this one. Thumbs down double thumbs down"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I Order it unlocked just for it not to work with my sims card not a good business"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone was a gift and advertised as refurbished. When we took it into our wireless carrier to activate it, we where shown several marks on the outside edge, a small chip in the screen and a slightly dirty charge port. Our wireless carrier said that if it is advertised as refurbished it is supposed to be like new. We didn't fully unpack the phone until we got to our provider because my daughter didn't want anything to happen to it before it was activated and put in a protective case."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was so ready to refund my money back after reading the reviews but I must say I am PLEASED great job, Battery life is immaculate, no scratches or anything I love it!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No lo duden , es perfecto y con garantía."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I had the iPhone XR, upgraded to the 12, and I don’t notice any difference at all. What I did notice, though, is that the battery on the 12 is not impressive. It actually seems that it drains almost the same as my XR drained with only 92% of battery capacity remaining. The poor battery life was one of the reasons I decided to upgrade.The display and the camera on the 12 may be better than the XR, however, it’s absolutely not noticeable, at all. I also notice absolutely zero difference with the 5G.That being said, it is still an iPhone, so of course it’s still a decent phone, it’s just that for a new phone, I expect it to be noticeably better than the last one, which it’s just not, and the poor battery life actually makes it a worse phone, to me.I guess it depends on which phone you’re upgrading from. I went from the 6 to the XR, to the 12. Going from the 6 to the XR was great, but, going from the XR, or any other similar model, to the 12- is not necessary, and, like I said, the battery is awful.I should also mention that the 12 doesn’t include a power adapter or EarPods. It only comes with a charger cord that won’t fit the previous wall adapters, so if you want to use it, you have to purchase a USB C Power Adapter. That’s crappy, too.I’m sorry I got this iPhone 12, and wish I would have at least waited for the next one to come out. Total waste of money!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","As my eyes have aged, reading on a small screen has become more difficult. My old 6 plus had a relatively large screen which made reading easy. The 12 is both shorter and narrower. I am not willing to pay for a 12 Pro Max which is bigger.This is an Accessibility issue that affects millions of iPhone users. Apple could make the model 12 in different sizes with little effort.Another solution would be for all news apps to support rotating the screen. Their text length then would be more reasonable with the slightly larger print that I need."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I didn't expected to receive damaged/strached screen on Refurbished items"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No issues with my phone! You'd never know that it was renewed. Very happy with my purchase and this seller. 10/10!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This is by far the WORST iPhone I’ve ever had! Terrible battery life ( I charge at least twice a day). The reception is sometimes sketchy and it drops calls constantly. The 5G only is good in areas where towers have been upgraded. Wish I could return it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","A new Iphone 12 is $20 more! That’s all!! Why buy renewed??"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Just received the phone one week after being ordered. So far looks good. Everything looks in place and it doesn’t seem like a scam lol. The battery life looks good and everything."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Liked the overall quality, sharp pictures and long battery life."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is like brand new! Battery life is 86% but I don’t mind. It lasts 12 hours perfect for me. Love it and the price was great! It’s brand new so the price was perfect! I definitely recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Well, it's an iPhone 12. It works properly without any issues. Transferred my iPhone details without any issues as well. I can confirm it is unlocked and can be used with any cell phone service provider. Shipped properly without any issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Similar to my I-phone 7 Plus, so easy to switch over. Still working on the face recognition feature. I hope the battery life is as good as my 7 Plus, it was great until just recently. It was time for a newer version!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The shipping was fast and the phone is like it's brand new straight from the store. Zero scratches or defects. It came unlocked so I just put in my son's Cricket chip and the phone works amazingly. Good price for a nice device!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Was sceptical at first but once I got it, it WAS unlocked and was in beautiful condition! My bf loves it and it’s pretty much new! Wouldn’t know the difference!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The reconditioned unit is like new and was a snap to set-up. It transferred all data from my Iphone 6 without a problem."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Purchased this as a work phone replacement, NO scratched, battery life is great, came with cable and wall brick. Overall a great purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery dies fast, face recognition works sometimes and the charging port only works with certain chargers definitely needs improvement or lower the value of the phone because it’s not worth no where near a grand."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Totally my fault, phone was great just had to return due to it not having enough storage."
"Apple","iPhone 12","So far so Good! Phone came looking like brand new! No trouble activating or switching info. Fingers crossed!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Been using it for almost an year now no problem works great"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was in perfect condition! It worked flawlessly on T-Mobile transferring over from my old iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Love the phone came as described with no issues"
"Apple","iPhone 12","So I was very skeptical at first about buying a refurbished phone but I was pleasantly surprised how good it was and ready to go! everything transferred over perfectly just be patient it takes some time to move all of the data especially if you have a bunch of photos to move."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I admit I was a bit skeptical about buying a renewed phone but I got my iPhone today and I couldn’t be any more happier!! Absolutely love it. No scratches or blemishes whatsoever. It’s functioning smoothly so far. Thank you Amazon!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Enhancement of the previous six were much smaller and functional but still looks the same with a enlarged pixel gripper like this one"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Sent an 11 when ordered a 12. After getting sims, number, and service they wanted me to send it back and be without a phone. Wouldn’t discount for the difference either. Volume buttons won’t stay at adjustment. Lock button won’t always work."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought the iPhone 12 from Refurb Supply Source. The phone was delivered in two days, and came in like-new condition with 100% maximum battery capacity. I have been using the phone for 2 days now, and there have been no signs of it being a used/refurbished phone. Works like new. Very pleased!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Recibi mi teléfono en perfectas condiciones, para haber sido un teléfono reacondicionado esta en perfecto estado. recibí mi teléfono en Venezuela . Me encanto. Lo recomiendo y espero sirva de ayuda a muchos este comentario, ni un rayón, y la batería al 100%"

"Apple","iPhone 12","I expected the worse as i’ve never ordered an refurbished device off amazon , so when i get this good looking phone with 95% battery health it blew me away . great buy ."
"Apple","iPhone 12","For what it’s worth this was a really good buy. No headphones included, not that I cared, but my partner did. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Just throwing that info out there."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone came in perfect condition and works good as new! I’ve had it for a few days now and everything works perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es un producto que llega en óptimas condiciones casi como nuevo excelente"

"Apple","iPhone 12","If the listing didn't say it was renewed, I wouldn't know. No scratches at all, battery is at 100% capacity and shockingly, I received a [third-party] charging adapter! More value for less money than a new iPhone :)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I am shocked at the great condition that the phone is in being refurbished as well as the high battery life. This is my second phone purchased from this company over the last few years and they both have been great."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El tlf llegó sin detalle de estética, loCompre en la opción que dice como nuevo y así está.La batería carga sin problema y ha tenido duración."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I got this phone at 86% battery health . Everything is perfect otherwise"

"Apple","iPhone 12","The newest IPhone. It feels good in the hand. It has boxed off sides. Face recognition works. I am pleased so far."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 The camera quality is great and was worth the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12"," The camera quality is great and was worth the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I spend so much money on this phone and from the beginning the wifi and bluetooth never would turn on. Now the phone keeps resetting randomly meaning idk when it will just shut off on me and for how long. This was meant to be in new condition but it had scratches on it but not something I really cared about. I just wanted a normal phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery 98%, perfect for a refurbished item. Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Son loves this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It is a bit hard to open the screen, have to swipe in just the right spot"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I always feel like I’m taking a chance buying “refurbished” electronics but the prices on the new iPhones have led me to do this twice. And I’m glad I did! This phone arrived early, perfectly packaged, and included a charging cable and cube and a sim chip remover. The phone is in perfect condition with not even a tiny scratch to be seen. I’ve been using it for several days now and it works great. Battery life on arrival was 98%—awesome! The only odd thing I noticed is about the Amazon listing. The price is fluctuating a lot. One day the phone was $519, still a reasonable price, but the next it was $420. So perhaps you want to keep an eye on that and time your purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I don't have any problem with everything is good only one thing it didn't have was that the key was missing to put the sim but everything is good."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Como nuevo Perfecto estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","When I bought this cell phone the title said “EXCELLENT CONDITION”, the product is good, but with problem hiding by the seller. Unfortunately this seller not respect Amazon policy about this kind of product. Is not enough to send the best cell phone that he has, he need respect the condition as was reported"
"Apple","iPhone 12","love it

compering to my frinds iphone 11 this is lot better"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excellent phone recommend
I will buy again 😊😊😊"
"Apple","iPhone 12","-Phone has no 3.5mm jack
-No wall charger is included in the box
-Constantly and incessantly asks for Apple ID password, over and over, at random times, locking the Apple ID account without warning, notice, or reason, requiring email verified unlocks. One of the most frustrating user experiences I've ever had.
-iTunes sync consistently fails to synchronize songs added, despite them showing up in iTunes and syncing. No warnings were displayed at all. This isn't helped by the fact that it's impossible to sort songs by date added in the music program. Wow.

Unacceptable failures in design that, by 2022, should have been ironed out years ago. Oh, and the notch is annoying and hurts the design.

3/5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone it’s an horrible condition a lot of scratches and terrible battery life the worst experience ever I’m not happy with my purchase Please guys spend your money somewhere else That phone Not worth even one third of the price"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This used iphone has an acceptable condition but was marked as an excellent condition. Fortunately it was selling at a price of good condition I think. There are some obvious scratches on the screen and sides. The charging adapter doesn’t work. The battery health status shows 93%. It’s ok."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery capacity is 89%. I wish it had a higher capacity, but it is okay for me to use anyway. Everything else was fine."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy contento por las condiciones en las que me enviaron este equipo. Impecable. Buen rendimiento de batería. Genial"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Super nice like new iPhone. Comes with a pin too. A couple of dollars off can get you a cup of coffee!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","phone is cool. but I will return it. I wanted to take for myself and my wife. but found a cheaper price. but in general, take it, you will not regret it"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Countless scratches on the back and bumps around the corners.
Not even cleaned, let along ""renewed"". Totally a rip off.
Can't wait to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone arrived and appeared to be in pristine condition. Took it to T-Mobile to have it set up as my old phone. I should mention this replaced the exact same phone which I owned before I lost it. Anyhow, battery life on my two year old iPhone 12 was significantly better than the battery on this phone. They advertise 80% battery life but I don’t think that’s, a fact something to think about if you order one of these. I turn on my low power mode immediately in the morning at 100% and still need to charge this phone before the end of the day."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought my wife a gift and this was it. Buying something used always comes with its pros and cons. Overall the phone was great other than a little nick at the bottoms right if the screen and low battery health. The phone operates and normal overall."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Much better than my previous iPhone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was debating between the mini and regular, and I’m pretty happy that I decided to go with the regular one. Works great!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone was a perfect upgrade from my XR. Face recognition is easy to use and reliable. Easy set up after transferring what I needed. This was as advertised and worth the price. I am happy with this phone and would buy again from this seller if needed."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I recently got one, I can't complain, the phone is brand new-like (clean) except for some few scratches on the side buttons but since I got it with the case is not even noticeable.I like it 😁😁"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was forced to upgrade, I’m happy I did!! This phone works great. The battery life is great, it lasts all day. I’m still discovering things I can do on this device."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’ve had it for a while now and I love it. It works really well."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I purchase an iphone 12 64GB renewed premium. Phone was like brand new and I couldnt tell it was used. The battery had 93% capacity was the only indication that it was not new. The phone came packaged in a Amazon Renewed Premium box and with a generic white charger, lightening cable and sim tray removal tool. I set up with US Mobile Super LTE sim and everything is working good so far."
"Apple","iPhone 12","All in all, it's good. 5-star for it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","I had checked up this iPhone and I expected a regular version and not a mini but it’s what I got. It has accepted my old sim from ATnT which I am happy with. I’m also happy that the iPhone was placed in my mailbox. Amazon has been losing my packages by their people leaving them at wrong doors so I was very stressed that I was going to lose my phone. So for that, you get a five star from me. Thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This was a gift"
"Apple","iPhone 12","It was a perfect gift for mu daughter"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The camera works excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone is like a 100% new phone!The quality is great. No scratchesBattery is 100%Phone guarantee is until Oct 24, 2021I can use Vietnamese sim card by this phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Setisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I am thrilled with this purchase. The phone is in pristine condition. Has great battery life and takes great photos. Also, came with glass protector. Experienced no problems in set up and has been working fine. I would most definitely purchase again when the time comes."
"Apple","iPhone 12","You all need to stop complaining about scratches ,dents and no brick or earphones..I bought my iPhone mini brand new from Apple store and I love it.They don’t come with a brick or earphones brand new threw Apple .I bought a iPhone XR threw Amazon and loved it.I also understood it was renewed and it isn’t going to be prefect like new iPhone that was never used.if you want new go to Apple and buy new.Now the phone not being unlocked is a real reason to be refunded because they didn’t get what they paid for.It would be an expensive paper weight.Now no brick or he’d phones also complaining about it not being in a org box stop complaining.As I said new iPhone from Apple only included the lighting charging cord ,information and sim tool,that’s it,no brick or headphones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I bought this iPhone due to the fact that it was 100$ cheaper than the original sold by apple. I’ve bought phones on Amazon in the past and have had no issue with them. However, when this phone came in the mail it was different. The phone turned on and functioned all right, but I soon noticed that it would restart over and over in a span of a 30 min use. This made the phone unusable. I went into the settings and found the warranty from the previous owner. Luckily, it was still under warranty. I took it to the shop and they had to basically replace the entire phone. I was really disappointed that I was sold a broken product. :("
"Apple","iPhone 12","For some reason, the phone settings had it set up so that pictures adjusted to appear as their negatives when displayed, but if sceenshots were taken of them, they appeared normal. We had to contact apple support to figure out how to adjust this setting."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Personal phone international please😊"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is in like-new condition, no sign of used at all; only without original packaging or accessories, while not really any interesting accessories coming with original new one from Apple any more. Great item, very satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone was for my daughter. She loves it! The battery is much better than expected. She is very pleased with the camera. Great pictures. Well pleased with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The phone is good everything working perfectly"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I was a little concerned when I first started setting the phone up and it wouldn’t charge normally. It was plugged in for 4 hours and only got to 40%. I tried my old charger and it worked like a charm. The one they sent with the phone was shot. But- that’s the only down side and it’s not a big deal. The phone looks perfect, holds a charge very well, works like it came straight from Apple! I’m very happy with my purchase!! Five stars!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","La peor estafa por un producto en muy mala condiciones pantalla rota u cubierta con un vidrio templado para disimular es mi peor compra en este sitio wed"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I’m pleasantly surprised. The phone is in almost perfect condition. It really is “like new”. It is working great so far. It also came with a screen protector, which I appreciate. If you’re unsure, just go for it! I was extremely skeptical at first because this was my first time buying a phone online but I did it and I do not regret it. Totally worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Phone is in great shape and is working well. Had to get a different SIM card from ATT, as the iPhone 6 had a much larger SIM card, but we’re up and running with no issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Cumple con lo que es la publicacion del producto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Works perfectly fine and very affordable. Came in with a screen protector on and with charger."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Really great phone seems like brand new. Brand new battery. I’ve been heavily using this phone for the past month no complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Awesome beautiful (color Red) iphone 12! Battery life was 100% when I got it and it’s like brand new condition. It also came with a charger. Super fast 2 day shipping. This is my second iphone purchase from Amazon first phone was a iphone7 - and have received great phones both times."
"Apple","iPhone 12","buen producto gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The product works very well. The battery life is not so different than from previous versions. The device heats up every now and then when charging."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Estaba como nuevo , me encanto , funciona a la perfección"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Very satisfied!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Overall its as good as new. It doesn't come with an original box but I was well aware of that. Decent charger usb A to lightning. I was really happy with the 100% battery health. No damage on the body AT ALL. There's a very tiny scratch on the top right of the screen but it's barely noticeable. I'm thinking of buying it again for my dad. Really happy with the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12","i was very scared reading the reviews after i bought the phone. the phone came in perfect. no visible scratches , everything works, it's unlocked. do it !!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Si bien esta bueno, pues el producto es un Iphone de alta calidad, la condicion en que lo entregaron no es la esperada. Tiene golpes en las esquinas, aunque compre la version ""condición excelente"" y la batería me vino al 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Battery is 100%, the body is perfect and the screen have a small scrat on the superior part, but it's very superficial.For a renewed iPhone deserves a 5 star."
"Apple","iPhone 12","This phone came in very good condition, however the one downside was that the phone had a 86% maximum capacity. There was some very minor scratches but that most likely happened in shipping, however they were very unnoticeable. It also was a little damaged one part, but then again this is a refurbished iPhone so for what I payed it was absolutely perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Delivered earlier, well packed, in excellent condition, the seller put a fast charge and a good quality cable, very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12"," Delivered earlier, well packed, in excellent condition, the seller put a fast charge and a good quality cable, very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12","My review is dedicated exclusively to the item (blue mobile restored to excellent).
In no way, I agree, that, this item restored to excellent level, you will not see details at less than an arm's length.
The item (mobile) that I received is not the case.
More than a restored mobile, I am sure that it is a used mobile, because it still has, very visible, the marks of a case, which was used previously.
It has many large details, visible at much more than an arm's length, scratches and bumps.
(photo 1 and 2) marks left by the previously used case.
(photo 3) Deep scratch on upper left corner, very visible.
(photo 4) Scratches on upper left corner, very visible.
(photo 5) Deep and visible scratch on lower left edge.
(photo 6) Start button without paint, worn from use.
(photo 7) Volume buttons, unpainted, worn from use.
(photo 8) no paint, worn from use back glass with crack, above the camera.
On the other hand, its operation, after 1 week of being tested, is correct, I hope that at least this remains so, since in terms of aesthetics, this is not the item I expected to receive"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I purchased the product on August 25th, and today October 16th midnight my girlfriend decided to changed the screen protector because the one that came with the phone makes a lot of finger prints, so once my girlfriend removed (it was actually a gift for my girlfriend) she noticed that there were several scratches on the screen that we didn't notice when we purchased the product ( I can't share pictures of it because we work on a cruise ship and the internet sucks on the open sea so I only can barely write reviews and purchases) I'm writing this now because we just noticed and in the product review said that the screen doesn't have scratches. I hope you guys be more honest with the description of your products next time so customers don't get this surprises after a month of purchase. I hope you can read my review. Thanks"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono llegó con muy buena estética y sin rayones y en el color solicitado. Batería al 90%. Lleva apenas unos días de uso, pero no ha habido problemas. El cable y cargador funcionan bien, pero por la calidad supongo que no durarán mucho."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Renovado premium es la opción."

la señal esta muy bien agarra perfectamente para TELCEL"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Me gusto que llego impecable, solo con una muy pequeña abolladura en el marco de metal, la pantalla integra sin ningún raspón, la parte trasera como nueva. La batería 83% por ello le doy 4 estrellas. Tal vez podría bajar un poco más el precio."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Cumple con lo que necesito"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono llegó nuevo, un pequeño golpe pero nada grave"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me encanta comprar en Amazon si llegaran a tener algún problema solo piden que le regresen el producto y le manden otro, la verdad es que es un producto excelente y aun tiene AppleCare"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Vi que muchos venían con rayones en la pantalla pero no fue mi caso, sólo traía unos pequeños golpes en la esquina del iPhone y en el borde de la camará pero son casi IMPERCEPTIBLES, la batería tenía 89%, todo totalmente bien, muy feliz con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Todo bien, llego justo el día seleccionado, la pila afortunadamente quedo al 100%, estéticamente no tiene nada, parece nuevo.

Obviamente llego en una caja genérica con cargador genérico pero de por si ese modelo dejo de traer cargador, hasta me convino hahaha, recomendado."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es lo que queria, satisfecho con mi compra."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Dude al comprarlo por algunas reseñas que leía pero me sorprendí por la estética que tenía, todo funciona al 100, cámaras, bocinas, touch, todo Perfecto, solo por el apartado de la batería que me llego al 88% pero aún así muy bien."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compré este iPhone a un muy buen precio, tiene una estética muy buena, solo mínimos rayones en la pantalla, mismos que me percaté de ellos una vez le cambié la mica que traía.
Trajo un porcentaje de pila de 91%
El cargador y cable con el que viene, pese a que son genéricos, carga muy rápido.
De momento va de maravilla, espero que perduré. Es hermoso!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El precio me pareció estupendo. El equipo viene en muy buen estado, tiene solo un pequeñísimo rayón en la pantalla pero casi no se nota, todo lo demás súper bien. La batería está en 87%. Funciona perfecto. Súper recomendable estos equipos relación precio y estado del mismo."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo llegó muy bien e indica que la batería tiene un 100% de capacidad. El tiempo de entrega fue bueno y llegó con una mica preinstalada, cable y cargador."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No me gusto que el volumen es demasiado bajo aún cuando se a ti a el altavoz debe uno a ver pegarse el cel al oído para escucharlo quizás está al 40% el volumen comprado a otro dispositivo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","En mi caso el teléfono vino en caja genérica y con cargador genérico (que ya es ganancia porque el teléfono no lo trae de fábrica). El estado de mi pila es excelente (100%). Tiene un ligero raspón en la parte superior pero con una funda se tapa."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Llego en perfecto estado a pesar de ser Reacondicionado, primer equipo que compro y sin problema."
"Apple","iPhone 12","me encanto el teléfono, no trae ningún detalle físico , lo único que me desagrado fue la batería de tan solo del 87%.
lo recomiendo."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente producto, estética y batería"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono me llegó con un 100% de batería, obviamente la reemplazaron pero en el teléfono no marca ninguna advertencia que esta sea chafa, así que me supongo que debe ser la original.
Analizando a consciencia el teléfono mediante Utools no arroja ninguna advertencia.
100% satisfecho con la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono vino con 88% de batería hubiera preferido arriba del 90% pero está muy bien, solo tiene 2 detalles de los cuales solo 1 es realmente visible y con una funda no se ve ninguno, venia algo sucio pero nada del otro mundo, con cables de segunda mano pero de calidad decente,

El único contratiempo es que veo 2 rayones en la pantalla, fuera de eso excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hasta ahorita no heteido problema con el producto, siento que es nuevo y se ve prometedor, hasta este momento le doy 10/10 al vendedor y a las públicacion pues me llegó lo que esperaba"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Lo agarré como 2mil pesos menos de lo que regularmente cuesta. Llegó a tiempo, un par de raspones que se pueden cubrir con una funda sin ningún problema y batería al 100%, una chulada. BuySpry excelente vendedor."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy buen producto, es la primera vez que compro un Producto renew y se encuentra en condiciones impecables"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Equipo sin detalles estéticos, solo el rendimiento de la pila es del 88%. Me hubiera gustado que en la reseña del producto se mencionara el detalle de la pila."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Esta perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","La batería viene al 96 lo cual por calidad precio se me hace muy bien, y viene con algunos rayones en la pantalla pero compensa que trae una mica, todo lo demás funciona perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","I really, really wanted and iPhone, but I certainly didn’t want to spend over $1000 on the new iPhone 13 or even an older 12. Since the Apple Canada store NEVER has refurbished iPhones in stock, I decided to look at Amazon Refurbished. The reviews weren’t great, but I figured I could return it if it turned out to be bogus.

I got the phone, and I was pretty impressed. I inspected it under bright daylight - not a single scratch, dent, or ding. Nothing. The phone was physically flawless, apart from a bit of dirt in the mute switch (easily cleaned). The battery was at 88%, which was pretty good.

The phone set up perfectly fine without issue. I tested everything - wireless radios, cameras, speakers, microphones, sensors. Checked for screen discolouration/burn. Again, everything was perfect.

I’ve been using it for the past month without issue. I think it’s safe to say that very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous when purchasing, and I’ll admit to having low expectations. It seems that this particular phone was cared for by the first owner, and was cleaned up nicely by the seller. I bought mine from Alpha Wireless CA.

So yes, I have heard the horror stories from others buying Amazon Refurbished, but if you’re careful and do it right, you might get a good one like I did. TIP: Always order from listings which say Amazon handles the shipping - that gives you the regular Amazon 30-day window, PLUS whatever other warranty the Amazon Refurbished program provides."
"Apple","iPhone 12","La estética de 10, traía un pequeñísimo rasguño casi imperceptible al rededor de una de las cámaras, la batería con el 90%, el cargador la verdad si se ve bastante genérico y de igual manera te llega en una caja genérica, lo tuve que devolver porque la batería se calentaba mucho al usar ciertas apps como al ver las historias de IG o al cargarlo (lo cargué con un carga rápida original), también la bocina se escuchaba mal, como si estuviera “reventada” o se la hubieran cambiado y no fuera la original, tengo otro iPhone 12 en casa y no pasa eso, por eso decidí devolverlo.
La ventaja de comprar reneweds en Amazon es que tienes 1 mes para probarlos y si no estás agusto devolverlos, pero ojo, las políticas dicen que en equipos Apple la devolución puede tardar hasta 1 mes, más lo que tarde el banco en poner el dinero en tu cuenta ya que tienen que revisarlos muy bien. Toma esto en cuenta si estas indeciso entre un reacondicionado o uno nuevo.
Es la primera vez que compro un reacondicionado y mi experiencia no fue del todo buena y finalmente es cuestión de suerte con estos equipos, recuerda que no todo es la estética y me queda claro que si puedes comprar un equipo nuevo no lo pienses y lo hagas pero si tú presupuesto es limitado pues es un volado.
Espero te sirva mi reseña. 😊"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo llegó en buenas condiciones con un par de golpes en las esquinas y rayones en los bordes de las cámaras (las cámaras están en buenas condiciones y sin rayones en los cristales).
La batería con un 87% de calidad, la pantalla sin rayones y todas las funciones operan de forma normal:
Bocinas, micrófono, WiFi, Bluetooth, Face Id, etc."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El celular viene bien, con un cargador genérico y funcionando sin problemas.
Solo tenia dos rayones en el marco de la esquina y bateria al 88%, pero la verdad por precio no me puedo quejar."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me sorprendió mucho que la batería llegará en un 99%, el teléfono no presenta muchos detalles físicos prácticamente un 9 de 10, en cuánto a su funcionamiento es muy bueno llevo una semana con el y no he tenido problema alguno, actualizaré después para más detalles..."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No está al 100 detalles estéticos pero pro el precio pasa"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Todo correspondiente a la descripción
Batería (87%)
Estetica (9/10)
Cámaras, Bluetooth, Wifi, Red (10/10)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Condiciones físicas muy buenas, sin daños considerables, muy ligeros rayones propios del uso. Funcionamiento excelente y condición de batería al 90%."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es un buen equipo en mi experiencia es la primera vez que compro algo reacondicionado y hasta el momento no me ah dado fallas espero siga igual"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Lo único que no me gustó y eso es con amazon quendice garantía de 90 días de producto renovado y al mes ya no te da la opción de devolverlo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compré un iphone de estado “aceptable”, pero en muy buen estado físico (la compra fue con clevercel). Batería con el 87% de vida, ninguna pieza modificada, sólo unos raspones en las esquinas (se ocultan con una funda), y lo mejor 2k menos que los que dicen “estado excelente”. Yo sí recomiendo clevercel."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Llego en muy buen estado, tiene unos pequeños detalles casi invisibles. La batería con 94% de condición. Estoy contenta por ahora y me parece una muy buena opción para ayudar al planeta y no comprar productos completamente nuevos!!
Lo usare por unos días mas para ver su funcionamiento pero hasta ahora estoy encantada!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Sinceramente yo lo regrese, porque los detalles estéticos eran visibles, tenían golpes de uso fuertes eran dos, pero si eran demasiado preocupantes porque pensé que vida le habrán dado entonces ? Todo era original y lo demás estaba bien por el precio, sino te importan esas cosas te recomiendo el producto."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Lo conseguí con un costo promocional de $13,100 MXN. Por ese precio es un equipo muy bueno que no le pide nada al modelo 13 e incluso 14, ya que las únicas diferencias están en el chip, el video y un par de cosas más como los 6 meses de Apple Music. Ahorrarse entre $5,000 y $8,000 por tener casi lo mismo es una gran ventaja, con eso fácil te compras los Airpods Pro.

Fuera de eso, la calidad (en mi caso) fue muy alta, ya que el equipo llegó en excelente estado (como nuevo, sin rayones, solo con cargador y cable) y hasta el momento totalmente funcional.

Recomendaría comprar aparte un cable USB-C a Lightning para aprovechar la carga rápida y una buena funda para que luzca."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelentes condiciones, me llego con el 100% de la batería. Mi mejor compra"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Tengo un mes con el celular, hasta el momento me ha funcionado muy bien, me llego bien cuidado con algunos pequeños rayones que no se notan,la pila es de 89%, lo entregaron con cargador,cable,estoy muy satisfecha con la compra"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No se si fue suerte pero me salio bueno a pesar de ser reacondicionado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hice un estudio previo a la compra asi que el iPhone llego como se supone que llegan todos los Renewed, la caja en perfectas condiciones y con lo prometido. El telefono SI tiene signos asi que le dare en estetica un 9/10 tiene 3 ""picaduras"" en los marcos y un muy pequeño raspon en el borde de la camara. La pantalla tiene muy pocos arañazos, nada que impida el uso de la pantalla ademas que el protector hace que se vea impoluto. La bateria llego en 90% y el cargador incluido es funcional a mas no poder, inclusive quise hacer la primer carga con un cargador rapido de Samsung y no quizo, solucion: usar el incluido generico. El software esta bien, la compatibilidad con la telefonica (Telcel) a la primera, 4G y 5G funcional, y todas las conexiones funcionales. En pocas palabras hice una prueba general que me llevo un dia y medio y nada fallo. La bateria no tiene problemas, la pantalla no tiene problemas, las camaras funcionan perfectamente. Creo que abriendo la mente a pensar que es un celular seminuevo te das cuenta que es una excelente compra y que te ahorraste un muy buen dinero."
"Apple","iPhone 12","He comprado antes equipo electrónico ""refurbished"", ""open-box"", y un Iphone X ""re-acondicionado"" hace 3 años que finalmente ha fallado y quise reemplazar con el modelo 12, pues para mí representan un gran retorno de valor por mi dinero; sin embargo creo que están pervirtiendo malintencionadamente el uso de la palabra pues la unidad que recibí es simple y llanamente usada. En la imagen incluido se aprecia el daño que presenta la carcaza, que sería lo primero que espero sea re-acondicionada, pero pero aún, al encender el equipo el sistema indica que la vida de la batería está al 86%, misma que debió ser ""re-acondicionada""; entonces no entiendo qué es lo que dicen que garantizan en el re-acondicionamiento, simplemente deberían decir unidad con dos años de uso y listo, si alguien lo compra sabe qué esperar.
Las estrellas otorgadas son por la rápida atención al envío, aunque puedo suponer la urgencia por deshacerse de inventario muerto. En apple el totalmente nuevo está sólo cuatro mil pesos más, que es lo que haré ésta vez: ir a la segura con el nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No viene con cargador."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Aunque es verdad que cuenta con buena estética dentro de lo que cabe (porque tanto la bocina de arriba como el micrófono y altavoz están sucios), me llegó con 88% la vida de la batería 🥹, se comporta bien, pero con otros proveedores es raro que llegue por debajo de 90%, de ahí en fuera todo excelente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","TODO BIEN, VINO EN CAJA GENERICA.. EN ESTETICA LE PONDRIA UN 9"
"Apple","iPhone 12","La descripción del producto era de condición excelente, daños no visibles a más de 30 cm y aparte, un equipo supuestamente ""renewed"". Venía totalmente golpeado, la pantalla rayada e incluso levantada, como despegada y quisieron ""engañarme"" poniéndole una mica. Terrible experiencia, no vale para nada la pena, estás comprando un producto peor que usado, porque mi celular actual tiene 5 años conmigo y no tiene la cantidad de golpes que este supuestamente renovado. Ya había comprado por amazon renewed y fue impecable, pero esta vez súper mala experiencia"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","En general, el equipo está en muy buenas condiciones. La condición de la batería está al 100%, estéticamente no tiene ningún detalle ni en la parte trasera ni en los laterales y todo funciona perfectamente.Lo único que no está en tan buena condición es la pantalla, que cuenta con algunos rayones visibles y que son más profundos de lo que esperaba de acuerdo a la descripción del producto, pero debido a que lo demás está en perfecto estado no me molesta.En cuanto a los accesorios, no son originales; el cable me parece bueno pero el cargador si me parece de mala calidad por lo que no lo usé. Además, el equipo venía con un cristal templado instalado, lo cual se agradece.Definitivamente me parece una muy buena compra, con el único detalle de que la condición de la pantalla fue peor de la esperada."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Con el dispositivo todo bien hasta el momento, solo que el cable para cargar venia mal... tendria que haber sido usb a lightning y me venia con un usb a usb tipo ""c""."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Superó todas mis expectativas, quedé muy satisfecho con mi compra. Llegó al día siguiente. El iPhone venía bien empaquetado, con mica en la pantalla y cargador. Solo con unos pequeños detalles en la cámara que realmente no se notan nada. Capacidad de la batería del 93%"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es muy buena oferta y el teléfono está perfecto tiene unos muy pequeños detalles pero nada importante o que afecte, si lo recomiendo por el precio que es esta mucho mejor que uno nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Estaba un poco nerviosa de saber cómo iba a llegar pero para mi sorpresa todo llegó en orden, y con batería condición al 100%, no me ha fallado en nada el iPhone, lo recomiendo ampliamente"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me gustó mucho el iphone 12 que compré ya que tenía 92% de batería y una estética de 9.8, recomiendo al vendedor BuySPRY."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Llegó pronto, me llegó con la pila al 100 funciona bien, solo que llegó con unos rayones en la pantalla los cuales no afectan su funcionamiento y solo se notan con la pantalla apagada"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Equipo en muy buen estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy recomendado ,compre el renovado de Amazon Estados Unidos y fue una excelente compra , esta totalmente nuevo ."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El estado era casi perfecto, un pequeño golpe en una esquina y un rayón menor, marca condición de batería al 100%, el sistema no marca reemplazo de batería y marca justo 12 meses de uso, el problema es que la batería si bien dura, no llega al nivel de una batería al 98% de uno uso con el que pude comparar, por lo cual me hizo sospechar que fue alterado el software.Casi todo funciona bien pero algunas apps se traban o como en el caso de Tik Tok, se queda pegada una canción del video anterior.Lo devolví porque no me dio confianza esas fallas random de software.En mi caso era la versión premium ,Vendido y enviado por Amazon USA"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compré el articulo pero venía bloqueado de por operador :(. Regresé el telefono y volví a comprar pensando que solo fue mala suerte la primera vez, la segunda vez todo excelente, el iphone esta en muy buenas condiciones y ahora si esta desbloqueado."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Honestamente si he comprado bastantes productos refurbished y la gran mayoria me han salido muy buenos, pero este se llevo la corona. El iphone me llegó con 98% de batería, mica de cristal templado y Apple Care con vigencia de 7 meses el día de la compra. Desconozco si todos vengan en esas condiciones pero al menos el mío si lo traía. Lo mejor de todo es que por comprarlo en los días del prime day, me costó un 40% menos de su precio original!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente llego como nuevo y hasta con mica"
"Apple","iPhone 12","En el anuncio mencionaba que habían dos opciones: buena y excelente. Seleccione “excelente”, pero el equipo venía con rayones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Para ser un equipo remanufacturado, está en buenas condiciones. La pantalla, sin rayones y el funcionamiento de hardware y software está bien. sólo unos detalles mínimos de estética en la parte inferior. llegó bien empacado.El único problema es que necesito factura y a la fecha el vendedor no la ha enviado después de varias solicitudes."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Vida de batería al 99%, estética de 9.5/10, excelente relación calidad-precio. No viene con el cargador ni cubito originales, pero es genérico y funcional. Lo volvería a comprar totalmente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono lo mandan en perfectas condiciones, funcionando todo, sin embargo mi equipo llegó con un rayón profundo en la pantalla (se entiende debido a que el equipo no es nuevo)"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded.
 Llegó con 90 por ciento de batería, llegó sin ningún rasguño, en verdad que a vista parece un equipo totalmente salido de tienda, incluso vino con una Mica incluida y el cargador generico es carga rápida, lo recomiendo mucho, ya voy para un mes con el y todo está perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12"," Llegó con 90 por ciento de batería, llegó sin ningún rasguño, en verdad que a vista parece un equipo totalmente salido de tienda, incluso vino con una Mica incluida y el cargador generico es carga rápida, lo recomiendo mucho, ya voy para un mes con el y todo está perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El producto llegó a tiempo y gran estética , solo un pequeño detalle en la parte de aluminio del tamaño de la punta de una aguja. De ahí en fuera como nuevo la pila al 100% ningún rayón visible en la pantalla. Viene con protector de muy buena calidad cometí el error de ponerle uno y la calidad del touch bajo muchísimo por eso me di cuenta que tenia doble mica termine quitándole la otra. Trabaja de las cámaras excepcionales cabe resaltar que tenía el S20FE solo extraño poco el Zoom de 3x pero realmente se usa pocas veces. Estoy muy feliz con esta compra."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Muy buen celular, lo recomiendo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo me llegó con el 100% de condición de batería y pensé que la habían cambiado pero al revisar el serial es el mismo de fábrica, solamente unos rayones en la pantalla y la tapa trasera que a simple vista no se ven de tienes que verlo a contra luz, de ahí en fuera el equipo parece nuevo y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo llego con muy pocas imperfecciones, algún que otro tallón en las orillas y bordes de la cámara, lo que si no me gusto para nada fue que ni con la ""limpieza"" de expertos Amazon pudieron borrar las marcas de uso de la funda del antiguo dueño.
batería 87%
golpes y rayones, aceptables ya que hablamos de un equipo usado, eso si la pantalla impecable ningún desperfecto. solo que eso de que tenga marcas de uso de funda la limpieza algo flojita por partes de los trabajadores.. por un ahorro de 4500 pesos. pues esta bien, igual hay lugares como movilmx y smart depot que lo encuentras mas barato."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El telefóno me llego en 1 día, me llego con la cajita generica igual que el cargador, el dispositivo fisicamente tiene solo 2 golpecitos uno en la parte de abajo y uno cerca de la camara, pero no afecta nada a la camara solo es un pequeño rayoncito en el borde que cubre a la camara, fisicamente es un 9.5 funcionalmente jala bien la vida de la bateria es de 87% hay gente que les toca suerte y sale arriba de 90 pero bueno esperemos que no afecte en su funcionalidad"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El producto me indica que la pantalla no es original y que fue sustituida por una pantalla que no da garantía de que el celular funcione correctamente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El producto llego en excelentes condiciones, 0 rayones, 100% de vida util de bateria e inclusive tenia un protector de pantalla ya instalado, estuvo perfecto.

El unico detalle, viene con un cable muy corto y un adaptador de corriente de pocos watts, es necesario comprar los aditamentos si quieres conseguir una mejor experiencia pero comparado con uno nuevo y sellado que tampoco viene el cargador si es un buen ahorro, lo recomiendo si buscas no invertir tanto en un telefono de esta gama."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es el segundo iPhone 12 que compro y el primero me llego con 89% de batería y en estética un 9 y este último me llego con batería 100% y estética al 10 prácticamente podría decir que era nuevo."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Nicely packaged. Actually is in excellent condition (which is the condition I picked). No scratches on this one. Genuine product. Comes with a charger too."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me animé a comprarlo pues necesitaba cambiar mi anterior teléfono. Al leer los comentarios fue que me convencí, de ve casi como nuevo, leves detalles de en la parte de la cámara que se despintó pero es menor a 1mm, son solamente dos puntitos. Así en otras dos zonas que siendo honestos apenas y se notan, con funda ni siquiera sabrás que no es nuevo. Todo funciona perfecto, batería al 91%, muy satisfecho con la compra. Viene en una caja genetista con cable “hecho para iPhone” y un cubo genérico, además de cubierto en una película para evitar rasguños en el teléfono, no me arrepiento hasta ahora."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Tomando en cuenta que es un equipo USADO, esta muy bien batería al 90.
Hablando del iPhone 12 red tiene un lado sin metal pero es normal por la edición"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me costó muy barato para las condiciones en las que venía, prácticamente como nuevo y con el 100% de condición de batería. Todo funciona excelente, fue una gran compra"

Everything works like new."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Llego con 90% de vida de bateria, tiene algunos rayones y detalles estéticos pero no se perciben a simple vista y no afectan en el rendimiento. Viene perfectamente limpio y con una mica de cristal templado."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Se le acaba la pila súper rápido
Aveces se trababa la pantalla al comienzo
El audio se escucha horrible si quiero poner altavoz o música
Pero la estética física súper da el gatazo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Producto no es reconstruido como dise de echo es usado cargador no son originales caja no vino solo venía la caja de Amazon venía solo el teléfono , cheque la pila solo trai el 80% nada que ver con las foto que publico trai rayones en la parte de abajo y el display no es oled según yo lo compre por que era reconstruido No usado , un poco desecionado 😔"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Pues tuve mala suerte, estética de 8/10 viene con varios rayones y la batería es de 88, lo voy a devolver"
"Apple","iPhone 12","De la mejor compra, tuve la oportunidad para comprarlo cuando aún estaba más BARATO y no me arrepiento, el equipo llegó intacto, nuevo totalmente, sin ningún rayón, hasta la batería en 100% no lo podía creer, recomiendo el equipo y al vendedor. Mi primera compra renewed y de la mejor experiencia"

"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono estaba como nuevo, batería al 100%, solo un pequeño detalle en la pantalla pero es imperceptible.
Al activar el teléfono se apagó la pantalla y busqué información y es una cuestión de firmware que se soluciona al reiniciar el teléfono. Muy buena compra lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente compra, esperaba más de batería pero con un 86% es suficiente."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El producto llegó con 86 de batería , pantalla en estado implacable , ningún solo arañazo, sorprende"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Lo devolví, porque la batería estaba al 86%, la considero muy baja para ser un Iphone 12."
"Apple","iPhone 12","LO DEVOLVÍ PORQUE NO SE PUDO VOLVER A CARGAR, PENSÉ QUE ERA EL CARGADOR Y LO INTENTÉ CARGAR CON OTRO CARGADOR, PERO SOLO CARGÓ LO SUFICIENTE PARA PRENDER Y DE ALLÍ NO PASÓ, OJO YA HABÍA COMPRADO OTRO CELULAR RENEWED Y ME FUNCIONÓ MUY BIEN, NO SÉ POR QUÉ ESTE NO, A LO MEJOR PORQUE EL OTRO ERA SAMSUNG."

"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo llego el día que decia al momento de la compra. La vida de batería fue de 100%, lo cual me sorprendio mucho. Un par de detalles fisicos en el marco, pero para ser renewed esta muy bien.
La caja y cargador pudieron ser mejores, pero de lo demas no hay queja."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Comprado con el vendedor BuySPRY, el teléfono llegó en buenas condiciones, solo un rayo en la parte de arriba del teléfono, pero ya prendida la pantalla no se nota.

"Apple","iPhone 12","Me tocó un dispositivo con el 100% de salud de la batería, con unos rayones casi imperceptibles (no noté los rayones cuando le puse mica) y funciona demasiado bien, fui a Apple a que le corrieran un test y todo salió súper! Es seminuevo y desde mi experiencia muy recomendable!
PD También venía con garantía por 3 meses en Apple"

"Apple","iPhone 12","Me llego a tiempo, me llego unos rasguños pero muy superficiales, de batería me llego al 89% con mica, para el precio fue una excelente compra, el único pero que le pondría es que viene con cargador y cable genéricos, pero de ahí en más todo está Perfecto"

"Apple","iPhone 12","El producto está muy bien, me lo mandaron sin ningún golpe, solo un muy muy leve rasguñ, no visible a simple vista. Les recomiendo comprar el producto directamente con *Amazon internacional*, ya que te mandan una caja con los datos de que se reviso del equipo y la pila está casi nueva, y pues lo principal, es que 100% seguro que te envíen el teléfono que pediste"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Parecía nuevo, la batería en 87%, estéticamente le pondría 10"

Afortunadamente, este iPhone 12 de 64gb que compré es hermoso y funciona a la perfección. La estetica es de 10/10 y yo corrí con la suerte de que la condición de batería viniera al 100%.

Sin duda alguna una de las mejores compras que he hecho."

"Apple","iPhone 12","Llego muy bien , esta prácticamente nuevo , con cargador y cable genericos.
Trae una mica protectora para la pantalla , unos rayones muy leves en la parte de enfrente, nada significativo, muy contento con la compra.
Se le revisaron todos los aspectos y la bateria tambien esta excelente"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El iPhone es magnífico!
Tal vez algún ligero detalle en el marco de una cámara, pero nada que afecte el TOTAL funcionamiento.
Volveré a comprar!
Gracias Amazon!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Sinceramente el equipo me llego en excelentes condiciones, no tiene ninguna ralladura. viene como nuevo.
Volveré a comprar de esta manera."
"Apple","iPhone 12","La verdad el equipo si llega con detalles visibles, es calidad precio obvio pero que te llegue como nuevo es muy difícil, las funciones las cumple, pero la verdad si tu tienes la ilusión de que te llegue como si fuera uno nuevo, no es así, es mi segunda compra y la segunda vez que lo devuelvo, son detalles que no se pueden pasar por alto así sean equipos reacondicionados, lo sé, hay reseñas buenas pero son muy pocas, en mi experiencia si te vas a gastar si o si más de 10 mil pesos mejor ahorra un poco más y compra uno nuevo o te puedes desilusionar o sentir estafado."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El telefono tiene buena vida de bateria (98%) y detalles minimos en el marco pero la pantalla tiene muchos rayones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Excelente compra , me llegó como nuevo , sin detalles estéticos, condición de batería al 95%, mica protectora … de verdad una excelente compra , inicia cargador y Chablé nuevos ( genéricos )

"Apple","iPhone 12","EXCELENTE EQUIPO LLEGO COMO NUEVO"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El teléfono muy bonito por la parte de atrás pero el frente todo rayado como si un niño hubiese usado las llaves para dibujar en la pantalla del iPhone! Luego el vendedor le pone una mica de protección para simular que el teléfono está en buenas condiciones! Un verdadero engaño! No puedo creer que Amazon se preste a este tipo de estafa! Este teléfono no vale esos 500 dólares que me cobraron!!!!!
Ojalá y Amazon ponga en su lugar a estos vendedores fraudulentos! 😡"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo llegó bien, con caja y cable (genéricos pero funcionales). Tiene unos leves raspones que se ven al detalle, en funcionamiento, hasta el momento, perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Got my phone. Wasn't unlocked like they said. Completely unacceptable. Don't ever buy from them."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Al recibir el teléfono (iphone 12)hace 4 meses parecía una excelente compra. Soy muy cuidadosa, nunca se me ha caido ni mojado, esta como nuevo, sin embargo dejó de funcionar de la nada. Casualmente solo un mes después del periodo de garantía. 16,000 pesos a la basura, el vendedor simplemente dejó de responder y se lava las manos con su garantía de 90 días. Son teléfonos listos para durar solo 4-6 meses. Cuidado!"
"Apple","iPhone 12","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Sin lugar a dudas una compra satisfactoria"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me encanto que llegó Rapidísimo. Con un estado de la batería del 97%..| Técnicamente Nuevo y a un súper precio"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Llegó en excelentes condiciones, batería al %89 pantalla y parte trasera intactas."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El equipo en buen estado solamente que no es lo que dice la descripción puesto que decía que era equipo libre pero venía con una sim de T Mobile, y estaba bloqueado por el operador al momento de ingresar mi sim de Telcel me mencionaba ese bloqueo de SIM inválida, solicitaré mi reembolso."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Buen producto. Me llegó con 94% de pila y en buenas condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El día que lo use una aplicación trabo el iphone, y tuve que forzar apagado. No volvió a pasar hasta una semana después, se calentaba, se trababa y se apagaba solo, ademas llego con una cámara un poco golpeada. Me desilusiono que se dañara el equipo a la semana."
"Apple","iPhone 12","La batería es un chiste, tengo que cargarlo 3 veces en el día, la cámara, saca las peores fotos. todas las aplicaciones son de pago. Por suerte solo lo necesito para mi trabajo. mi Pixel 4XL es mil veces mejor."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Compre un IPhone 12 reacondicionado con la teoría que todo funciona a la perfección pero no me deja ni configurarlo, no me deja pasar de la sección (selecciona tu pais o region ), por lo tanto lo devolveré, les contare como me fue con la devolución, saludos"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Está nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","En excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Would not recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Hola buenas noches me gustaría hablar con alguien que se encargado sobre la calidad del iPhone es que está rallado y esperaba que estuviera en mejores condiciones espero tu respuesta gracias"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Pantalla rayada, lentes rayados y lo venden como ""renewed"" cuando claramente es un producto que ya ha sido usado y alterado. 30 minutos bastaron para darme cuenta de que no valía la pena, encima le ponen una mica de cristal para ""esconder"" los rayones y aparentar que están en la mica cuando no, están en el celular. Mala experiencia por completo"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El iPhone con una estética de 9.7, una batería del 98%, hasta el momento no ha fallado nada."
"Apple","iPhone 12","Subio 1000 pesos al cancelar la orden y a volverla a poner pero exelente calidad"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Es funcional pero la bateria ya venia al 80% de vida util. Se descarga muy rapido. La persona que lo usó nuevo si vivio la experiencia de una carga duradera.. ligeros raspones.La verdad quise cancelar la compra porque miré que nuevo salia al mismo precio pero ya no me permitio cancelar porque ya lo habían enviado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Me tocó a mi esta vez, mala recepción de wifi se desconecta estando a un metro de distancia, se baja la batería muy rápido 🪫 (no retiene la carga).....NO fue una buena compra 🚫.......Estoy esperando la devolución de dinero!!!$$$$$$$"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Teléfono en excelentes condiciones y muy buena batería"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El envío fue muy rápido, prácticamente al día siguiente de mi compra, pero no venía el iPhone, solo el cargador"
"Apple","iPhone 12","No fue compatible , y hasta el día de hoy no me hacen mi reembolso para poder adquirir un equipo que si pueda utilizar"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Would not recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Ya regresé tu producto me salió defectuoso por la cámara ya estafeta entrego el equipo quiero saber cuándo me podrás hacer el reintegro del dinero porfavor"
"Apple","iPhone 12","Ya no reclamé pues desde un principio supe que es reacondicionado"
"Apple","iPhone 12","El Iphone 12 64gb tiene muchos detalles estéticos, pantalla rayada, golpes en los marcos y la bateria en un 87%. Hice la devolución y estoy en espera de mi reembolso."
"Apple","iPhone 12","No sirvió. El iPhone 12 que pedí no funciono. Su estado era bueno, sin embargo nunca se pudo configurar, no se pudo actualizar y tampoco dejó transferir los datos, lo que me hizo pensar si era ROBADO. Ya había comprado anteriormente un iPhone 8 renovado y no tuve problema, pero este fue una total decepción.Regresé el teléfono y para evitar problemas mejor ya no lo volveré a comprar."
"Apple","iPhone 12","El celular llegó estéticamente bien, pero se reinicia sin ninguna razón a cada rato y parece tal cual lo regresan lo ponen a la venta sin rebizarlo realmente"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was brand new! Battery health of 100% perfect condition!
The only problem was that when I logged in my Apple ID, my data was stolen and purchases were made on my card within a few minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Item is exactly as stated in the seller description. Love the size! Didn't use facial recognition so can't rate it. Got all the features and no scratches on it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone came the morning after I ordered even though It was suppose to come a week later, everything came as described without a scratch,
the phone was at 100% max battery. Best purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon, definitely worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","So at first I was sketched out because it came in a box that was like for a phone I’ve never seen before but I opened it and was super excited. I mean it had a cube and charger and the phone was in perfect condition. It even had a screen protector on it which was cool. But I’m very excited and hope this helped!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s just like I got a brand new phone besides the battery capacity being at 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived actually unlocked and worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in, which after a long struggle with carriers and phones was a big relief. I can't speak on the facial recognition because I don't use it, but it seems like a like-new phone to me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone on sale on early access day and I chose to pay a little extra for the higher standard refurbished version. When I received it everything was good except there was an area on the screen that had several scratches. It is advertised as being scratch free with 90% battery but mine was scratched. My only recourse is to return it, not exchange it, meaning I lose the sale price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought for my daughter's 11th birthday and she loves it. Fast shipping great quality picture is beautiful and the mint color is gorgeous 🖤"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I order one from this shipper. It came with a malfunctioning screen and a notification on apple that the screen was not supported.
They don’t appear to do exchanges, so I had to return the first one and buy another.
Second try got one that works."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","ok so like most people buying a renewed from from amazon, I was a bit skeptical. However, when I got the phone in the mail I have to say I shocked. okay it wasn't packaged the best but it came with a SIM card remover, brand new charger, and a box which apple no longer provides. everything is working perfectly but when I unboxed the phone I noticed a pretty deep scratch on the bottom of the phone. I was a bit turned off but I had to remind myself that its a used phone that was half the price of a new one. overall im happy with my purchase and the scratch is no big deal just caught me off guard"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I like the fact that the battery health is 100%. It just have few hair line scratches and bumps on the corners. I am not very picky so for me it's ok. It is still very useful and usable. And it really came with the latest OS update when it came to me. For the price I pay for it, it is worth it. 😁"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","ty for this phone i love it. its a pretty blue i love and its a great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Like some of the other reviewers, I had concern about the condition of a 'renewed' phone. As it turned out, it arrived in perfect, like-new condition. No observable defects, no observable wear/scratches/scuffs even when looking closely, not at arms length as Amazon mentions.

Using the iOS battery health app, the battery health was at 100% when I received it. Amazon advertises that the phone will arrive with at least 80% battery health. To check, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health and then look at Maximum Capacity. If it shows up in problematic condition, Amazon covers it with a generous 90 day return policy. I suspect that the one I received was an 'instant regret' purchase by the original owner and returned immediately. It seems likely that most 'renewed' phones will have some battery degradation so expecting battery health to be at 100% is unrealistic.

The only issue I had was not related to this phone. Call sound quality wasn't good and drop outs. After doing a network reset, that was fixed. Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset Network Settings > enter your passcode and then Reset Network Settings (red letters). Your phone will reboot. You'll have to log on to your wifi network again and if you have a VPN, you may have to set that up again. After doing this, no drop outs and good sound quality. Note that the network reset process changed after the iOS 15 update. Going forward, the sequence above may change again.

Amazon's refurb department did a great job of cleaning, wiping the previous installation of iOS and repackaging it. Regardless, I did a complete reset before restoring from a backup. This probably isn't necessary but it brought some peace of mind knowing that It was a clean installation of iOS.

It arrived in a well designed aftermarket box designed for cell phones, an Apple charger, Apple cable and an aftermarket screen protector of the type used for shipping protection. They mention that it may come with an aftermarket charger and cable so don't expect Apple branded accessories.

Presumably most people purchasing the iPhone 12 Mini will have informed themselves of the pros and cons of this model (ahem..battery life). I'd guess that most will not find battery life to be an issue. For heavy users and for those that regularly use high drain features such as GPS navigation, it would be advisable to have charging capability in the car and at work.

The only thing I'd add is that if you want the leather MagSafe case from Apple, keep an eye on prices. It usually sells for 60 dollars but the black one was on sale in Amazon at the time of this writing for 23.99 + tax. Instant purchase and on the way.

I used an Apple leather case with an iPhone 8. I was satisfied with its basic protection, feel and handling. Its unlikely to provide as much drop protection as an Incipio Duo and other cases designed with drop protection in mind but 23.99 + tax was hard to pass up.

Happy customer, solid purchase for an unlocked iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone because my trusty iPhone8 was failing on me.
This is a good phone and there's no question about that. I use most of the features and like them.
Just one observation: while the mini form factor was great in its time, and I thought I would stay with it, I have the sense that app designers are making use of more screen real estate in their designs, and that the mini design is less than adequate today. Typefaces seem to be getting progressively smaller, and links are harder to hit.
My sense is that I should have gone with the now standard form factor rather than the mini, and I assuredly will for my next phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini looks and functions perfectly, battery maximum performance is 84% but that’s to be expected for a two year old iPhone. The battery still lasts for about a day on a charge. $340 for a unlocked phone in excellent condition is a great deal, I think."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No issues what so ever."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Wasn't disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It is so nice to have an option to have an iphone without the insane price tag! it came in perfect condition and you wouldve never guessed that it was used!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini for 400$ battery was at 100% life out of the box not a single scratch or dent this is my second time buying from Amazon renewed I would definitely recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I am not a fan of Apple products but needed this phone to work with other systems. The battery capacity was 88% out of the box (meaning 88% of the battery was functional and at full-charge (a reading of 100% after charging) meant it's full capacity of 88% was reached). I bought this refurbished so I was not expecting a full-capacity battery load. With that said:* I downloaded @ 8 of my favorite apps and removed/closed down a number that came with the phone that I would never use* Leaving the phone on without any frequent use, the battery charge lasted 3-4 days (@ 72-96 hours). I have not put it to the test of typical use phone/web/streaming use yet* The set-up was uncharacteristically simple and without a glitch - very surprising and greatly appreciated* Facial recognition has been perfect so far* My other phones have been large in size - but I thought I would try this ""mini."" Again, to my surprise - I really like it. I can hold and operate the keyboard with one hand - and small hand at that. It is very lightweight and easily fits into a pants pocket.So far, so good - very pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno. Tiene una pequeña marca en una esquina. La batería está al 88%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love the small size and the color because I can see it wherever I lay it down."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in excellent condition!! Looks brand new. Very happy I ordered."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was very skeptical about buying a phone online that was cheap like this for the phone I was getting. I read the reviews and my mind was a little more at ease. I got the phone earlier than it said which I was happy about. And the phone is in perfect condition it’s got good battery life. It’s like I bought it new from the store. I definitely recommend this product."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for 8 months then the earpiece speaker stopped working. No help from the seller at all"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I have been using this phone for just over a week now and it is just like new. Performs great, excellent battery life (may I also add 100% battery health out of the box!), responsive touch screen, great camera, fast Face ID, the list goes on. Only minor imperfection I notice is a very small scratch to the right of the screen glass (not on the screen glass) in the bottom-right corner. Otherwise, the device looks and works like it was just bought directly from Apple. If you are looking for a like-new modern iPhone on the cheap, this is one of the best money can buy.TL;DR: exactly like new with the exception of a minor scratch, would highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s perfect. I got it mainly got the size. But runs great. No issues. No scratches 100% battery.❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone is in pretty good shape for being refurbished. There’s some cosmetic damage do the exterior of the case, but I use a protective case anyway, so that’s not visible.I’m disappointed that they didn’t put a new battery in it. The battery health is only at 85%, which means I’ll have to have it changed soon. I feel like a refurbished phone should come with a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good value, too bad my wife dropped the phone in the toilet"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. It was in perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","AMAZING GET IT!!!!!! The battery capacity is 100 and works so nice"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great. Just what I was looking for. Good price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks brand new, not a single scratch, and 100% battery health. But weird things have been happening.First, I couldn’t activate this phone with my career’s online tool— one where you log into your account and enter the phone’s IMEI. This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process.Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren’t on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version.The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978. See screenshot.I’ve read that this is done by Apple to identify “gray market” devices, devices refurbished by unauthorized resellers, and iPhones that were demo units.This makes me wary that this phone may have been tampered with, compromised, or hacked.Like I said it is cosmetically in perfect condition, I was even impressed! But I have to return this phone and buy brand new for my peace of mind.Since it might just be my paranoia, I’m only knocking off one star. This renewed phone is for someone, just not me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto me agradó que llegó como nuevo y con cargador de carga rápida"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","iphone viene nuevo hasta con garantía de apple"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Ignore the smudges on the second photo, those are not scratches.My boyfriend wanted a newer phone, we were nervous, we bought it anyway. The condition of this phone is AMAZING. He ordered the 64GB, blue. There are roughly 6 cosmetic issues and I don’t even want to call them cosmetic issues. They’re so tiny on the back of the phone, it looks like someone took a sewing needle and simply POKED the phone. They aren’t even noticeable unless you’re deliberately checking for imperfections and the phone is practically on your nose. I’ve seen worse done with brand new phones from shipping.Now, the new iOS updates allows you to go into settings to find non genuine parts like displays, batteries, cameras, etc. This phone doesn’t pop for a SINGLE off brand part. Every single part in this phone seems to fully check out to apple or simply have not even been replaced.I even went farther and logged into my apple support. The phone was first purchased in 2020, and hasn’t had a single pop up there for unauthenticated parts either. Further boosting us into loving the idea that this phone is all Apple.The camera works perfectly and the battery health is at 84% which is a great health rate for him, and a used phone in general.The phone was also entirely unlocked. I didn’t have to pay anything to turn it on, I was able to use my old SIM card, and it was fully set up to my carrier MOMENTS after restarting the phone.The only thing I didn’t check was the light in the sim port for water damage. But with how wonderful this phone is, I’m not even bothering taking the sim back out to check.Extremely lucky buy, or extremely great sellers. Who knows, but we’re thankful.Whoever this phone was bought from, amazing person. Whoever “fixed” this phone, amazing person. We couldn’t be happier purchasing this. Especially it being the first time we bought refurbished, ever."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","One afternoon I picked up my good old 6s and discovered...a brick. I needed a new (to me) phone quickly, so I ordered a renewed/refurbished 12 Mini. I live in the sticks, so overnight delivery just doesn't happen, but I was happy with 2nd day delivery. I find the 12 Mini is a good size for my hand."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Over all it's like new. The only one issue, is that there is a small scratch on the glass. If it didn't have that scratch, I would have given it 5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine in every detail, except battery life is not quite as long as desired."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was in desperate need of a new phone for a few months as my iPhone 8 was suffering from a broken charging port (wireless was the only way I could charge) and excessive battery drainage. Instead of dealing with my phone retailer and getting a new payment plan I decided to just buy this and put my current SIM card in.The phone came in generic packaging with generic charging accessories. But I was able to transfer my data from my old phone to this one within an hour of receiving it.The phone came with very very minor scratches on the back glass which isn’t an issue at all. Functionality was perfect, it felt like having a brand new phone. Only thing I didn’t like was the battery’s life was not at 100% so it does drain about halfway to 50% when I don’t charge it for about 10~ hours. Overall a great quick option if you need a new phone fast with no hassle."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","So it’s a refurbished phone alright.My complaints are…. Lines in the screen on a white background, phone over heats easily, and some people say they can’t hear me clearly on calls.I like…. It’s battery is solid.(I went from an iPhone 6, to a iPhone 12)I think you can find a better phone for cheaper on other sights. I probably wouldn’t go this route again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I read some of the reviews about some of their other products and was skeptical but when I got the phone it was basically like new. No scratches, the battery life was 100%, no dents or anything. Thank you, I needed the phone really bad."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I liked that the phone looks really good and looks brand new. What I did not like is that the battery is at 89% but it doesn’t matter to me"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 I tried something and I would have to admit that so far. I am truly impressed, The package reached my sky box before the scheduled time. Only received it today, it was properly packaged, and I just finished transferring from my previous iPhone, upgrading from the 6 S.
I choose good and the video is what I received. There are some lines around it, not sure what is that. ( ignore the dust by the volume button that is crumbs from my crackers)
Battery health is 100, Face ID is working properly and touch screen, will love to know what the lines is about doh"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in excellent like new condition, battery is decent, 87% maximum capacity. Everything works as it should."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","my phone came in almost pristine condition. so far, i have seen no problems that are super obvious. there are some scratches on the screen but not noticeable unless you specifically look for it under light. the battery condition came at 89% so it was pretty decent. i’m really happy with what i got! it looks pretty much like new and everything works perfect too!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love my little phone. It’s paid for and mine idc who had it before me lol."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very good. Only I don’t receive any key for Sim card removal"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got this phone as a gift for someone. The person was super happy. Very good condition. Delivery was great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I picked 64gb cause I used to have 32 and oh my gosh it’s a life changer!! Any way the touch screen is really good the face recognition is spot on!!! And the battery life I just can’t start or this would be a 500 paged SA lol but overall it’s the best I really recommend and there wasn’t even a scratch on it 😄"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Definitely worth the buy bought it for my lil bro he now uses it and there hasnt been any issues it is unlocked because now he’s not in the US and it works just fine with other Carriers"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Ok!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The response time of the screen is a bit slow. I do not know why. Also, the processor is slow too. I have had Iphone SE 2 until september, which was way faster than this, and had a much better screen response time."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","La batería no está al 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with only 83 percent battery life how is this renewed. Scratched and dings and the screen is not OEM!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Item was shipped quickly. It was as described no scratches or cosmetic damage at all. Only negative if I had to put one down is when I checked battery condition it checked out at 94%. Still good but that’s the only reason I did not give a 5 star for the whole review. If I had the option I probably would put a 4.5 stars."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s a real apple iPhone so that’s a start. However, the battery life is meh and it overheats quite fast when in the car as I’m driving so I keep it in my lap that seems to help. Nevertheless, it works and that’s what I was hoping for when I bought it. Better than my SE maybe"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","actually unlocked, thankfully. good quality. will update if i find anything wrong with it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was debating weather or not I wanted to write this. However I know how important it was for me to see real reliable reviews so here it is…

This review is going to be about the quality of product they sent me. Not the phone itself but I will cover that too.

First impressions,
Came very poorly packaged. I was really worried the phone was going to be broken or just horrible. The phone was only protected by a small box. The phone was loose in the box and it was only protected by a bit of bubble wrap. I took the phone out and immediately I wasn’t impressed. The phone was dirty like really dirty. I took about 5 minutes of wiping it down until I was satisfied. Then I noticed the scratches… there’s a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me.

Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I’d highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It’s worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable.

Battery life is amazing. I’m a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false. I use Max brightness for about 7 hours on screen time and I still go to bed with around 20% battery."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","At first I couldn’t find my package, but the phone is amazing, works 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting delivery of my iPhone 12 mini until Friday; it came in the mail Wednesday, to my delight! With the exception of a little bit of dust lodged in the phone’s Silent Mode switch and in the earpiece grille, the phone looked like new, came wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap, and also came with a Lighting cord and a neat little charging brick, similar to the ones Apple makes. Battery capacity was at 87% which is not too far off from mint condition. I set up my phone, synced my iCloud information, inserted my SIM card, and I was good to go!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I recommend the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Got the phone, it works great, other than some IOS related software bugs and issues (when setting the phone up) it's great! I selected the ""good"" quality option when I purchased. There ARE some scratches and dents in the frame, none in the screen, to show you how big they are a photo is attached (the one in the picture by the charging port is one of the biggest ones I've found) battery came 87% original capacity and unlocked with all carriers, face ID works wonderfully"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","At 75 years old changing from an iPhone 6 to a 12 Has had its challenges but overall I found it pretty simple to set up. I have not carried a purse and years so I did not want to go to a bigger screen than I had to. The 12 mini still fits very well in my pocket and I like it very much. I’m still learning to navigate around, not having a home button is a bit different but I think I’m doing pretty good overall"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good phone, only issue is a heavy dent on a corner. It gets cover with the case. Still worth the value."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Blue tooth doesn’t work"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone, thinking it was a big risk with it being renewed. The day I got the phone, it came with the original screen protector and a charging cable. I loaded it up and it had 100% battery life and was very snappy. I will be doing this again when I need another phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well overall but the phone was pretty dinged up around the edges"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It will be 60 degrees out and HOT when plugged in and gives error message. I have done all recommendations of closing all programs, restarting etc. Nothing helps."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No scratches at all, the camera and sound if perfect. Battery is 85%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very good condition. So far everything works good."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The main reason I purchased used was because my last phone was a broken iPhone 6s Plus I received as a gift to repair. I repaired the screen, speaker, front and rear cameras, and battery and the phone became like new.
Fast forward a few years and now that iPhone 6s Plus has become very dated. I took the risk of buying a renewed iPhone 12 mini because of 3 reasons: about the same usable screen size as iPhone 6s Plus; the much lower cost (~$200 cheaper than new); and I was confident that I could do some repairs on it if it were to fail. Received the phone ahead of the delivery date and it came with a USB-A Lightning cable (and I think a power brick, but I don't remember). There was just one very minor scratch on the front glass that is only noticeable with the screen off and if you really paid attention. Battery was over 90% max capacity and still lasts me the whole day.
Very satisfied with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything seems to work fine so for my only issue is that it did not come with a SIM card tryna and without that I can’t activate the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The back camera glitches when I go to take a photo. It never focuses on what I click on or if I simply put the camera on a object it makes a weird noise and loses focus. This is very annoying and stops me from taking and videos or pictures."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone is an upgrade for me from XR. So worth it! No scratches or dents. The battery life lasts 2 with lighter use. can't find one thing wrong with it. Very pleasantly surprised. It even arrived 2 days earlier than estimated. The camera in this little phone is amazing as well. I am very happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I would like the battery to have a higher percentage of charge, I received it with 87%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone came in absolute perfect condition! The only problem was when I went to activate it with AT&T, they said it was blocklisted and suspended because the phone was reported as stolen 7 months ago. I had to return and buy a new phone. The new phone wasn’t stolen!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Product well packaged, quickly delivered. Accurately described and “works like new”. Would definitely buy refurbished from this seller again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone as described excellent seller would definitely do business with AGAIN!!!! I personally like the smaller screens.most phones look like your carrying your T.v. set with you. I don’t need a 72 inch screen for a phone. I’m patiently waiting for Apple to get a phone that’s in my wrist or something a little more futuristic anyway. Until then this will do! Maybe look through Steve Jobbs old notes and come up with something different Apple your look/style is about 5 years past due. This is a 5 star seller thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Esperaba mas vida util de la bateria, por el precio que pague, y la condicion seleccionada al comprar. Esteticamene OK, funcional OK , y Face ID OK."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I'm always a little nervous about buying refurbished electronics after getting burned once. But this phone has exceeded my expectations. Other than a small scratch on the screen that isn't even noticeable unless at just the right angle in the light, this phone is pristine. The blue color is beautiful, and the mini is just the right size for me, as I was upgrading from a iPhone 7.

PROS:
Transferring my info from the previous phone was quick and easy. I just sat them next to each other, and the phone did all the heavy lifting. Sound quality is good, and apps open quickly and run efficiently. It took a little getting used to not having the fingerprint ID and home button, but the face ID is almost instantaneous. Photos are fantastic, and the detail is amazing. I have yet to learn all the new features, but the low light pictures are much improved, especially of storms. Voice recognition and autocorrect in text messages seem to be more accurate than my 7 as well.

CONS:
At times it is a little sluggish to wake up. It takes a couple tries before it swipes open. And Siri seems to have more difficulty understanding me or giving me accurate answers, but maybe it takes some time for it to get used to my voice.

Overall, I am very pleased with this phone for the price. It's still higher than I like to pay, but refurbished was much cheaper, and it was a long past-due upgrade."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","What a great way to save money and update my phone! I have had my Amazon Renew iPhone for about a month and have had no issues, works great and arrived just as described. Very pleased with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Me agrado todo menos el precio y la novedad de que se oscurece la pantalla"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El teléfono me llegó impecable pero era más pequeño de lo que creía, así que lo devolví."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love love love my new phone. I always got really cheap phones because they’d break but now that I’m in a better place in my life this was a great deal for me to get the AT&T option which took my nano sim from my Alcatel. It was only $433 for the red att. No blemishes even except where the last person must’ve dropped it maybe tiniest chip of the red there. The battery capacity lasts me all day long that’s what was wrong with my Alcatel it would charge and I would be worried in cities because it would die even charging. The iOS 15 added amazing updates. I got the zagg elite screen protector and can’t tell any difference in my visuality it’s easy to peel off the first couple tries and get rid of any air bubbles. The spigen case is amazing too beat priced case and doesn’t overlap the screen. Renewed is the way to go this tax season y’all"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","We tried Backmarket twice for a refurbished phone and did not have much luck and had to return both. Tried Amazon and it was perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","it came in amazing condition and it looks brand new the battery came in 100% battery health!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s a good phone but it came with a 86% battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It took me 3weeks for it to be activated with my carrier. Even though the phone was through them."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought 2 phones, one white and one blue, and both were in perfect condition. They look like brand new phones just pulled out of the Apple box. They both work like new. Set up was soooo easy. I understand not all purchases will be perfect through the “renewed” process however, Amazon promises a 90 day return for all purchases if they don’t meet your standards. We are both very happy with our “new” phones!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I am surprised at how quick it arrived. The battery was at 94%. It was exactly as described. Thank you for a perfect transaction."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The product arrived in good condition and had no visible defects, although the display was slightly dirty. The phone works perfectly and setup was simple. However, after only a couple hours of use it was clear that the phone was nearly unusable due to the battery life. Although the stated battery capacity in the settings was above the specification in the product description (87%), actual usage showed far worse battery life. After only 2.5 hours of screen time of non-intensive activities, such as messaging and playing music, the battery had dropped from 67% to 4%. Additionally, sometimes when I checked the battery the percentage would have dropped 3-5% after only a couple of minutes. I also tried suggested ways to improve battery use, such as turning off 5G and background refresh, but none of these worked. I'm very disappointed as I was excited to get this phone at a reasonable price, but this was not up to the standards promised by the seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It was pretty good quality for a great price they even answer back pretty fast. shipping was great 2 day earlier!! they get 4 stars for that !! Now my only issue was when I got it it was locked now that was anyoing but it happens so I understand I figure out how to unlock it myself and they texted they would help me to unlock so if that case ever arrives you should be fine other than that it was a fantastic buy Amazon thx 👍👍👍👍👍"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought iPhone 12 mini (excellent condition). However, it has some scratches on it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone looks almost new without any visible scratches or dents. The battery capacity is at 87% well within the product descriptions. This iPhone costs close to $200 less than a new phone. Amazon will finance the phone with no interests via there VISA."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Even refurbished phones can look and run like brand-new I was kinda nervous because I’ve always had issues with refurbished new homes…but mine and my son‘s both were refurbished and you can’t even tell they are refurbished I just absolutely love them. amazing and have not given us any issues one bit so to sometimes put a little money back in your pocket go refurbished just look at all the details and everything and just go for the refurbished one because it will save not only money but you are still getting what you want and sometimes yes it doesn’t come in the original box but you are still getting what you want…for a lot cheaper tho so I will always shop on Amazon for everything including phones and will continue to give five stars everything I buy.!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works perfect as advertised very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I like the camera quality"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 Mini arrived with a small chip on the corner which is obscured by any normal phone case. Other than that perfect physical condition. Maximum battery life was at 80%. Other than that just like a new phone! Very happy with my purchase and glad to buy renewed. Would recommend to anyone looking to save $200-$300 on a phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone isn’t good condition face recognition works battery life is pretty good and the touchscreen as well everything works excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s almost like new, but so much easier to hold and carry than my older iPhone XR. I’m very happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m happy with my new iPhone 12 mini but I’m extremely disappointed in UPS. The family was out for the day so naturally UPS left the package in my garage but they didn’t set it up high enough and a dog got ahold of the package. My brand new renewed phone now has a crack in the screen from the dog biting it. Luckily the phone is okay and the crack isn’t too bad."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excellent cosmetic appearance, battery life is at 80% which is in their stated range. Looks good to me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Brand new, refurbished where?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone to buy outright. Don’t have monthly payments to worry about and I can choose what service I want. The touchscreen was a little sensitive at first. The face recognition is useful for not having to remember passwords. The battery doesn’t last long if you’re a power user so I would opt for the bigger ones next time. But great phone overall."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llego como indican en la descripción, algunas personas tuvieron suerte y les llego a un 100% condición de batería, en mi caso fue 89% y bueno creo que puedo vivir con eso, siendo un equipo renovado, con lo demás todo estuvo perfecto."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good phone for the money, I had almost no scratches on the phone, at least that I could find, so for the look of the phone I would give it a 9/10, also with face recognition there are no problems, it works well and quickly, but it has a very bad battery, every week the battery deteriorates by 1%, so I don't know how it will perform in a few months, but so far I have no problems, so decide for yourself whether to buy it or no."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Both phones I bought I purposely purchased from Decluttr Store after reading their reviews. They both were shipped and arrived quickly, both unlocked, 256 GB, and had no issues at all. One of the phones I got even still has a warranty on it. I also checked to make sure they were not stolen, and they were not. The phones themselves are great. I watched a guy online drop one like 10x from 9FT without a case on it and it survived fine. Sure I purchased a case and glass protector but I probably don't need either. I went from a 7 plus to this phone and really like how small it is. It reminds my of my old SE (the first edition). I would buy through Amazon again granted it's from a legit seller. Thanks again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","don't like that you can't be on YouTube the same time while you're browsing the Internet."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone is in perfect conditions with 88% of health battery that it’s ok!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was not expecting a like new product this phone, but based on Amazon’s description of their Renewed program (“professionally inspected” and “expertly refurbished” are two of the claims you see immediately when you browse their Renewed inventory) I expected the phone to be in better shape than it is. The screen is broken in a couple places and will need a replacement right away. I gave two stars because the phone is functional but I am disappointed that it didn’t have at least an intact screen. I did expect some physical imperfections on a refurbished product, but I feel like the screen is one of those things that really should be in good order, even when purchasing a refurbished product because of all the damage that can happen to a phone when the screen is not intact."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Although this I-phone doesn't use the fingerprint to lock and unlock, the facial recognition is nice but it sometimes unlocks when I prefer it doesn't unlock, nor does it have the center button. There is a bar that appears at the bottom of the screen that does what the button used to do. To view which windows are open, just hold the bar and drag the window to the center of the screen and all open windows are visible. To close unwanted windows (which will also log you off an open account like a bank account), slide the screen up until it disappears. Lots of nice features that come with the phone and the camera takes much better pictures than my much older I-phone 5. Battery life lasts SOO much longer, too. I also appreciate the slightly larger screen, and the phone isn't much bigger than the i-phone 5. I love my new (refurbished) phone! It works great!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Solid phone, very good, no noticeable scratches or scuffs, although a bit loose in the box it was perfectly fine once I opened it. It was provided with a cord and box and the only nit pick is that the battery life was at 95%

Other than that it was definitely worth buying here and saving $200 rather than paying an extra 200 for the same phone, a box and 5% more battery life from apple"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","no cracks or chips or scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This is my favorite model iPhone and fits in pocket. Battery easily lasts through the day. Face recognition is not great if you’re lying on your back."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Had some problems on the post office side where the phone got sent back. They were super quick when I notified them of the problem and they resent the phone. Thank you for the great customer service!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’ve never owned a brand new car. Nearly new, under 50K miles…that’s the way to go. I am now of the same mindset with iPhones. For $500 less than list price, I bought an iPhone 12-mini with 128 gb and it’s a great phone. I’m really happy with it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","People might say this is broken or useless I bought this for my son for his birthday and the phone was in perfect condition it had some fingerprints but it was alr and it still was 100% battery and no dents or no bad condition it's in perfect condition person who delivered it hand it to me so it was safe"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works well"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","In the reviews they are saying that battery is going the whole day, it’s not. Middle of the day it will be %30 percent, it is almost impossible to use it for whole day.

*i don’t play games"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","didn’t like it, I expected at least the battery life with 95%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is fully unlocked, it worked perfectly in Ecuador and everything was perfect, as a new one."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got this iPhone 12 mini off Amazon and I was really worried about buying phones online but I would have to say it was works like brand new. It came in a regular shipping box with a cheap charger. I only wished I had got an original iPhone charger but it still works just as any would. The battery life is good. I was worried with it being a renewed phone that the battery life would suck but it’s actually pretty decent for now. Will update if I have any future problems. But I would suggest this sale to anyone. It’s so worth it. It’s slick. Small and easy to handle"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Quede muy incomforme, muy pequeño y además me envían un cargador disfuncional y un clip de papelería (ni siquiera un original)"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone was almost like new.i am very happy with the phone.i feel it was a good feal."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived within the provided timeframe. It was in great condition and fully functional as advertised. It had great battery life remaining and it was reasonably priced compared to the same type of phone being sold on Amazon by other sellers. The seller responded quickly to our questions."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","the battery capacity of the phone is at 83%. basically needs to be replaced which is what im dealing with now... wish i would have known this was the case to begin with - i dont think i would've bought it. Otherwise the phone is in decent condition - everything seems to work."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Espero dure es mi primera vez comprando celular en Amazon se ve de buena calidad en perfectas condiciones me vino esta precioso"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is great just like buying from the apple store"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno practico"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Up until this purchase I was using an Iphone 7 with a screen cracked in every direction. It was a great phone but alas my ears getting cut when on the phone grew old. I'm on a sustainability journey, trying to reduce my e-waste and offset what others are doing, so I opted for a renewed Iphone, and I'm glad I did!

This phone came in great condition, all aside from a scratch on the screen. Since I was in it for the better camera, I didn't care about blemish like this. The battery life is amazing, there have been no technical glitches or issues, and I didn't bring a new piece of landfill technology into the world. Highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a cheaper, more sustainable, alternative to brand new $1,000+ iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty hesitant to buy this phone especially since it was my first ever time buying a renewed/refurbished item. I got mine from the seller O'Crack and all I can say is WOW.

The phone arrived at the earliest date which was really nice.
The phone has not a single scratch anywhere and I looked thoroughly. Everything works perfectly and even the box that it came in was a nice box. The accessories it came with were also very nice and not too cheap feeling.

In conclusion the phone could easily pass as brand new and I'm definitely buying from this seller in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I wanted a small smartphone so I decided on this one and I am happy that I bought. It has all the features as the larger one but at a smaller size. The color is nice and what can I say , its a iPhone and is a great phone with a operating system that I like. All in all I am happy that I purchased the iPhone 12 Mini."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The renewed product was in a nice package when it arrived. The phone itself has one or more dots on the edges of the phone that indicates the iPhone is used. Having used the phone for a week, it has been running good."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition; would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It was perfect. We all feel a little worry when we buy this type of products not in the official store, but It was all good. Obviously, is not a new phone. In this case it have a little, almost non perceptible, scratch at the back and battery was 91% but it is normal for what i was expecting. The price is so good comparing other sites that sells the same product for much higher prices"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Pequeños arañazos alrededor pero es normal por ser refurbished. La pantalla 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone came to me in very good condition. It looks and works as brand new. At first the screen was dim and it didn’t let me adjust it until I cut the phone off and back on. No issues."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Looks unused. Not one scratch on it which surprised me because it came in a USPS box wrapped in minimal bubble wrapped and the box was damaged. Had a charging cube and a cable. Battery life was 100%. I’m loving the smaller side phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","As for the phone itself, I love the 12 mini's size, the screen looks great, it's just so much more pleasant to handle than the other, much taller flagships.

But as to the condition... the listing is technically correct. Mine came with a hairline crack on the back glass' bottom right corner, and some scratches on the top right frame, but ""when held at arm's length,"" you can't see those things. Even though it'll always live in a case and I'll never see those flaws, it still might be a deal-breaker.
The screen and camera lenses are perfect, not even a scratch on them, so that's a plus.
The phone also works flawlessly, all buttons and functions work with no issues.

Just be aware that when you buy ""renewed,"" there will most definitely be varying degrees of condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, however much too small - I'm always looking for it so I replaced it with iPhone 13."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Looks as described. Perfect condition and working order. No problem at all."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I'm always someone looking for a deal, and this seemed like a great one. Ordering refurbished phones from Amazon has never been an issue, and I desperately needed a new one. When I got the iPhone, it wasn't even that secure in its box. I could hear and feel it move around, which didn't make me feel good knowing what I had spent. The phone is currently in the mail being returned because the battery was either no good or not an Apple battery.

I had a flurry of alerts pop up when I turned it on, saying there was a ""foreign part identified"" as the battery part. Within the first day, I was already having issues. The battery wouldn't hold a charge and would restart every few minutes. Even a 2-minute phone call was difficult because the phone kept restarting. I suppose there is an essential lesson in this: it pays to get New sometimes because it will last you in the long run. Now using a new iPhone 13 mini and couldn't be happier!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is ok but not great. It was sent without the latest software update and the charge doesn't work. The battery is only charging to 75%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Amazon said it was lost in the mail, and then it just showed up at my door 20 days later after I had already bought a different one. It was cheaper than the one I had bought, so I tested it to see if it worked with my Verizon prepaid network, and it did not. I was excited for this phone, but disappointed in wait time, lack of response from seller, and that it wasn’t compatible. On the bright side, it only had one small dent in left corner of phone, cosmetic issue. I looked at the battery life and it was at 80% of the original battery capacity. It turned on and worked fine. If it had worked on my network, I might have kept it maybe. It’s only 100ish dollars to get one that has full battery capacity and no cosmetic issues, so I went with my new unlocked iPhone from Apple. Do yourself a favor and just do that."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","came without scratches, literally a brand new iphone 12 mini.
my friends laugh that it's small but i love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone arrived with the original screen protector still in place, zero scratches, and 100% battery capacity. It looks brand new to me. The phone was unlocked as described. Buy with confidence from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great product, great service!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Arrived fast, with 99% battery health, not a noticeable scratch anywhere, unless something microscopic that I didn't care to look for. Looks and feels amazing. Got the 128gb for 500 doing18months payment, has 90 day warranty and is new or like new and it actually came with a charger head, what a deal! Just the packaging was wack, sending my secsi phone inside a little ziploc bag with no padding inside a mediocre box. Do not disrespect my iphone like that 😬 Get you one!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone on my trip to the US, I bought it unlocked to use in Colombia where I live, it came early and in perfect condition, no scratches, the screen works perfectly, it was promised to came with more than 80% of battery health it came with 89%. It looks like new, and for sure I am recommending this option to my friends."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived on time. It did not come in the original box but that didn’t matter to me. The phone looks brand new. The front screen and back of the phone had zero scratches or marks. Both cameras work great with no issues. Battery life is at 100%. Really happy I took the chance on this product!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone works well but it is very small"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received was immaculate. Slipped my new SIM card in, seamless transfer of apps etc. phone even came with a glass screen protector already installed, and we ALL know installing that screen protector is the worst part of setting up a phone. Very happy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The packaging was ok and it felt like refreshed, like new. The charger is generic and cheap quality. The phone does get hot after charging which may indicate some issues with battery or charging cable itself. Otherwise the setup was straight forward, credit goes to Apple for having the feature to upgrade by NFC/Airplay and synching up all of storage from old phone to new device?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","the device showed no signs of wear and the battery health is at 100%. Very pleased with the purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m writting the review on this phone btw, I love it! Had for about 4 months now and I have no problem at all!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excellent"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Small footprint"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately the size of this phone is smaller than I would have liked. My fault, so I'll have to make do with it until my wife decides to upgrade."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","everything worked good excetp the power button was a little hard to press down at first it was like somebody spiled something on the power button but other than that everything was fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was sceptical about a refurbished phone, but this one is still holding up and my mom is not a heavy apps user. So far so good, and it's looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I had a 6 and it was crashing so I purchased this mini 12. I figured it’ll be minor mishaps but it’s just like my 6 this mini 12 is crashing as well. I want a refund but don’t want to go without a phone so sucks for me. 1-5 I’ll rate “the look” a 4 there was a small crack on the phone that has spread. The phone itself glitches. It blacks out then I have to unlock it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Tenías mis dudas de si comprarlo pero con El Paso del tiempo me a funcionado de maravilla y no me a presentado ninguna falla recomendable no lo pensaré 2 veces antes de volver a comparar algo así"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","All is excellent with the phone and service from the seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","bought this phone back in february and has been perfect for me since then"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone came earlier than they said which was a plus. It came in good condition and even 100% battery life except that the mic would buzz every time I recorded. I tried resetting the phone and going through the settings but nothing worked. I contacted the seller to get it replace. They communicated really well and sent my a replacement and the problem was fixed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived faster than I expected and in perfect condition. I saw the reviews about the scratches and was a little nervous but the phone arrived fully unlocked, looking and working like brand new. This is only day 1, but I will update if anything changes"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone- no defects that I have found."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was a little hesitant when ordering an iPhone of all things from Amazon. However I was thoroughly impressed when it showed up! Shipping was extra fast and came quicker than expected (within 1-2 days)!

Came with everything pictured: Phone, wall plug, charging cable, and a SIM card remover tool. The phone was in excellent condition with no scuffs or scratches. Everything is working properly and the battery health is at 100%.

I love how small and compact the 12 mini is compared to the Pro. Fits into pockets perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El estado de la batería es una decepción para mí, con lo demás apariencia y funcionalidad cumple con lo descrito"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Nothing its amazing"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I understand this is a small phone and the battery is smaller hence the battery life is not the same as a big phone. Little disappointing, not the phones fault. The size of the phone is small but it will fit in the console of my car. The first thing I did when I got the phone was to increase the size of the text. The face recognition is great, no problems at all. The value for the money was great! Very easy to transfer all my data from my iPhone 6."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I received this phone recently and it was in amazing working order. Looked and felt brand new with 100% battery health! Shout out to eKings (Amazon Seller) for their prompt delivery, processing, and an extremely quality product. Would buy from them again!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","it’s pretty cool, looks like a new. good packing and battery life is %87 !"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was surprised when the iPhone arrived much earlier and in much better condition that I expected. It looks like a new phone. I’m very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Software needed updating, which turned out to be more difficult than needed"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Came in earlier and no defects or scratches. Brand new and I’m very happy easy set up and transfer from my older iPhone. SIM card removal tool was included with charging cord and cube. 12 mini is fast in all apps even in texting and battery life maintains well. Glad I found this seller at a good price, well worth it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I have been very impressed with my new phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El teléfono vino con varias rayas, no está en perfecto estado como otros teléfonos"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Un gran regalo para mi novia, pensó que era nuevo pero la caja genérica lo delató, aún así es una gran compra si no te interesan los manuales, la caja y el cargador original"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I haven’t expected to get an iPhone in such great shape!!! The battery life is 100% which is awesome and no issues have detected so far. Reach out to the seller who also put the protection screen on my iPhone and gave the charger cable. I’m happy with my purchase! 👍🏻"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Enough said. Watch a pros and cons video for analysis of the phone. From my experience this has been exactly ehat i need. After switching to the 10 from 5s i missed my 5s size dearly. Fast forward 4-5 years and i see this is a thing, i bought it and will never look back."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone worked like a charm with straight talk service. I like that it’s 128gig of memory and the 5G works in my area. This is the second phone I bought from Amazon and will buy another phone from Amazon when I’m ready for a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I have bought refurbished phones before and always have been pleased. I am glad I took the slight risk with this one. The only noticeable difference between this and a brand new iPhone is the packaging and the charging cable, which made no difference to me. The phone itself is a huge improvement for me, as I upgraded from an iPhone 5. Battery life is great. I am able to go nearly three days on a single charge. The Apple Car Play is also very nice on this iPhone. The google maps and Spotify interfaces are much better than the Car Play on iPhone 5. And what is there to say about the camera besides unbelievable high quality! Splurge for a gimbal and your video will be Hollywood ready."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love how this is a tiny bit smaller than my old 6, but yet the display is bigger. I like how this fits in a pocket, even in its Otterbox Defender. It came with a handy belt clip. Now I can run all my apps that required 13 IOS or higher, I was out of memory on the 6. Face recognition is nice to help avoid having to put in my password every time."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with 100% battery capacity and no smudge or scratches. The packaging was questionable but fine. So far so good I have no complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone for on the go. 5g and has all the options if you don’t mind missing out on the high tech pro camera. Easy Swap of the sim card and everything worked well."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The battery life is definitely better than my iPhone 6s, but I still have to use a portable phone charger when I am out all day."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No free return shipping. Scratches all over face. Now have to pay $8 to ship it back!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El reconocimiento fácil a veces falla, la batería vino al 94%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love the size, battery lasts all day and haven’t had any problems with it! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Looks good. No scratches or other blemishes.
Functions very well. Good touch screen and all apps work fine.
Battery life in use is very good. Shows still has 80% of battery capacity (as advertised).
Happy with it as a replacement and step up from previous iPhone. Glad I waited a few extra months until the #13 was released and got this at a still lower price. Worth that extra wait."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got this for my son for Christmas, my husband was going to leave it in the box it came in until my son unboxed it for Christmas but I’m glad we didn’t. Husband started setting it up for him so we can add safety features and add it to our plan so it’s good to go but when I was checking it out is when I realized the screen was popping up. I’m not sure how my husband missed this but I’m glad I was here. It also didn’t come with an apple battery and I’m not sure if that’s the reason the screen is popping out, like maybe a size issue, but I’m overall not very happy. Hoping the other phone we order arrives on time and in better condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","very good."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","When I got it and turned it on the battery was at 91% and it’s supposed to be at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Amazing great condition not a scratch on it also came earlier than expected also was unlock I was able to put my own sim worked like a charm thank you so much will order from this seller again even came with a charge such a plus thank you !"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone is amazing for its price and overall a great phone. The only caveat is that this phone is very susceptible to randomly losing data signal despite my surrounding peers not suffering any similar issue."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Funciona perfecto"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love my new phone, thank you so much! This seems like a brand new phone to me and it arrived way sooner than it said it would. I am very grateful for that. As far as looks, I cannot tell it was used at all. For the price and it being unlocked, this is incredible. I was able to set it up with Straight Talk (Walmart’s prepaid service) and everything activated and transferred over perfectly. Merry Christmas to Me!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great Refurbished Phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Awesome works great no scratches or dents looks brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The Phone has a huge scratch on the top speaker, also, the speaker sounds bad and not bad for the science of the mini, but sound like it was bad repaired. But the cameras and the data works well. Hope this help you and beware of the fact that is ""renewed""."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought it about a week ago and it just came in today- it was almost as it wasn’t even used. There wasn’t any scratches on the screen, camera or the black glass. It came in bubble wrap (not the original iPhone box) and it came with an apple iPhone
charger and a regular non branded power brick. When I powered on the phone and set it up I was surprised to see the maximum battery capacity was 100%! I’m not sure if I got really lucky or what. Phone isn’t as small as you think it would be. I would recommend if you are trying to get this phone but want a cheaper price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical at first with getting it, have been waiting to get my hands on one of these for a strong minute. Once I got it, I loved it! No marks, scratches or anything. Totally worth it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","UPDATE: it’s May 16th, 2022 and I still have this phone. It works just as it did when I bought it! It’s in great shape!

Hello, my name is Alyssa! I bought this phone about a month and a half ago and absolutely love it! I have no problems with it whatsoever! The battery capacity was 100% efficient, so it charges just as it should. There are no random shut offs or heating up of the phone! It’s absolutely beautiful in person and easy to use! I would definitely recommend this product to you! I’m 19 and needed something affordable because my old phone (iPhone 7) broke, and, I’m also paying for college."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought a renewed Iphone, and I got a almost brand new phone. said battery was over 80% and it was. Said it would come in 2 days and it did. I doubted it at first but it delivered. So very solid product"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bout this phone as a replacement for my son an it hasn’t let me down yet he has not complained about anything"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I ordered the item before checking the reviews, then had second taught about this item. However the item was exactly as described and I’m pleased with my order, customer service is great too. Highly recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","phone looks great, but I was hoping to continue my one handed operation from my SE. but the screen is too big. I also missed the home button. i’ll buybthe SE 3 instead"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with no noticeable damage and 97% battery life. This seller is amazing!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It arrived on time and everything seemed great, battery health said 100% so i was very happy about that. BUT it doesn’t even last a day (when in specifics it says up to 15 hours), i charged to 100% this morning (10 am), it’s 6 pm and it is already at 11% which i don’t think is good. I’ll keep monitoring but i think that maybe I’ll have to ask for a return…"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Received this phone, activated with my carrier, went to make a phone call and could barely hear anything, activated speaker and still could not hear it, volume was turned up all the way too. Returned it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It renewed but felt like brand new, and came with a charger in the box which new iPhone don't have"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Shipping was a little slow but the phone is like a brand new one, not even a scuff on it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good just has a ton of scratches around the frame and screen. Also the battery is 80% capacity which is weird. When the packaging says 95%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived with a chip in the frame around the screen. The exposed metal is easily visible from arm's length, but a case will cover it. The screen was obviously replaced but has no obvious cracks or scratches.

Cosmetics aside, it works fine and I'm going to keep it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I""m so upset I have not even had very long but just long enough to not be able to return it. I""m out the amount I paid for it. I stopped woking properly at the 3 month mark. When I tried to return it, it gave me apple's number for support. I can't get my money back, and I can't return it. I""m stuck with a phone I can't text on, and the screen bounces."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived in really good condition, almost like new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got the iPhone 12 Mini AND IT WAS TERRIBLE! The package it came in looked like something you’d buy off some sketchy site. The phone came with no cosmetic damage. But i could even get past the activation screen. I tried everything. Even getting a brand new SIM card for the phone. Nothing. The phone wouldn’t unlock and i took it to the apple store and my carrier store. Nothing. I’ve spent two days slaving over this phone begging it to work. Nothing. So i will not be purchasing from Amazon Renewed again. Normally I’m a very relaxed person since i work in customer service, but the fact that this phone is acting like it’s a locked phone and that it doesn’t even have the bypass part the apple installs. SUCKS. I just want my refund and nothing else to do with Amazon renewed. They can have this phone back as it doesn’t even work the way it’s advertised as."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","N/a"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Loved it. A little smaller than I am used to ( was gifted to me). But, it was wonderful"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I absolutely love it, way cheaper then buying new. Screen has 2 micro scratches that you can’t even see when powered on. Two edges were slightly roughed up but once I put a case on it you can’t even tell. Would fully recommend to anyone looking for a new phone that won’t break the bank."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Lo compré re acondicionado y Está como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is in good condition. The Battery life is good, but not as long as I expected. The shipper failed to include a Charger, Cable, and SIM card tool. Phone functions okay. Camera and Face Recognition, work okay, A good value for the money. I might buy another one from them."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is as good as you’d expect on the surface literally nothing wrong with it other than the speakers, if anyone calls me I can’t understand anything they say unless I put it on speaker and ever those are not the best."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone was supposed to have 80% of new battery life, but it doesn't even hold a charge for one day with normal use."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone came with only tinyyyy very very shallow scratches on the back that were only visible if you really squinted at them. Additionally, the battery capacity is 100%. The phone works perfectly. The one thing is that the packaging it came in was pretty sketchy. It was shipped in one large box with bubble wrap on top of it. Like the phone, loose with only film on it, was sitting at the bottom of the box with just bubble wrap and those puffy inflated things on top of it. Risky packaging but thankfully the phone didn't seem damaged by transit at all."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is like new, works fine, easy to set up."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone came looking brand new and works with no problems. Whereas my previous renewed phone had a problem with the speaker, this one works great and no scratches on the phone. Touch screen works fine too."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","iPhone 12 mini was a very good option. Everything function very well. Any problem at this moment (1 Month)
Everything ok with the seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","everything was near perfect. only thing was a tiny scratch on the back that’s barely noticeable. The battery was 96% and everything else works perfectly definitely recommend if you’re looking for a budget iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Compre dos celulares de estos uno para mi y otro para mi hija y estamos encantadas
Llegaron bien empaquetados no con caja original
Sin marcas ni rasgaduras buena estética con muy buena cara de 100%
Me gusta son cómodos de cargar no grandes para mi perfectos"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This is just all around wonderful fun I love the size. Everything functions as it should takes great pictures I just really like it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I received my phone in perfect state, with just some tiny scratches that aren't really recognizable at first glance. It works terrific, the screen is intact, and the battery health state is at 100%. I would definitely recommend it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone came as advertised. It had some minor scratches on right side of screen, but nothing to cry about. The glass screen protector actually hid them. Came with 100% battery capacity, which actually had me surprised! There were no scratches on the sides or back, just some dust. Phone powered right on, and every single feature works. I like the fact that it fits nicely in one hand, and is really fast. The seller responded quickly to my questions, was polite, and the package actually arrived 1 day earlier than I had anticipated! Highly recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I desperately needed a new phone and then I read about Amazon Renewed. I was not sure about buying from them but I saw they had a 90 day return policy so I went ahead with the purchase. I have had the phone now for about 2 weeks and it's working just fine. I could not tell it from new. Best of all it's unlocked, so I am not tied to Verizon anymore should I decide to switch and try another carrier."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Absolutely love it the red is not a red like the iPhone 11 it’s like a iPhone XR coral overall impressed!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Best purchase!!! I was skeptical at 1st but hands down so happy I purchased it, I had to default the storage space when I got it, but once that was cleared I had no problems and still no problems…. Unlocked and everything"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I very much dislike that the listing said renewed but the phone came in a box that was totally smashed inside of its shipping container, inside the box was the cheapest 3rd party cable I'd ever seen that DID NOT work, the phone was totally covered in sticky nasty filth, the screen had a screen protector on it that was shattered, and the screen has a small chunk of glass missing out of it, and the battery lasts about 6hrs while running nothing other than iOS with absolutely no use, with bluetooth and wifi both turned off. I wish the listing had been honest about what the state of the phone was as I would have likely purchased somewhere else."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It is very compact and easy to use"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Pretty happy for what I received. Came like new and camera is definitely an upgrade from my previous iPhone 7. Plus I love mini series which is why I waited so long for Apple to come out with a phone this size and back to the square body design."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 mini was to replace my iPhone SE. I was expecting scratches and dings but this phone looks and feels brand new. I saved about $200 dollars compared to buying it new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","There are no noticeable scratches and the device came in like new! highly recommend if you want a secondhand device!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I wanted to keep a smaller sized phone (for my back pocket) and thought this would be a great model. The price for the quality of phone and camera are amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I fit in mint condition. Even came with a screen protector and wall charger.

So far so good!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks and works well! Very satisfied"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered on time and packaged well. It came in ""pristine"" condition with 100% battery health. would buy from this vendor again. I recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was a little sketched out by the lack of reviews for the product. I also thought, ""how is it possible to get a refurb of the 12 if it's brand new?"" but it arrived today and I'm super relieved. I read someone else's review that said it was legit and I took a leap of faith. So happy I did! It was delivered a day early and is in pristine condition, haven't seen a single scratch on it. I know it's only day 1 but overall I'm glad I made the purchase and you have no reason to worry. Great price and I was able to finance it with an amazon card to pay it off slowly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Not bad overall, it came in Chinese, but it was easy to change the language back. Overall good value, minimal blemishes on phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien pero quisiera cambiarlo con el más grande se puede???"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone is my first iPhone since 2016. This has minimum scratches and works great. This has a very clear screen and very beautiful. Love it and will probably order another for my daughter."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The iphone12 mini received appeared 99% new.
My complaint is the speaker quality is poor.
The sound is ok, but the quality is not nearly as good as a proper iphone12mini.
I would not buy this again. Instead I would just buy a new iPhone12 mini.
It's ok & functional...not too bad.
Delivery was quick."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love my new phone. It looks brand new. The battery life is 100% and everything works perfectly. There are no scratches and it's beautiful. I'd recommend buying it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","A gift for my dota...apparently don't want it...reason...too small...since she has been using standard size..."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is amazing but came extremely late. Was packed poorly. Came with original lightning cable and sim tool!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","There were no visible scratches, dings-looks like a new phone. Easy to set up and transfer everything from my old phone. Definitely would recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Beware. These phones are not new. I knew this before purchasing, but you would have expected the seller to check ALL functions of the phone before placing it on the market. Right? Instead of returning the item, I will have to pay to get it fixed. Maybe a discount is in order here since this item was not 💯 %?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It came 3 days earlier than expected which i was happy about. There are some scratches on the screen but I don’t mind since it is renewed. Other than that everything is good. The battery health is at 100%. I just have to get used to the size since I have been using the xr. 😂"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","OK Folks, I really mean what I say: I received an IPhone 12 mini, which was advertised as „renewed“ with little / tiny flaws … I did not see one of them. It is literally new , battery health was 100% and everything worked super well. I traded in my IPhone XR and I will update this review when Amazon gives me the money promised. But so far , it’s an amazing phone for an amazing price (renew-discount + trade in ) . I can highly recommend to buy „renewed“ from this experience"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This is the 3rd Amazon renewed iPhone I’ve purchased. iPhone looks brand new. No issues. Great value!
Battery health at 85% upon arrival. A bit lower than other renewed iPhones I’ve bought, but still good."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, and came in perfect condition. Highly recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Honestly the reviews have me really nervous however my experience with shipping was great it actually came faster than I thought and but and there are no cracks or scratches in the phone works great"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was a little nervous about buying a renewed phone but reviews for the most part were very positive and the price was reasonable for a new iPhone. So, I went ahead and have been very pleased. There wasn’t a scratch on it anywhere and the battery charges to 100%. I am not a fan of big phones that I can’t get in and out of my pockets easily, so the mini is just right for me. It’s just a tad smaller than my old Samsung Galaxy S6."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone works as advertised. I think it is a good value for the money, but I wish it was $100 cheaper. Fac recognition is working well. It is a little slow sometimes."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was very pleased came with 100% battery life. There were no scratches. Phone was unlocked. I have metro it was very easy to get my line active. Color was as described. I usually don’t write reviews on products but this one was important I want to let everyone know it’s legit and you can rest easy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The back camera doesn't work.. it don't hold a charge long enough and it frozen up on me 2 twice"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Got the phone in perfect quality, much better than I expected! The battery life is 100％ and it is so new, great!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone arrived on time and had only a very very small scratch on the front screen. That being said the scratch is hardly noticeable. The phone work flawlessly and has been my Daly driver for months now."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s small fits in my pocket just what I need."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","phone will not stay on for more than 15 min at a time. ironically im within days of the warranty. Phone will not connect to LTE or wifi. Phone only acts somewhat properly when plugged into the charger but typically cycles one of two problems i've mentioned. The phone looks brand new otherwise and has not been subject to significant damage."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Only thing is sometimes gets to hot but with continued use"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone came with a dent on the corner where the camera is. It did not come with original apple charger. The phone was also dirty."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought this phone to add someone on my line. Just bought a SIM card and all good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was nervous ordering a renewed phone, but it came seemingly brand-new, 100% battery, and not a single scratch on it. Looks and functions great, thanks REXI!

It didn't have the original box (which I don't care about anyway), but had the charging cable and the thingy to open the SIM card slot.

Packaging was very secure, the phone was in an air-filled plastic sleeve, secured in a box, inside the outer box.

Overall, would recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m so happy I trusted you guys because the phone came in great condition has everything I needed… nothing wrong with it and unlocked for the price amazing ! Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Battery didn’t meet expectations. Nice phone but I chose 13mini at last"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Item was in great condition at the lowest price I could find."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great product, battery life of the phone is 90%… it’s ok as they said about renew phones"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El teléfono llegó en perfecto estado y con una mica para proteger la pantalla.."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, great customer service."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good shipping logistics. The only difficulty I had was finding accessories for the 12 mini. The speakers are good, it charges quickly and haven't had many freeze issues with it. I don't like the swipe features but eventually I'll get used to it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Fast delivery. Well-packaged product. Product in excellent condition. Everything is working fine. Approved!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great refurbished phone. Only a small scratch on the screen barely noticeable. Everything works. Battery was as described around 85% capacity"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","i liked the fact that it was easy to set up."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Reviewing from Australia🇦🇺 here.

An absolutely stunning, mighty, and compact iPhone to own! Arrived two days early. Literally brand new as the battery health's at 100% with zero charge cycle. NO cosmetic damage or signs at all, and most importantly it works with the CDMA networks!

Highly recommended for anyone outside the States not only as this model is fully unlocked but also that it features a large groove on the right side for the mmWave antenna (For the most optimal coverage of 5G)."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got a issue with my phone, but the costumer service help me right away! They’re very fast in communication and the phone was overall good. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone I received works perfectly at 98% battery health. The only real negative is that the back glass had some small scratches. Honestly, unless it’s prime shipping and free returns, I won’t buy another used phone on Amazon. It’s too much of a gamble for something so expensive."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone comes with 100% of battery health, just like new one"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","So far I love this phone. Arrived sooner than expected. The battery life is unbelievable especially compared to my last iPhone. After a couple of days it still has not reached below 50%. The face recognition makes it so much faster to unlock. Feels more secure too. All in all a great phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone came in perfect physical condition, not one blemish. Also came a day early, however I did expedite shipping.. The only issue so far is it didn’t come with a screen protector.. I can’t remember if this was detailed or not, but I did see several customers say they received one. If I would have known I wasn’t going to, I would have been better prepared as the phone isn’t insured.."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m happy with my purchase overall. But was pleasantly surprised when the Face recognition worked in a very low light situation. This is my second IPhone but it’s been the first in years. Am liking the functionality better than Android."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El equipo llega en excelentes condiciones y aún con garantía Apple, vida útil de la batería al 100%, recomendado !!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Exelente celular parece nuevo,y muy buena tienda"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone. Minor cosmetic issues but well worth the price and quick delivery"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived sooner than expected through fedex signature service. It came in a different package and the charger is not the original. But that was specified at the purchase. So far my daughter is enjoying her Christmas gift without complaints."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Do not buy it lower quality do not come with Apple box"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone so much and it was sch a great price. Honestly, can not tell it was refurbished!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Super fast, great size and fab camera. Facial recognition is so sweet."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great buy works good thank you."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It's an amazing phone. Finally a flagship spec device on a small form factor. I Have been waiting years for this. Minus 1 start for the ""red"" model because it's not actually red. It's more of a corral. Had to return it and get the blue instead"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","First time I had very bad experience with a refurbished phone. Buttons and some functions are not working at all - and I probably didn't discover all of the disfunction yet.
The side button doesn't work what makes it impossible to switch the phone of or use Siri. Photos can't be send from the library via WhatsApp and other apps. The battery is only good for one day maximum. And if you consider that the price is nearly as high as a new one that are things that are not very acceptable.
Sad for me that I can not send it back as I am now in Costa Rica for work with no possibility to exchange it. Really sucks!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Yego mi pedido en tiempo y forma satisfecho"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","El celular es hermoso, pero se escucha muy bajo"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Really good, looks new and uses like new"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I have small hands and was a big fan of the iPhone 5 size. I’m glad they brought it back"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good but when plugged into a charger it heats up fairly hot. So I’m assuming this was refurbished display unit. I had to return it due to that reason. Other than that the item looked brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was worried I wouldn’t get the phone it’d be scratched, but the phone came brand new. 100% battery life, no scratches no cracks. It shipped within a week as well. Definitely recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Battery while on low power only lasts until 12:00 noon. Says max battery capacity is 83%

Touchscreen is hit or miss depending on battery life. (Have to tap over and over and still doesn't work)

Constantly crashing and resetting. I was looking through my photos and it closed itself and went to the home screen.

Very disappointed in the quality control."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was a little skeptical about a renewed phone, but it turned out to be amazing I can definitely certify the battery life, face recognition and the value for money."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works good for cheap , it's legit"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo correcto, como nuevo, nivel de batería 90%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No scratch, 100% battery, not Apple charger but that is to be expected. Would buy renewed again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","👍"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No complaints. Its nice to have a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","only 87% battery!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Haven’t had any problems or malfunctions, other than cord connections. It won’t accept certain cords, even certified ones. I don’t like the microphone placement. Idk where it is, but a lot of my videos become muffled."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Product was exactly as described; as new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was great until I travelled out of my home city. As soon as I lost cell service my phone would never find a cell tower and showed ""No Service"". Even after turning Airplane mode on and off, and powering the device on and off. I have even tried resetting all network settings to no avail.
Once I had my carrier, Verizon, reactivate my 5G enabled SIM card and it came back to life until I lost service again by simply travelling. Not Good Apple!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This thing is like brand new battery health is 99% amazing for the price!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","When the phone got to me and I opened the package, I was happy to see that it didn't have any scratches or scuffs on it - it was like new. The only downside is that the shipping took a while and USPS doesn't offer the best tracking information. All in all, a great transaction."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","98% Battery Health and no scratches quite worth the $400 price tag"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone came in flawless, 100% battery capacity, and unlocked on the Total Freedom Wireless network. This same network uses other networks that run off of Verizon towers and I’m sure it would work with T-Mobile and AT&T as well. Phone also still has some Apple Care time left on it which is a huge plus! Would buy this phone again if I needed one!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect condition worked great!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I've been trying to put a new sim card in my Iphone 12 mini and it's not even unlocked, when I called Apple it says that it is connected to US cellular and I call US cellular and they cant help me they just tell me I have to get the person who's name is on the US cellular account to unlock it. This is BS the phone works great but what good is it if I can't even use it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very pleased with my recent purchase . Phone in great shape and battery health was 100%!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very happy, our phone came in perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I mean it's a good at a good price. thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Like the face recognition, battery life!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is great for its price. Work perfectly and looks brand new. No scratches. Very pleased."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","at the beginning was a little scared because I've bought an iphone 5c renewed few years ago and it came with several dents but this one came in excellent condition really like new and battery 100% health, I'm really happy with this purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Can’t take photos bc I’m using it, however, I was reading reviews and it scared me to buy it. I trusted my gut and now I love it. It even comes with a SIM card piece so you can open the slot and USB lightning cord.

No scratches, nothing!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone met my expectations"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I'm very happy with this purchase. The phone is great, the battery health is 100%, face recognition works perfectly, no scratches. It's in perfect shape and condition. I would highly recommend it.
At first, I was a bit hesitant because it was my first time buying a refurbished item, but it surpassed my expectations. Highly recommended!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It is the high quality phone that I expected. Performing great!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Batter life is limited vs Samsung. I bought it for the small size. FaceTime works well connecting with my patients. Expensive even though I bought refurbished."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect phone, no issues at all! I am on Straighttalk and just transferred my SD card. So happy with this phone and the money saved buying refurbished. Will definitely be buying this way in the future"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good value and works as it should!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone works fine. But if you buy the unlocked phone, it is NOT compatible with Verizon or straight talk. Don’t buy the unlocked version because it’s not really universally compatible. This is verified after speaking with Apple and Verizon while trying to switch carriers."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I spent hours at my carrier trying to get this phone to work. As soon as I got it I brought it straight over ..having a business to run it was crucial. The thing could read a SIM card at all! Cartier told me it must have damaged antennas
Never agsin!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Almost mint condition. No visible scratches on screen or back. Maybe minor wear on edges but nothing extreme. Would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone I have had for 14 days and it is trash the screen is not very real and today the screen has done the photo below no history of dropping the phone or sitting on it we were sitting in the car listening to music and this is what happened"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","nothing wrong works great, battery 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Arrived very late, maybe FedEx screwed up. Phone quality is good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Love my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My daughter is very happy with this iPhone! I came well packed and looks brand new!
Would highly recommend this seller!
Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I needed to replace our outdated 6S+ phones. I picked the 12 Mini for price and size. We are very happy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Impecables"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phones came in pristine condition! Like brand new! Very, very pleased!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s so mini I forget it’s in my pocket . Had to get the otter box for the phone so I won’t drop it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Iphone12 mini arrived in condition as described. Locked for Verizon. So far...so good."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I like that this phone has a lot of battery and also it charges so fast."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything was great. No cracks one small scratch that’s hardly noticeable. The only issue is the sim tray was missing?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone came quicker than delivery expected and was in good condition! Works great and much faster than XR"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I like it very much although there is still something unsatisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great and excellent customer service! Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","If you're worried this is not a real product or scam, it is not. It came in a plain white box with a random Motorola charging brick and no earbuds. However it had no scratches and was in perfect working conditions. This is a refurbished phone and is presented as such."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It's newer and fresher is all I gotta say !"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Pretty significant scratch left on screen. Do not purchase expected unscathed screen. Battery capacity was at 100% which is a bonus."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No le funciona el speaker"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was working good, suddenly got battery drained, turns off, asks to restore and when connected to the computer you get and error.

Got a message that battery it’s not genuine so I’m not sure if that’s the defective part.

Returning the phone for refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","La verdad muy buena inversión, el teléfono tenía algunos arañazos pero nada importante mente grave, a simple vista son invisibles.

El teléfono me encanto!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Within a week or so of using my phone, it began malfunctioning. It would be unresponsive, freeze, and even called 911 and my emergency contacts without prompting. When this happens I can’t even turn it off. All this has happened in the condition it arrived to me, as I haven’t dropped or wet it at all since opening it. Buyer beware. I have bought many refurbished electronics on Amazon with great results but not from this seller. It is eligible for return and I haven’t attempted to return it because I threw away the packaging and accessories so I cannot speak to their return service."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Size and useability. Great iPhone features."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The perfect, no nonsense phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone was nothing less than amazing! My husband loves it! No visible cosmetic issues and it works like a charm, you can't tell it from new! Love the back tap screenshot/ gestures! Not to mention it arrived so fast! I was amazed and I have prime, but like it was here so quick!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This cell phone does not turn off at times. And I am scared to return it because my information and credit cards are stored in it. So I am unable to delete anything. Help"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone is TRASH :( My 13 year old paid $450.00 that he saved up HIMSELF. It doesn't charge fully and says its overheating at normal temperatures. He literally has to put it in the fridge before he tries to charge it. And of course I would have to wrestle it from him in order to send it back because it's not broken like his old phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","the phone its 100% perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Costed nearly $200 less than a brand new iPhone. Had a few small scratches on the bottom of the screen but disappeared as soon as I put on a screen protector. Besides that looks like new. Battery health was also at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I had my white one going on 6 months with not a single issue and came with no damages also I have a straight talk sim card so it takes almost cell carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This refurb iPhone 12 Mini is perfect. Looks brand new, works great.
The only zonk I’d give it is battery life is down very slightly to 90%.
Very pleased overall."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was clean was lil skeptical but damn I like it a lot . When they mini it’s really small lol smaller then the iPhone 6 s or similar size but overall great buy an I would recommend. Fully unlock added my SIM card an that was it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Looks brand new and I’ve had no problems with it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone was in very good physical shape. After a couple of days it lost activation with Verizon. Local rep tried other SIM card to no avail. Glad it came with good warranty.
I wound up buying a new 12 mini."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The best quality phone upgrade"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Nice screen for mobile gaming"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very badly miss labeled. It was listed as renewed through Amazon so you think you’re getting an excellent quality product. However the phone of course is great I couldn’t have asked for a better phone, But again it was listed as renewed so you would think you’ve got a great quality condition phone when I received it there was a deep scratch for the bottom of the display in numerous deep gouges in the top left corner of the display along with several tiny dents in the side bezel. I had to pay an extra $150 on top of this price to get the display replaced. So I only gave it 2 stars because the seller doesn’t know how to properly list what they have."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The charging port doesn't charge phone reliably. One needs to wiggle the charging wires. If you are lucky, you may be able to start charging."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was excited about my purchase since I'd be receiving a phone in good condition for a great price. I open my package and notice the screen is already cracked! Is this part of the ""renewed"" condition? Sending back immediately"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","A phone for one handed use at last. Battery lasts all day. Light. Fits in any pocket. Super fast. Coming from an iPhone 7, this is a dream. Was a renewed phone but looked and operated brand new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone was delivered as promised in a timely manner and came in perfect shape physically. No visible scratches and worked beautifully for about a month. Then, the phone just randomly shut off and wouldn't charge. Nothing would show on the screen either when a charger was plugged in. Just nothing!
I took it to a local independent repair shop and was informed that there were TWO shorts on the motherboard of the device. One on a capacitor for the charging portion and one for the touch screen. The repair technician said he's NEVER seen two shorts on a device like this before. This device was in great shape on the outside, but obviously had some issues on the inside. I'm not gonna say ""don't buy from this seller"" , but I will say , be aware that you are buying a refurbished phone and you never know what's going on the inside.

Otherwise, this was a learning experience (again) for me and I'd like to share it with others!

Thank you!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Apple does it again with the IPhone 12 mini
Cute little phone with lots of power
Great camera, too
I don’t foresee myself upgrading anytime soon after this."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Do not like this phone at all, it's difficult to turn it on and use all of its functions.
It's too small and more sophisticated and complicated that I need.
I purchased a newer Iphone and it is easier to use."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The product was in good shape, but did NOT accept my Cricket SIM card. The phone is supposed to be unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","To be honest I got this iPhone 12 mini by accident; I meant to get the standard iPhone 12 - but I decided to keep it as it's serving me well"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone as an unlocked, refurbished phone. The phone settings said no sim restrictions, however it would not work with any sim card i put in it. I thought it was a problem with my service so I changed phone plans, and It still did not work. I ended up having to switch phone plans and getting an entirely new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I am very happy with this purchase. I am actually about to order another one. Happy and satisfied with my purchase 😍"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I receive the product in an unknown box that look nothing like an iPhone and when i put the phone in charge it overheated and when on video the phone gets hot."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone is completely dead and has only lasted less than one year. Absolutely ridiculous. Worthless. Do Not Buy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I moved from Android to iPhone mainly because I can't find an Android phone this small or smaller. After using it I switched back. I took 1 star off because I realized I hate iPhones and 1 star off because the screen came with some pretty noticeable scratches on it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I will say I had no scratches nowhere on this phone not on the screen the camera not even the phone had no scratches perfect condition. Thanks a lot love the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Red spot on screen every time I’m in selfie mode"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Love it so far and great price for this phone, what a difference in operation from using my iPhone 8 that I had previously!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone arrived properly wrapped and looks brand new and battery health at 100%. 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The battery health for this item was not satisfactory. When it arrived, the battery health was as low as %86."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Like the title said... I purchased one in ""Excellent"" condition, but it came with sticky residue, clearly from where an old case had been, and there is a small crack on the top of the camera. The volume up button is sticky, this is not acceptable unless it had been marked down to at last ""Poor Condition"". There was also an app pre-installed about checking the features before selling. This all felt sloppy."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone arrived in like new condition. No scratches and battery health at 100%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Obviously not every phone will be in 100% perfect condition, but this one is fin perfect condition with 100% battery capacity."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The Cellphone arrived in perfect condition, all functional, without scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone for my son and we did have some problems with it cyz it wasn't unlocked but were able to talk to them n get it fixed n HE LOVES IT N SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Obvious that the screen was replaced bubbles and bad touch recognition should of sprung for the new one. You get what you pay for."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Slow to respond if it did respond; being the mini the keyboard is smaller"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was looking forward but it arrived with zero charge, took hours and hours to charge, and battery depleted without even using the phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","iphone comes with scratches on the back which I do think it not quite fits into ""looks like new"" in the description. Decluttr (the third party seller) has its own store and the price here is even a little bit higher than the ""pristine"" level in decluttr's store."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Unfortunately had a time sensitive purchase that I can’t return in a timely way anymore. The screen is badly scratched up. The housing has chips, but a good case will cover that.

The screen in the other hand is driving me crazy. How could they call that “like new”. They’re ripping off people and lying."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone looked good worked pretty good it's pretty good but had liquid in display when phone was off"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Por favor exijo una explicación. El Telefono venia con el boton de encendido completamente pegado o al hacer llamadas se escuchaba muy bajo (hice todo lo que encontré en foros y sitios especializados para tratar de subir el volumen de mi parlante y nada). Finalmente lo llevé a una tienda Apple y me dicen que al ser ""reacondicionado"" al parecer cuando instalaron la pantalla quedó pegamente en el boton de encendido y en la regilla del parlante para escuchar. El arreglo vale más que el teléfono. POR FAVOR EXIJO UNA EXPLICACIÓN PORQUE VENDER UN TELEFONO ASÍ ES UNA ESTAFA DERECHAMENTE!. Quedo atento"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","not excellent. Scratches on screen. Scratches on frame. Super bad"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","So, there is no longer a home button, and to take a screen shot requires you to set your phone so that a ""double tap"" takes a pic for you. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes it works when you don't want it to. As you'd guess, this results in many erroneous pics being snapped. Also, when scrolling on the bottom part of the screen, I end up with all kinds of strange things happening. That said, the battery life is great, but the new controls are terrible, making the iPhone even less worth the price. Once this one is done, I'll be moving over to Samsung."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone came within a day, works fine, was flawless in appearance and fully unlocked as advertised. All I had to do was add a SIM."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone looked like it was never touched"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My item is very nice. Good as new. 100% bat and no scratches. Thankyou seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Heck yes I came a few days early and I’ve been using it since the minute I got it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Glad I got my iPhone but it took a while before I got it totally working with a new SIM card from AT&T."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Stopped working days after warrantee ended-- denied any coverage or replacement."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything was going okay enough until I accidentally splashed water on it. The way this company “refurbishes” phones ruins the ingress protection so it is WAY more sensitive to water damage then it should be. NOT WORTH 400 dollars. Buy new or from a friend cause this company does nothing to ensure quality AND THEY RUIN THE WATER PROTECTION. A new phone has ip68 meaning it is water proof up to 1.5 meters underwater for 30 minutes. A light dip took this phone out. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The metal is super scratched on all sides of the phone. I would hardly call this “excellent” condition. The battery health was also at 83% on arrival. I’ll be sending back for a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good Phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","other then that good purchase for price"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It gets inedibly hot while charging, then the screen will dim to where you can barely even see it I guess to try to reduce overheatingthe battery life is also pretty bad"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very Bad touch screen not working properly even not start."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Product was perfect cosmetically, haven’t had any problems."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo excelente me encanta 😻"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","i like i phone its great"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone would randomly restart and the touch screen stopped working. This is our 4th or 5th phone that we have purchased refurbished and the first three have worked out but the last two have not. We had to go out and just purchase a brand new iphone at our local phone company store."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good quality picture. Good prices. Smaller size than iPhone 6s but the screen size is bigger."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Highly recommend. Saved hundreds for a like-new phone. Popped in my SIM card and worked seamlessly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Got a blue one, couldn’t find any scratches or imperfections on the phone. Highly recommend. Great price for unlocked"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Almost all videos that I film on this phone come out distorted and muffled. I regret buying this. My wife’s iPhone 8 is better"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No scratches, 100% battery life, came with charger and block"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great overall product"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I had no issues I highly recommend this dude as a safe seller"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I received an Unusable phone that did not comply with Amazon's renewed guarantee.... The battery service life on the iphone 12 mini that i purchased was below 72%, despite them being guaranteed to be more than 80% on the listing page when purchasing a phone. The phone dies from 100% to zero over the course of 4-5 hours when left completely alone. It appears to not have been ""renewed"" at all.I have bought amazon renewed phones for the past 5 years, and have never had anything even remotely disappointing until now.... This phone was scratched and still dirty when I pulled it from its box."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I don't use smartphones extensively, so, battery life 2 days, form factor perfect, very nice camera.The best iPhone ever."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I like that my battery last longer. It’s great for value cost of the phone. I like the face recognition it’s cool."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Totally value for the money. Arrived early. Battery life rocks and I love the fave recognition feature. Love this one"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone came just as described, shipped quickly, and works great with my mobile service."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Battery life seems to not as strong as new but its ok"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was skeptical of this because the lack of reviews but I was proven wrong! The phone came fast, in good packaging and works and looks perfect!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything was okay and I didn’t have to wait for a long time"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I'm disapointed: Battery health / Maximum capacity at only 90 percent. I expected it to be 100 percent. Also the screen has 2 scratches on the screen; maybe from someones diamond ring?? Should I return this iPhone?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Only had one very small blemish. Overall I’m very happy! Came with 100% battery life and in fantastic condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The product looked fine, just some scratches but something is wrong with the sim card reader, it wouldnt let me use my data, or make phone calls."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The picture doesn’t say many it was too small for her"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excellent value for what looks line a brand new phone. Came early and very happy about this purchase! Recommend!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone is locked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","We sent in an unlocked phone and it was as described but they stated they rejected it due to ""Carrier information on the device received does not match device selected when creating the trade-in order"". We never selected a carrier which was an option since it was unlocked. Trade in is a total scam to get you to purchase their product."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","80% of battery condition"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","the product was as advertised with little to no visble previous use. I would purchase again!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","AllI is fine!! Like a new one"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this renew iphone for my younger sister. However, the iphone I received is really dirty (see photo). I have no idea why this iphone can even more dirty than my 6 year old back-up phone. I understand it is pre-owned iphone so it might have scratch and dent. However, a dirty iphone?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Extremely happy with what i got would purchase again in the future"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Cumple todas mis necesidades y me ha funcionado perfectamente."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone, came in better condition then I expected, looks brand new I was highly impressed! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","You wouldn’t say it’s used. It is like brand new. Great deal."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Despite paying for the ""Excellent"" option I received what appears to have been marked as a ""Good"" and ""Fully Functional"". However, product had visible damage and the phone speaker was not functional. I was scammed. Just go to the store."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I really enjoy my new iPhone. It’s absolutely perfect."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","i know it’s partially my fault that i didn’t read the sizing but it’s pretty small. and it would not recognize my face or anything. i returned it and it was basically a waste of money."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The touch screen strays almost every time 😅"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything is good ❤️"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","In perfect condition, arrived fast!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good little phone just wasn't for me"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s look like new..worth it ..perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect shape, 100% battery life, arrived two days before, minor scratches."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great for the money, I hate payments!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No está des blokiado es pura mentira q venden los teléfonos desbloqueados no en gañen la junte porfavor"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Al dia siguiente que lo recibí dejó de funcionar el microfono, y la pantalla vino rayada.Me salvó Apple ya que le quedaba algo más de un mes de garantía y me cambiaron gran parte del equipo."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I received the phone after one week it wouldn’t connect to Wi-Fi!! Took it in to my carrier, they tried, and wouldn’t it connect. I talked with Apple, bottom line, it would cost $493 to have Apple fix it. I sent it back."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Won’t stay connected to cellular network. If I turn off the phone and turn back on, it won’t register with my provider for 5 hours."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone started to have issues about 2 weeks after purchasing. Would restart or screen would freeze. Took it to the Apple Genius Bar where the scanned the phone Id code. Came up that the phone had been to the apple store twice before with other owners. Employe stated that it has critical internal problems and it should be returned. I bet they will get the phone back and try to resell it as it has no scratches or damage.. Looks like it just came out of the box. Very deceptive."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Battery good no problems here"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded.
 The phone in General is fine nothing is wrong it’s unlocked and everything. The thing is that once I got my phone I opened it and the screen looked weird, I thought maybe if I reset it it would go away but it didn’t the little discoloration on the top of the screen hadn’t gone away. I don’t know if this happened after I opened the phone or it was like this before it got shipped to me."

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Just like new and cheaper"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This iPhone 12 Mini was advertised as refurbished and fully functional, but it would not recognize my Verizon SIM card. I spent 3 hours between the Apple and Verizon store trouble-shooting, and eventually Apple decided it needed a full back unit replacement. Not sure when/if I will have a functioning phone anytime soon."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Just like new"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","bueno como nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No scratches and phone is new!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Mad that I paid more for 128GB and it has way less"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I should have not gotten this refurbished I phone 12 mini . It doesn’t ring while getting a call most of of the time , half of the time the people on the other end say it’s real statically to hear me . I could go on and on with all that sucks with this phone . I am not happy at all with it . My old I phone 7 was much better"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Muy bien asta a hora"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great phone and in great condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Nothing to add"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Was perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It overheats after 10 minutes use. I use it for business and social media"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Really enjoying my iPhone 12 mini blue"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works good but from time to time it freezes the screen. I have to press the power button and unlock the phone, to make it work again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything work fine for the first week and the phone looks new but suddenly it shut off. Now it's in a reboot loop and cannot be reset without taking it to apple. I think somethings wrong with the battery they use. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Returned the phone because it was so small and my eyes are so old! It was easily returned and money refunded quickly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Wasted a lot of time trying to fix this device because I was not sure if it was something on my end. If your not willing to take the chance of something like this happening, I would not recommend this device."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I only got the charger and not the phone, this might of bee a mistake but really wasted my time here. When returning you have to pay a shipping fee"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I paid extra to get an iPhone 12 instead of another iPhone 8…only to realize after getting it that it doesn’t do anything (at least not anything that really matters) that my old phone didn’t already do. I mean, if face recognition is really that important to you, then go for it. But I wish I could get my money back and the iPhone 8."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The charger they gave me did not work. When I did buy my own charger the battery for this iphone did not hold a charge well. I should have bought a new iphone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Perfect"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Nice phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","beautiful device"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Awesome phone!!!!!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Está perfecto!💕"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was so excited about this iphone, but it didn't arrive with the USB cable."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone worked for two months and then my service wouldn’t work anymore, I went to my service provider and they said that the phone was a stolen phone and no longer can be used with any service provider."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Because this phone is from Japan. The camera shutter sound can’t be turned off. Otherwise the phone is good but it would’ve been nice to know before hand."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I did not like the battery condition. It does not last 30 minutes after full charged"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone works great, unfortunately you can’t turn it off… at all, the sleep wake button is completely pushed in. The phone is unusable, absolutely ridiculous."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It doesn’t hold charge anymore just stays at 0% and it was well taken care of with a case and screen protector."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The screen had chipped edges."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This is bad reseller sending iphones that do not work."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was working good but first of all there were scratches on the back and also the battery percentage decreased from 94% to 92% between a few days."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone came damaged and without a SIM card tray then no SIM card would work with the phone regardless of the claim that it’s unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The Face Recognition Didn't Work and I returned the phone immediately. Would not buy ""refurbished"" or ""renewed"" again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","External speaker does not work consistently and sometimes not at all. Microphone does not work majority of times during calls and video calls. Doesn’t matter of using speaker phone or traditional phone microphone. Haptics do not work either. Did update for iPhone 12 mini that was supposed to help speaker issues and it did not resolve the problem. Trouble shooted with Apple through their app and phone call and still did not have a resolution."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Well, this was not “locked to” Verizon, the SIM was locked period. Verizon couldn’t reset the phone and now it’s basically a paper weight. WHAT A WASTE! Definitely returning this nonsense."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself was in good condition. However, it was locked to Sprint, and there was an outstanding balance due to Sprint on the phone.The only good thing I can say is that they did process a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","1. Phone battery had issues, get hot easily2. SIM card was initially unstable and then cannot be used. Verizon staff just told me it doesn't work even it is unlocked..."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Opened up the package and it didn’t turn on. Even after charging for hours it didn’t even show low battery on the screen or anything. Just black"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","When the ICCID doesn’t appear in your Settings> General> About, it means the phone was previously hacked or jail broken. After spending hours trying to get a signal on the phone, I realized it was missing its SIM/ICCID value in the settings. I’m very disappointed that this up to snuff refurbished technology doesn’t go through actual software testing."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This refurbished phone only lasted 7 months. The phone does stay charged and it keeps freezing. Save your money and buy a new phone!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","llega maltratados, varios rayones en todas partes, 86 por ciento de bateria, para 430 dolares que te venden el movil no vale la pena. perdí"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Purchased 2 phones and they looked as good as new and was delivered quickly. However after 3 months and 2 days the back of the 2nd phone started to heat up to alarming levels often and would freeze when it does. Don’t know if this is a hardware or software issue.....yet, extremely frustrating and disappointing to say the least as the phone is basically unusable"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Producto en muy buen estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone was locked and would not hold a charge with provided cable or any other cable."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This is quite disappointing, as one would think a refurbished phone would include a 100% battery health."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Tried to get in touch with someone to explain the phone didn’t work never got anyone. Do not buy from this here"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Not only the battery does not last , the speaker is SO LOW omg, the camera is not even half of what I expected...and the screen is most definitely NOT scratch resistant. So bummed out ... please don’t save a few bucks and end up with this garbage"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was a birthday gift for my wife. It was supposed to be unlocked, but it's not. We're trying to get it unlocked but may have to return it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m extremely disappointed with my iphone. Two days later without ny reason it just turned off, didn’t want to charge or turn on again. Now I have to pay more than 50 USD to get a fixed cuz I brought it to Bolivia, I would like to receive a refund immediately!,,!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It is over heating while on call in few minutes."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","phone had charging , battery problems and obvious signs of use did not look like new as I expected."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","A renewed item does not mean to be dirty and poorly cared for. The battery life is at 89% , the front speaker seems to be all muddy, thats still dirty no matter how i tried to clean It up"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was pretty disappointed when I received a phone full of scratches on the screen and on the back."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Called Verizon and brought to Verizon store. Both said phone not compatible. Buyer beware"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The speakers are busted. Really bad product"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone was activation locked. I had to get a refund."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","To small .. ringer stopped working only had a couple months not worth the money"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Can’t believe seller tried to pass this off as like new.. I tried everything including clean re install after that it was worse! Feel bad for next person who buys a blue iPhone 12 mini from this seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I am returning it. I’m unable to get cell service for it because the ID is unable to be recognized by the service carrier. Maybe there was an issue with the first owner."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This was my first attempt to switch from Android to iPhone. The phone shut down 5 times before I even had it set up (it was fully charged). I knew I should have bought new. This mistake is definitely on me."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","me salio dañado el iphone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","its okay definitely regret buying it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It doesn't work"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I will never purchase a cell phone from a carrier again! Product shipped fast, good quality, and easy to set up. More than happy. Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought an iphone 12 mini last week and it did not came un any box, literally was packed in a small bag.Secondly, screen colors were very warmth. Too yellow to be honest."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Venia muy golpeado, he comprado antes refurbished antes y venía en muy buenas condiciones, pero en esta ocasión es una completa decepción"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Es desbloqueado pero no se puede configurar con cualquier compañía solo con T mobile que es la peor señal y el teléfono no tiene devolución prácticamente se pierde el dinero"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Damage and wrong color I can’t return it bc I’ll be with out a phone for days"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone went out after 3 months, would not charge or stay on, waiting on response from seller."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Premium does not mean the phone is in perfect shape as I know iPhones will be going down in the next three months I was under the impression that I was getting a brand new phone slightly used they put a screen protector on the screen so you can’t see the scuffs and scratches be aware of this do not except a premium device when it’s not premium fair good great whatever because I wanted an iPhone really bad and didn’t want to pay the price that it’s at now and don’t want to wait three months well I will probably be returning his phone or getting a screen protector so I don’t have to see The scratches on I already had a case for this phone because at one time I had bought an iPhone mini 12 same color as I got now I paid $800 for it and then I returned it realizing that the phone is not worth $800 what happened to people saying no There is once upon a thing called the Boston tea party we all know why that party was it was because the price was too high I don’t like being duped"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love ky new iPhone I Totally recommend yahh buy one for sure 5 stars"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It doesn’t read my SIM card but it said it s was an unlocked carrier"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Fake phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Had to return as phone was not unlocked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I purchased this phone back in March and used it up until September 17th when the phone started to malfunction and die rapidly due to the battery not being an apple product. The phone worked perfectly before this and had only a few cosmetic problems besides that it was a great phone. The apple store even with Apple Care+ won't fix the battery they merely gave me the option of attempting to remove the battery and replace it or replace the phone entirely as some other batteries are impossible to replace depending on the type of manufacturing. I recently contacted the seller so we will soon see if there are any further steps I can take to fix my phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The glass of the iPhone came damage doesn’t turn on"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Wifi stopped working after one day. Had to return it."

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","“Renewed to look like new” , mine had scratches all over right side if screen. Just buy the new one."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Equipo dañado muy mala experiencia"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This model is overall a great phone. Easily pocketable and had zero complaints about it. Battery life is good for phone of its size and features.Big issue is that after 18 months of owning it the battery stopped charging one day and only turn on for 2 minutes before restarting. The battery unknown and service required message would show up saying my battery part may not be genuine apple part and not recognized. Brought it to apple certified repair shop and they told me that on average they get two 12 minis a month with battery issues and that it was due to the battery on just the mini not being able to handle the rapid charging from usb c cables but has been resolved for the 13 mini. I was out of luck since it was past the limited warranty and did not get device insurance because I’ve never had hardware issues on any of my electronics. The tech recommended I use the USB A cables for slower charging so the battery try can handle it.Already had to upgrade to the 13pro out of necessity but would have kept 12mini at least until 16 line up."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Don’t buy this item!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It said unlocked but it is not unlocked. and the display screen stopped working"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","no megusto"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","They changed the pieces and the battery is not good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Muy bueno desbloqueado impecable !!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I really had an odd feeling thinking of buying it, but now that I have it I’m completely astonished! I thought it was gonna have a lot of cracks or even a scratch but nothing. It really seems and looks new. I’ve had it for 2 weeks now Everything runs perfect! I love my Iphone 12 mini 128GB!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Purchased this device renewed from Moot. Phone looked brand new and didn't have a scratch on it. Battery was likely replaced as it's at 100%. I'd highly recommend this phone and store. I use this phone as my secondary device for work and while it isn't my main content consumption device, it's fantastic for what I use it for."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love my phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The generic charging cable doesn’t do the job. I had to buy a real one. Phone has been great. A little chip by camera, but not bad."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I just ordered this phone in red on Oct.1....I was a bit nervous about if it would be a like the new one I viewed in the Verizon store a few weeks ago. But guess what? I could not tell it from new! I was pleasantly surprised and have been recommending Amazon Renewed to all my friends! It is working fine and is quite a nice upgrade from my Iphone SE (2018) The screen brightness and battery life so far is amazing. Yes, I wasn't able to stretch the payments over 2 years like at the Verizon store, but in the end I am saving money. Also with an unlocked phone, if I ever want to break up with Verizon, I can with no problem! This has so far proven to be a great choice!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I bought this phone a week ago and it works like new! Came with no scratches or anything which was what I was worried about. It did not come in it’s original box but that’s not a big deal for me because I throw them out anyways. Well worth the money!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. Usually my apple phones break within a a few months (I have 4 kids they tend to through hammers and break things) this phone doesn't even have a scratch on it. One of my kids threw it across, the room. It went through the washing machine/ dryer, and we left it on my cars roof it fell of and didn't even have a scratch on it. My daughter (7 years old tried smashing with a hammer. I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very impressed with the iPhone 12 mini I received, works as it should and looks new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is just fine and does what it should. The camera on the phone is terrible. I am guessing that is what was sacrificed making the small version. Everything is great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I returnd 3/7/22 but not yet got my refund this to small"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","OK this isn't really to do with renewed iphone, but my 12 mini had absolutely awful color calibration. Maybe just my unit but who knows. Way too warm. It can be somewhat fixed using ""Color Filters"" under accessibility in the options, but that's not really designed for that and still can't fix it properly.Other than that the phone is good, I mean it's an iphone you just poke the icons and all that, you know how it works. For a so-called ""mini"" I wish it was a little more mini though."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone I phone 12 min is locked and it was supposed to be a unlocked phone every thing else is good but I need a unlocked phone or to unlocked this phone or a refund because I can’t even activate this phone no we’re"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","What a disappointment for Apple to release such a garbage phone.Easily the slowest processor and most unusable phone I’ve ever owned and I’ve owned hundred dollar phones"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone itself looked great but when I turned it on it said IOS is unable to determine the device battery health. You couldn't tell if it was charging, It kept saying battery health at 0% and then kept shutting off and turning on. I didn't even bother to set it up. The message I got on my phone said this may be due to having an improperly installed battery or an unknown battery. Very disappointing after spending over $700."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","This phone has a lot going for it, but sadly also an achilles heel. It has easily the worst battery life that I've ever experienced in a smart phone. It also charges slower than any phone I've ever owned, smartphone or other. It takes a ridiculous amount of time to charge even with a cable, but with MagSafe forget about it. You get a trickle of power that will take hours to fill your phone even in airplane mode. It's a shame because I love this phone but all it does is die."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","699$ it’s new in stor"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Wont read my SIM card"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","My phone quit working after having it for two weeks. I was able to get my money. But very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was reluctant to switch to an iPhone from android phone, however it is slowing growing on me. Not wild about Apple app availability nor functioning. Still haven't got my old ringtones to transfer and the process to transfer data from Android does not go as smoothly as Apple claimed it would be so it has been a challenge to make the switch.I find Apple's ringtones and notification tones pretty lame and don't catch my attention like what I was use to hearing so I am still working on that problem.If you make a switch plan to spend some time to get it working to your specifications. For me, it is still a work in progress."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","For starters This is my second refurbished phone. I just retired my last one after three years with absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just wanted an up grade. After doing some research I went with the I-Phone 12 mini. I Bought it here on Amazon.The phone didn’t come in the original box which was expected. Not a big deal. The phone condition was 99% flawless. After receiving the phone I looked it over for defects. All I could find was a couple micro scratches on the screen. The micro scratches completely disappeared when I installed the screen protector. The battery life was 100% This phone is exactly as described. It’s a great phone at a good discount. If your like me. You have money but like good deals this is the phone for you.I highly recommend this seller and would definitely buy from them again."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","this phone needs some getting used to, as my first smart phone. There are certain navigation paths that are not intuitive for me to get from one screen to the next. Often I just have to turn off the screen using right side button, and then poking screen to turn on to the home view to get to another app. maybe I'm just over looking something.... Excellent condition for an Amazon 'refurb'."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was so excited and nervous to get this phone. One because it’s refurbished and two because I didn’t know if there was anything wrong with it.I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase. The phone came well packaged. It wasn’t flopping around freely in the box like a refurbished phone I got a year back.It was basically like new. Came unlocked like I wanted. No major scratches, no dents, nothing. It looks brand new! The battery came at 100% capacity and I was shocked and so pleased to see.I decided to get this phone because I needed a bigger screen (I upgraded from an iPhone se 2020) the screen isn’t much bigger so it was easy to adjust to the size.If you’re nervous to get this phone, I say give it a shot. You never know if it’ll be good or bad and customer service gets to you quickly!Edit: I’ve had this phone since may 11th of this year. I received it with 100% battery capacity. Now less than a month later I have 98% battery capacity. I understand this is a used phone and refurbished, but how could I possibly lose 2% battery capacity in less than 1 month? Even as a heavy user that doesn’t make sense. Like I said I used to have an iPhone se 2020 and the battery capacity didn’t drop that quickly in the months of me using the phone. So I’m confused on how this is remotely possible. Especially with the phone being stronger, faster, and much better battery life, along with the A14 Bionic chip. Admittedly, I’ve used a fast charger on this phone a few times, which can be a major role in battery capacity going down time over time, however, I’ve switched from using a fast charger to a normal 5w charger which chargers much slower and is better on slowing battery deterioration. But either way, it shouldn’t suck up the battery health this quickly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","From iX to i12 miniReason i did not go for the 13, cannot disable the washed out over saturated skin tone HDR.. Most pics look like they have a sunburn, i don’t think so Tim..i12 has a different image processing..Easily disable not so “smart HDR”Well why would i want to do that?See posted picture quality with HDR off.. Almost as good as the iSight cams in iPhone X..Everything else is the Same as any other phones from Apple (other than size and shape), it’s the software and apps they play with and restrict.."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I love this phone. It is flawless, and came with 128 GB, not the 64 I ordered. Also, came with screen protector. I returned it because it was creating random texts!!! I thought it had been tampered with. As usual, Amazon refunded 1.5 months later, no questions asked. I bought a new SE at the Apple store. SAME PROBLEM! Random texts! Discovered one can change the screen sensitivity under Settings, Accessibility, Touch, Haptic Touch. You make it ""slow"" instead of ""fast."" I am sorry I returned it! A GREAT PHONE. Fabulous camera too."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I don’t have a picture of just the phone but it came packaged well, in perfect condition. Already had glass screen protector on it, no bubbles or scratches. Put my SIM card right in it- no issues with unlocked status. Really a great purchase I’m very happy with the quality and size. Just about the size as iPhone 6s maybe a rice size smaller. I love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Buying this iPhone Amazon renewed worked out great! I was hesitant at first, but I am glad I did. Phone looks like new, battery health meter shows 100%, and aftermarket charger appears to be high quality. This purchase saved me $200+ compared to buying new and got pretty much the same new phone experience."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The battery rated 100%. No scratches or dings. The small size is handy, but I have to wear reading glasses to read the screen. I am happy with my purchase. I got the $15/mo wireless service. I count on wi-fi and won't use the phone much. I have a PC and a large iPad."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone was for granddaughter for Christmas so no complaints from her"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was amazed at the condition of the iphone 12 mini I purchased. Not a scratch on it and works flawlessly. Battery life is pretty good. Lasts hours longer than my iPhone X. Would definitely purchase again. Much better price than purchasing new. Picture quality is awesome!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Yo this damn phone is the truth! I was skeptical about was I about to loose $400 bucks, but shawty needed a new phone asap! Yo, I was expecting my phone on Monday and it arrived Friday 😍🥰😘 came with everything I needed, was working after an hour of updates and I had a lot of stuff on my SIM card.

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’ve only had the phone for a couple of days. It was very easy to transfer data from my iPhone 8. No visible flaws on screen. Seems to be working perfectly."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I am very pleased with this purchase it has met all expectations. It was really easy to set up from android and because I’m not a heavy phone user the battery life is not as bad as described. I can get through a work day and then I charge my phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I didnt expect that it would be a great value for a renewed iphone. Just a hairlike scratch at the back & thats it. Everything is perfect. Loved it and glad that i tried to purchase a renewed iphone. Worth it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The product came as described! No scrathes or phisical damage! Battery came 88%, the phone works great like new. I recommend it when i can i will buy again my upgrade! And the price super good i save at least 350$!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","100 percent battery! I’m very happy about that. There was one small scratch on the phone. Almost like new! It did not come in an original box or with original charger in case you care about that. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and in the box with the extra accessories. It got here within a few days. It was unlocked as said and came with tool to get your old SIM card out and switch it over yourself. I’m pretty happy. Thanks!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","So far I am happy with everything. I bought 124GB storage because I am home bound and need lots of apps to manage my life. Only time will tell if it meets my satisfaction."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","There are no scratches, and the battery health is at 100%. I've tested the phone for a few days now, and I'm completely satisfied"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excellent phone, good battery and accessories, and not a blemish on it. For its age, however, I would have liked a better price."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is beautiful. The phone came faster than I thought it would. I have no complaints about the phone itself. My only issue is the charger doesn’t work. I contacted the seller and I hope they can replace it."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I understand these are refurbished but they are not even close to being in new condition.. bunch of dents and scratches!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone looks practically brand new. No scratches at all and 100% battery health. Completely worth it over buying brand new. Mine came with the much slower usb a charger NOT a usb c as it reads in the description which is another $20+ Hence only 4/5 for the misleading description."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Amazing delivery! It came the next day.Phone looks brand new exterior and interior it’s running excellent!I’m enjoying my new phone everything is working 100% Excellent job! iPhone 12 Mini ( Blue ) buy one you guys..Do it…Do it"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I’m really impressed with the Amazon refurbished products. My phone is nearly perfect. One minor blemish on metal side of casing, hardly noticeable. I spent 5 minutes trying to find anything wrong with it!"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good phone, and all I needed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Few years ago, I bought a renew iPhone from Amazon, it only have scratches on the side, and the packages wrap with a box. But this time when I open the package, I really disappointed, the phone only wrap with a thin bubbles with the battery charges together, may be this is the main point the front screen have a deep scratches, if I am not in Hong Kong, I will immediately return and get refund. But seems too long time to send and return again"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Looks new 100 battery health"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Took a gamble on this iPhone 12 mini as I usually buy new, but I didn’t want to drop that much $ on a new 256GB version of 2020 device, so I gave Amazon Renewed a chance. The phone arrived in generic box & looks brand new, not a scratch or scuff anywhere. I try to keep my brand new phones looking new with a case & tempered glass screen protector, but this looks as good as my recently purchased 13 mini. For the record, this wasn’t the cheapest seller option & this was one of those renewed devices that was fulfilled by Amazon instead of the seller - I don’t know if that makes a difference, but I would buy more devices if they came looking like this 12 mini. I’m very impressed. Everything works. It’s not sim locked, like my 13 mini, so I imagine it’s unlocked as described. Battery capacity health is at 100%"

The condition was even better than I could have hoped for; it has the appearance of a brand-new phone. Their customer service is outstanding; working out the small shipping glitch and making it right with me. It is not often you find a company that is willing to go the extra mile for their customer, but they did and I would definitely use them again in the future."

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I ordered this phone on tuesday and it was said to be delivered on saturday but it came today in good condition.

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Exelente estado"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Way better than I thought!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","What's better than getting brand new looking phone . Paying half price . I wanted a mini so bad well adopt a phone made it affordable to do so.. and it's perfect looks brand new , works like it's brand new. Very impressed I e been telling everyone to order through them. Order with confidence thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Despite the packaging not being so secure and a little scratch on the screen that you can’t even notice while using, the phone works perfectly fine. 100% of battery life and everything working."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The iPhone seems to be working ok. There’s just too many scratches, feels like the first owner never wore a cover in the iPhone. Also, the camera stabiliser has been noisy and apparently won’t let the camera focus properly. It’s such a shame cuz I really bought this phone because of the Camera, as I really like the quality in the pictures taken with an iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I don’t think I’ll ever go into the AT&T store again. This is the way to go. They make the iPhone transfer and set up dummy proof. Anyone can do it. And. Ow I have the flexibility to change carriers if I want. Looks exactly like a new phone from the store, you’d never know it wasn’t.

I personally like the mini size so it can fit. Over in purses and pockets. It’s about the same size as my old iPhone 6s and plenty big enough to read from the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very nice phone, received in condition as advertised."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Almost new I just think the battery is quick to discharge"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Screen is a little less touchy than id like but overall great phone great experience."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was worried when I placed the order, after reading some of the reviews. I thought I would most likely just return it when it arrived, but it looks brand new and even better, the maximum capacity of the battery is still 100%. They are 20 cheaper now than when I bought mine, but I am so thankful I purchased when I did and got the perfect one that I did."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very happy with phone. Works perfectly and has no cosmetic flaws. Awesome buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I wasn't sure to buy it, but I did it anyways. Just a little scratches on the screen but still looking good. The battery life is 100% so I'm so satisfy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Very happy with phone. Works perfectly and has no cosmetic flaws. Awesome buy!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Couple of marks on outside, battery life at 86% and does pretty fast but good for the price. Face recognition is great and touch screen has good response."

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Thank you"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Arrived in working condition, only the frame paint and back glass had rub away paint and smudge/scratch's. overall great phone works and does its intended features."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works fine. This refurbish item was in absolutely perfect condition. If I didn’t know it was a referral but I would’ve thought it was brand new. The battery life is excellent. The gnu system and the gestures for this iPhone are very different from what I had previously been used to, but I’m getting used to it. The thing I like best about it is the is the battery life. I’ve gotten 11 hours out of this thing!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Firstly, this is the first iPhone I have ever purchased. Before this, I have always only used Samsung phones but I always was curious about the fuss of iPhones. Not only that, but I was desperately wanting a small phone again because a lot of Samsung phones are 6.5 in screens or bigger. That's what made me look into the iPhone 12 mini. I went ahead and bought one on Amazon since the price looked appealing and I should mention that I bought mine from a company called ""REXI"" for $699 with prime. It was on my doorstep in 2 days and when I opened it I was pleased to find the phone in New Condition just like it was specified to be. Even better was when I turned it on & checked the battery life, it turned out to have 100% so I knew I got a quality phone. I took a picture to show the battery life, btw.

I’ve only had the phone for a week but I was already compelled to give a review to let others know that if they decide to buy a Amazon renewed iPhone 12 mini then buy one from “REXI” because they sell quality phones.

Also, I’ve heard a lot of people complain about how long the battery lasts and I have to say, with regular use (ie, YouTube videos, internet, talk, text, etc) it lasts me about 12 hrs. I unplug my phone from the charger at 6 am cuz that’s when I wake up and I use it all day then usually have to charge again by 7 or 8 pm depending on how much I used it. And sometimes I can even get away with making it last a little longer. I think the battery is fine unless you like gaming a lot on your phone then you definitely will kill the battery fast, but for regular use, I think it lasts just fine. I’m really liking the iPhone 12 mini and after being a Samsung user for so long, I’ve been getting used to how iPhones work differently. It’s a good phone and I think I’d definitely like to keep this one."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","battery came with about 87% so it still lasts most of the day, it was unlocked so i could choose my own carrier, overall a good purchase"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I really like the size which fits better in my pocket and hand. I don't like the battery life. I guess because of the small size you need to charge it multiple times."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Was concerned buying an expensive, renewed phone online (site unseen), but very happy with the purchase. Looks brand new. No scratches or dings. Nice aftermarket box (not apple box) with charger cable, power adapter, and sim card tool. Unlocked as described. No icloud, find my phone lock. Was especially concerned about the battery health but it's 100%. Shipped via FedEx. FaceID works fine.
Set it up and did a migration from my old iphone 7 to this new phone. Inserted my sim card and was good to go.
I looked at a lot of phones on ebay but decided to purchase on amazon, mainly because of their return policy. Price was about the same as online auction prices. Worried about getting a phone from ebay and it being icloud locked."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone seems fine, was in good condition but it was a gift so i have noidea how well it functions."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Would buy again"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Just like new I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Even has a screen protector installed perfectly. Face ID and the touch screen work flawlessly as well. 10/10 the price was unbeatable."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Everything works great only thing is i ordered a green phone but instead received a red one other than that its perfectly fine"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Came days earlier than it was expected to and it was easy set up. No complaints at all"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","It’s a beautiful blue 12 mini and I’m thinking it was never used. 100 % battery potential even though renewed only guarantees 80. No scratches, not even minor, works perfectly. Cellular Resource sold it through Amazon Renewed and I couldn’t be happier."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Battery life came in at 89% capacity, other than that everything works great !"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I use the phone every day for work, I love the picture quality and ease of use of the over all phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I see a lot of reviews about cracked,broken screens and back glass.It’s the price you pay for buying renewed,you take that risk.Bought an iPhone XR from Amazon,best phone ever renewed.Recently bought the iPhone 12 mini new from Apple and I love it plus I got Apple care for it.you all need to understand your buying a previously own iPhone and it’s not going to be perfect.If you want perfect buy directly from Apple"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","What this is not a new phone you could fool me by missing the original box and the replacement cord work fine. The screen size is the same as my 8plus I am very please with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The father of my child loves it he said it was a great buy the battery life was even good for a renewed phone (89%) face recognition is great and same with the screen he’s very happy with the purchase he made for this item"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Love how it looks no damage. Fully charged. Love how they packaged it had it fully protected from moving."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I was in Need of a new phone but couldn’t afford it brand new. I was concerned refer bisher wasn’t legit, but this phone is good as new and has been everything I needed. I have had no problems and I have had my phone for two or three months now."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Renewed or not, it looks sick but I’ll update the post after using it for a while"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Phone fits in the middle of your hand. Really small for someone with large hands."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I got exactly what I wanted I turned on the phone set it up and it’s unlocked and all functions work it’s as advertised"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Easy to set up, for refurbished phone , excellent condition."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Product is not what I expected. I am disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The phone is good as new, with 100% battery and like 2 very tiny scratch on the top of the screen, which obviously doesnt bother me (not a single scratch anywhere else). Great purchase and was surprised by the condition, its basically brand new. Also the reason i said to contact the seller, was because I purchased the same item from a different seller and got the korean version (which i returned since the shutter noise was mandatory), so I bought it from a new seller (forefront solution) and asked them if the phone was a US version to avoid another refund fiasco. As such, this time around it was a perfect experience since the phone was indeed a US version. So please check out the different sellers before making a purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","We have had this phone for several months and it’s been great! No problems and shipped quick. Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Bought this for our son. His first smart phone. Looks brand new. These don't come in original packaging, but came with a wall adapter, lightning cable and phone. Pleased. Unlocked, pretty easy setup, and easy to add to no-contract cell service provider. Works fine. Recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","I traded in my 7 and I actually got credit for it. I love the mini. I never liked the bigger phones. They are too heavy and would not fit in my small handbags. The face recognition is super fast and super cool. I have no problems with it. I didn’t set it up with wearing a mask. I’m still learning the ins & outs of the phone but it is so much fun."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Really good and small for someone who wants a small phone"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Great device condition.
No scratches as they said.
100% battery life.
1 Year warranty.
61 days of Apple care+ coverage.
Would love to trade this and shop for my next phone from this seller in the future."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Why is there no Pre-paid postage given for defective iPhone with a large scratch on the glass?"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","solo tiene un detalle estético, un rayon en la pantalla y con 93% de pila, por todo lo demas en excelentes condiciones"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Works great."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien algunos detalles mínimos nada más hubiera deseado que tuviera un poco más de la condición de la batería de ahí en fuera bien."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","100% battery life, no scratches, even an apple official power brick! Super happy with my purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Contras:El iPhone llegó con caja genérica y accesorios genéricos (lo cual descrito en la publicación).Una batería con vida de 81% (como lo descrito en la publicación, pero la batería si se siente vieja)Detalles de uso en los laterales, es iPhone está desgastado y hasta despintado en algunas zonas en especial de los botones por uso; no esperaba un diseño impecable pero en el lente de la cámara se aprecia como si se hubiera caído y la parte de la pintura ya está maltratada y con rebana del golpe (en el borde del lente).Lo peor: Al colocar mi SIM no agarró la red ni de AT&T ni de Telcel , siempre se quedaba en ""red no disponible"" por esta razón fue por la que opté devolverlo.Además al momento de insertar mi SIM en la sección de detalles, no se mostraba mi número telefónico sino otro completamente diferente, lo cual me hizo pensar que el anterior dueño o usó un SIM digital (eSIM) o sigue anclado a ese número, este fue otro red flag para devolverlo.En la caja viene una nota de los pasos para regresarlo, borrar configuraciones y tu cuenta lo cual me hizo pensar que este proveedor tiene muchas devoluciones de producto.Pros:La pantalla está perfecta, mínimos detalles case imperceptibles.El teléfono en si es muy bueno, es rápido (para el año en que estamos 2022) y bonito, pero si se siente algo frágil sobre todo en la parte trasera que es de cristal necesitaría cuidarlo con exceso para conservarlo en buena condición.En resumen es un volado comprar reinfurbished te puede tocar uno excelente con 90% o más de batería o como en mi caso uno con 81% ya dando las últimas, con detalles que si le añaden peros"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","After reading some reviews, I was prepared to receive a phone that is potentially not very clean or poorly packaged. But the product I received was so good that I didn't even need to wipe it over the phone. There was only a tiny scratch on the side that was almost undetectable. Battery health is up to 85%. I am very happy to get such a good phone at such a great discount!"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Vraiment facile à configurer et à effectuer le transfert des données à partir de l’ancien cellulaire. Très convivial. La pile était presque à sa pleine charge et l’état de la batterie capacité maximale est à 91%."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Still learning. It's different than Android"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","En estética está impecable, no tienen ni un rayón sobre el marco y la pantalla en general está bien.En batería llego con un 81% pero aún así aguanta todo el día la batería. Venia incluida una mica de cristal ya instalada"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","funciona como nuevo, solo por unos pequeños rayones en la pantalla el teléfono parece nuevo (es de esperarse por ser un equipo reacondicionado)"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Ok. So I had my doubts buying a used iPhone 12 Mini (Renewed). But the result was definitely not what I had expected. The unit I ended up receiving was in basically new condition. Did some hardware tests to check everything out and all was good. Battery capacity basically unused at 100%. Overall? Pretty satisfied with this purchase! Great experience! (Although your mileage may vary) Thank you."

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","No tiene ni un solo detalle y tampoco rayones incluso la batería está al 100% y con garantía de Apple activa"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Information says battery life minimum 80% but it won’t charge full and does not hold charge. A lot of chips on paint. I would expect something better for 3/4 of price of new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Product is exactly as advertised, phone looks like new."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Todo bien sin detalle alguno, y sin fallas por el momento, la vida de bateria tiene 92%"
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Advertised as ""Fully Unlocked"" but it is NOT. I am not able to use the phone properly and I cannot find a contact seller option. Took phone to Telus retail store and paid $$ to see if they could fix the problem but they were not able to either."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Good value for money."
"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Excelente producto. Llegó en buen estado. Realmente vale la pena comprar productos renovados"

"Apple","iPhone 12 mini","Je n’aime pas le produit car le téléphone n’est pas fonctionnel."

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","El celular esta en perfectas condiciones, está prácticamente nuevo, hasta el momento que lleva de uso, me ha generado buena espectativa."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I’m pretty sure the iPhone I got was unused and labeled “renewed” because it’s out of the original box. Idk if this a good thing or bad thing. Obviously the price is higher than it should be but if you just have to get an unlocked iPhone 13 pro max from Amazon then everything was good to go even came with a charger and cable"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","It is a great phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Very nice, came brand new and I love it"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","El producto llegó en buenas condiciones, pero para la entrega tienes q recibirlo tú mismo y si trabajas y no hay nadie en casa eso es un problema. Otro detalle q el teléfono tiene una pequeña raya cerca de l cámara no es notable, pero en la nota dise PARECE NUEVO, ES COMO NUEVO. 🧐😒. Funciona bien, incluye cargador."

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Parece un teléfono nuevo y lo mejor es que viene libre de fábrica"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Phone arrived and I spent hours setting it up. Had to make a trip to Verizon because the SIM card wouldn’t work. They tell me to contact apple. Apple tells me through remote diagnostics that it has multiple hardware issues and is defective to the point it is unusable. Now I have to print this label, package it, take it to UPS, wait on them to receive it to issue a refund, and wait on the refund to process. Total waste of my time and I won’t be able to get another phone for however long it takes to do all the return process."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","There were visible dents on the dge of the phone chassis where the screen glass and chassis meet."

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I loved everything in it"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Unacceptable the phone was not in good shape. It was already used and tampered with and it came with no boxed or anything and was not the same phone either I got a mini. Highly don’t recommend this product if you are tying to get a iPhone 13 Pro Max."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","this is the worst experience ever, finally switched to apple from samsung and the iphone 16 pro max i bought after spending $1200 cannot get apple care because its renewed where do i go from here?"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","For the amount of money paid for this item, there was several deep scratches on the screen! 😡"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I bought the excellent condition phone that guarantees no cosmetic damage but the screen has scratches"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","the seller described it as an unlocked cell phone, and this is a huge mistake. Cell phone blocked, I'm returning it now."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Bought it thinking it’s operable but instead it’s a defective item"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I received this device today. It came in a white box the inside was shaky. When I opened it the device was dead there was a charger I didn't find a sim remover. After I was done charging the device I turned it on and the device was on the home screen. The apps were different from an Apple service. I have returned the device and will update the review based on the outcome of the issue. I also have a video of the device which has the IMEI and personal device info so I won't post it now"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Product came in great condition and worked fine except you cannot connect it to straight talk wireless"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","BRANDNEW ON APPLE.COM I brought one before I knew they were cheaper on Apple I spent 1,547.60 just to receive it and had camera failure front or back camera didn’t work. Returned it and it was a hassle to get my refund had to do the most. Not even worth 1star."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Nice phone nothing bad came with it but I still love I used to have an iPhone 6 Plus and it doesn’t work I love my new iPhone now I love 2 of them and I’m so happy.Thank you Apple!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Not one mention of RAM!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","El precio es ridiculamente caro para un dispositivo renovado, no le dan garantia de que la clasificacion IP68 quede presente en el dispositivo y puede que ya no sea totalmente resistente al agua... ademas por unos 100 dolares mas o menos aproximadamente, puede conseguir el iPhone 14 Pro Max nuevo de Apple directamente o una tienda de servicio de celular. NO SIGAN COMPRANDO DE ESTE/A ABUSADOR, ni un iPhone 13 Pro Max cuesta tanto!!! ABRAN LOS OJOS!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Storage its awesome"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I had the phone it is the worst it is not worth it’s money. Don’t buy this phone the camera was horrible and it so glitchy and it turns of randomly sometimes and it take hours for something to dowanload"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Apple hasn’t made a relevant change to any phone since the 7. Are you really going to spend $1300 for a used phone? Just get an older one, it is the same thing."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","This is least favorite iPhone I’ve had . Actually probably my last one . Had it only about 2 months and camera is junk . Won’t focus takes awful pictures. Spectrums fix to this is send it to Utah for up to 9 days. It’s not up to me to do the leg work . They basically said sorry for your luck."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","The best Samsung galaxy"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I traded up my iPhone 12 pro max hoping to get away from the green screen problems, and the massive battery drain that was never addressed with that phone. After upgrading to the iPhone 13 Pro Max I found myself in the same situation but only worse, I didn’t think that would be possible, now the screen is green and pinkish purple??? This is just another example of a Millie mouse garbage that Apple insist upon shoving down peoples throat, they don’t care about quality, all they care about is spying on you and selling you polished junk, they lie about basically everything with the capabilities of these devices, this company needs to be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, do you hear that Mr. Cook!!."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Way too expensive to be renewed. Why pay 500 more for a used item and I can get it brand new and save $500. This item needs to be removed."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","You can buy this phone with 1TB memory BRAND NEW from your service provider or Apple for $200 cheaper. Don’t buy this. Way way overpriced, especially for a used/ renewed phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","Toooo high prpice if i have this money i can buya new phone at apple why will i want to buy this phone? Thats renewed？"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","You could buy a new one at Apple Store for 1,099.00 and NEW"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","These are renewed items which means they aren’t even brand new yet cost more than the iPhones that are brand new at apple. Disgusting and fraudulent."

Phone works well, no damages no scratches. Brand new! Quality is top tier."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I like the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","I could get an iPhone along with the protection from theft plan for like $1,500 lol 😂 if we had that kind of money up front, why'd we be looking for refurbished tech?"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","All is as expected"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro Max","The equipment arrived in excellent condition and with the battery at 100% capacity (Iphone 13 Pro Plus)"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Wow like a brand new phone! Thank you! But… always do a master reset and go in to Apple ID setting and change name of phone. Mine still had previous owners name."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Love the look but I got a refurbished one and the person who had the phone before me got banned on Snapchat and snap remembers the IP address so it won’t let me access the app very upset about it"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Happy to say phone got here on time and phone worked perfectly was easy to set up and was infact unlocked so we were able to add it to are network I had no trouble ordering from California thanks !"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Terrible box. No I earphones."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Phone performs perfect . Battery life is on par to the spec for this model. No scratches dings smears or stains. Phone arrives on a plain generic box wrapped in foam papers. Well protected. No apple box, owners manual or anything."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","It came exactly as advertised, the battery health was at 100 percent and everything came working perfectly, the only thing it didn't come with was the original box. But the company even included the power brick (which apple doesn't even include) as well as the original charging cable. It shipped very fast and I have nothing negative to say about it :)"

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I like so much"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","iPhone 13 Pro kept restarting after trying to do the initial set up. Tried backing up on MacBook and was not successful. Took it in to Apple store to see if they could do anything. Guy was honest and told me to just return, there was a history of issues with the phone I had."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Absolutely wonderful"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Beforee ordering I read good reviews. i read one review about the phone being locked. The one i received is locked due to it being on an installment plan with AT&T and it cannot be unlocked. I recommend for the price you just order a new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered a carrier locked phone (tmobile) but the phone didn’t recognize my SIM or an eSIM. Even went to tmobile store and they said it was because the phone was locked to a different carrier than mine. They said it seemed to be an AT&T phone but couldn’t verify. Was such a huge headache."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","It would not let me select united states when the phone first starts up like it would just be glitch out on United States. Super disappointed. Just going to order straight from apple now on."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Phone doesn’t come in original box or original accessories better get new one"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","The battery isn’t good"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","The price for a ""renewed"" iphone is ridiculous. Why pay more at Amazon, when you can get a brand new phone from Apple, and with manufacture warranty?. It just makes no sense"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","In as new condition"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I love this it’s literally brand new it came in with plastic and no scratches and has the original white paper on the screen like if I night this brand new I don’t even think it’s renewed it’s literally brand new"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I couldn't have asked for more. The phone came in perfect condition with no physical signs of use/wear. The phone came at 100% battery health. And on top of that, there was the Amazon renewed store policies to act as a net.

Chefs kiss! :)"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I ordered from the seller, HQTRsomething
The phone was in mint condition, 100% battery, and booted up with the initial setup. I put a sim in and works perfectly. Gotcha gods on my side. My only complaint is the shotty packaging since it was just bubble wrapped and the charger and cable were thrown into the USPS box, none of that amazon renewed box with sim card remover you see on youtube. The end justifies the means so I guess so Im not mad."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Came as described. Very good condition, basically like new. Battery health as at 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Por primera vez compro algo usado y no puedo creer que el celular que me llego sea usado, porque para mi esta NUEVO, no pude haber tomado la mejor decisión. Al principio estaba nerviosa porque leía comentarios de otros clientes que no les había llegado el producto o que no estaban contentos con lo que le había llegado, pero me arriesgue a comprarlo y de verdad que no tengo ninguna queja alguna. Cabe destacar que compre el celular en la condición de re-acondicionado excelente. El celular no vino con ningún detalle, ningún rasguño. VINO ENTERO PERFECTO, con batería del 100%. También en una oportunidad hable directamente con el vendedor y me aclaro ciertas dudas, la persona fue amable y responsable. Muy agradecida"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Apple Iphone13 is the WORST product they ever made.
The texting/writing keyboard is a NIGHTMARE with mistakes. Constantly changes your spelling of words to other words.
BREAKDOWNS CONSTANTLY!!!!! You'll spend more time getting the damn thing repaired.
DO NOT BUY!!!! Probably better off with a 12? Or wait for new 14?"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Really looks brand new, love it"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente compra"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","The product is great!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Excelente vendedor y excelente producto cumplió con mis expectativas"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","If you’ve had an iPhone, you know what you’re getting. It’s more of the same in terms of operating the OS, but in the best way possible. Everything works just as expected and is right where you think it’s gonna be.
As far as my refurb goes, the thing looks in perfect condition. The Apple listed battery health is also at 100% so I’m quite happy with that. I will say that I had to plug the iPhone into my computer and do a factory reset and update in order to get it to work (the iPhone wouldn’t get past the “select a language” screen when I first turned it on). No noticeable scratches or blemishes. I will update if any problems arise but I don’t expect them to at this point.
Oh! One thing I forgot is they actually gave me the official Apple 30w charging brick and a cable, which I think is better than the new iPhones cause they don’t even come with a brick anymore. So that’s some decent savings there!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","I use my phone for about everything and it works great. Love it"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Husband loved his phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Recibí todo en orden, funciona bien , recibí la batería en una condición de 98%"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Llevó un par de días usándolo y hasta el momento ha funcionado correctamente. Parece prácticamente nuevo, no tiene ningún detalle, solo tenía un poco de suciedad en la parte de la entrada lighting y en el receptor/altavoz de la parte frontal (en donde se pone la oreja para hablar). Por otro lado, la batería venía al 90%, aunque me hubiera gustado que viniera con mejor capacidad, ya que leí algunos comentarios donde se los entregaron en mejor condición. Adicional, la garantía ya está vencida :(
La red 5G de Telcel funciona correctamente.

Seguiré probando durante los siguientes días."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Llegó a tiempo, funciona muy bien en Excel tras condiciones, la vida de la batería era del 98."

"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Perfecto, literal es un producto nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","La verdad tenía mis dudas al comprar sin ser un producto enviado por Amazon, a pesar de que se venda por la plataforma, en este caso el proveedor fue Big Box Mexico (vendido y enviado por ellos) sin embargo al recibir el equipo wow, sin palabras parece nuevo tal cual.

- No le encontré ningún solo rasguño.
- Algunos proveedores lo mandan con mica para tapar rayones, este no tenia mica alguna y a pesar de eso no traía ni un mínimo rayón.
- Batería al 100%.
- Con garantía de Apple hasta Marzo del 2023.

Fue sin duda una EXCELENTE compra, recomendado el vendedor al 100% de momento, cualquier situación después si surge algo les mantendré actualizados."
"Apple","iPhone 13 Pro","Leí comentarios buenos y malos, se que siempre es un riesgo comprar productos Reacondicionados pero decidí arriesgarme y sin duda fue lo mejor, el cel esta nuevo tiene garantía limitada hasta agosto del 2023, 100% de batería, se conecto a la red sin problemas, llevo usándolo una semana y todo excelente. Estéticamente sin un detalle, simplemente como nuevo. Valió la pena, encantada y feliz. Exente celular de gran calidad."

I would recommend it lol"

"Apple","iPhone 13","My husband surprised me with an upgrade fom 11 to a 13 and I’m still finding out all the things it’s capable of doing. I highly recommend this phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The phone didn’t come with the SIM card removal tool, but it’s nothing a paperclip couldn’t fix."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Frankly, I don't care enough to return the phone and I already put a screen protector on, but yeah there is some minor cosmetic damage such as; scratches on the back and the front, as well as some minor damage on the bottom right corner of the edge where it was probably dropped in the past. It doesn't affect the way the phone functions but is really more of a heads-up to whoever is thinking about purchasing from this seller"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Great condition works perfectly fine battery life 97%"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Un equipo totalmente versátil, de acuerdo a la descripción del vendedor, funciona totalmente de maravilla"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Came with a charger, and a back that plugs into the wall. Came with 100% battery life and doesn’t skip at all, works like a brand new iPhone. I love how it has 128 GB because my old phone only had 64. No scratches, no cracks, and was very well protected in the box. It was easy to transfer my old phone data on to here. I also love the color, (I got pink)"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Excellent phone"

"Apple","iPhone 13","This is my First experience with an iPhone I had a 13 mini and I just couldn’t handle the smallness of it so I sent it back and got the 13 and I really like the size of it it fits my hand good.. really in love with this phone! Technology can s amazing!"
"Apple","iPhone 13","It came scratched but it’s alright"
"Apple","iPhone 13","You really would’ve thought I received a brand new phone ! The only thing that was different was the off brand charger that came with it. Other than that, no scratches , no mechanical issues, and battery life is at 100%!"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Item was shipped fast from BuySpry. The iPhone 13 condition was not as described in “Excellent Condition”. It has small dent in a corner and multiple chips in few spots. Battery life was 90%. Returned for refund."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Lots to learn with a new phone but I love it"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Too many noticeable scratches and paint chips to consider the phone in “excellent condition”. Upon trying to charge the phone, it had difficulties detecting the charger. Not sure if this was due to the phone or the other person on the line, but when calling someone they couldn’t hear me clearly either. Did not come in the original iPhone box and did not come with any original iPhone power adapter or cables. For the amount paid and the condition stated, I expected better. Not terrible, just not great."

"Apple","iPhone 13","one of the most expensive and best products i’ve bought on amazon! this phone is basically brand new! the battery capacity is 100% and i have yet to discover any problems with this phone! worth the price, 10/10"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Bought it because I cracked my Samsung s21 I’ve used apple products before but this exceeded my expectations. The back is slippery so might want to slap a case on it and battery life (depending on usage) can easily last me a full day might need to turn on power saved mode and decrease screen brightness near the end of the day but you won’t need to worry about it dying on you real quickly"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Easy to set up"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Excelente tengo una semana de haberlo recibido y me llegó en buenas condiciones un par de rayones milimétricos pero muy muy difícil de detectar a simple vista.Lo único que criticaría son los controles de calidad, debido que en la galería venían fotos del dueño anterior, las borré y ya!"
"Apple","iPhone 13","These phones are like brand new... Glad I made the purchase..."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I upgraded from an iPhone 5 and wow what a difference. I didn’t want to spend the money for a new phone so I went with this one, it didn’t have an Apple box but I don’t care about that. I received a phone that was in pristine shape no scratches, nics, or dents. It looked brand new and in fact still has Apples warranty until March. I did go ahead and get the insurance for the phone along with a screen saver and case all in all I would defiantly buy from here again."

"Apple","iPhone 13","This phone came in much better shape then described! Absolutely so scratches whatsoever and it looks as if it is a brand new phone!! It even came with 3 months free Apple TV for “purchasing a new iPhone”! It really is like the phone was never used. Even came with a screen protector already installed onto the phone. Great product and great seller."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I had the IPhone 11 for two years and it was starting to die on me battery wise. So I took a leap of faith and got the 13 on Amazon for about a hundred dollars cheaper than buying it in store. It came perfect. Charger and all, no scratches or anything. I have had no issues in the 6 months I’ve had it."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The phone is in great condition and it works very well. Would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I wanted to wait for a bit before putting my review and I am honestly impressed. This was my first iphone and I don't regret this buy. The phone came and was really nice had a couple scuffs but nothing a quick wipe with a cloth couldn't handle. It works really well and had 100 percent battery compasity. Overall this is something I would recommend."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Everything came out perfectly just one little scratch on the right top corner but it’s barely visible overall the phone works and battery/camera is definitely worth the upgrade coming from an iPhone 8 plus.

I didn’t like how it did not have a iPhone box."
"Apple","iPhone 13","This phone came in MINT condition. No scratches whatsoever. What’s even better is that the battery health was 99%! I’m 100% Happy with this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Batería 100%"
"Apple","iPhone 13","iPhone 13 (unlocked) came in pretty quickly - can't say shipping speed was an issue. However, what I can say is an issue follows.

On taking the phone out of the box and starting it up, everything went well. Past this point, and well, it went downhill. I took my sim and placed it in the phone prior to setting it up and was met with constant ""searching for signal"". I tried multiple times to reset the phone, take out sim, even tried an esim with my carrier to no avail. After realizing my carrier was unable to assist me (and there was no support option with the seller listed), I went directly to Apple. Apple informed me the phone I had purchased had a failing cellular base band. The product details state the following ""This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple."". I understand it may not be certified by Apple, however, if this product was ""professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors"", why then did I receive a product which does not work. If Apple support identifies any other issues, I will be returning the phone and I will be expecting a full refund as the product sold does not satisfy their following statement ""The product is refurbished, fully functional, and in excellent condition. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.""

Also, as an FYI, the unlocked phone I purchased was initially set up for a carrier and was later unlocked to allow all carriers.

Buyers beware.

*will update review based on Apple's response to my warranty repair request*

UPDATE - Apple completed a warranty repair on the phone and it is working as intended. The phone did come with a limited warranty which covered the repair."

She told me her new phone (iphone 13) is working way better."

"Apple","iPhone 13","Phone was in perfect condition and 100% battery life, only down side is cheap charger comes with it"
"Apple","iPhone 13","They gave me a broken phone then did not refund me all of my money because it was broken. Please just go to the apple store and buy one it is only $10 more. These people sell refurbished phones without completely verifying the parts to make sure that it’s useable.

2 weeks after having this phone it shut down on me. I immediately requested for a refund but was instead given a message saying “try resetting the phone”. I took it to the apple store, had it reset and restored multiple times but the phone would still continue to shut off completely at random. It got to the point where it stayed off and would not turn back on. Apple estimated $356 for repairs and saw that the phone already had a history of being taken into the Apple store for the SAME PROBLEM. Other customers of Maverick Wireless had purchased this phone and had to return it for the same reasons, yet they continue to distribute this phone to customers and not providing a full refund.

Not only did I waste hours of my time trying to fix a phone that this company will simply resell as is again, but I lost $400 due to “damages” I did not cause.

I UNDERSTAND IT’S CONVENIENT BUT THE RISK IS NOT WORTH IT :(
I never write reviews especially bad ones but as a young adult in college, wasted money is just heartbreaking."

The camera is super high-quality and I didn’t notice any issues with setting it up. Everything works perfectly and I’m extremely excited about my new iPhone. It comes with a charger brick and a charger along with the Sim card remover."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I WAS skeptical about getting a renewed phone.. but it’s perfect. Literally like it came out of a store brand new. No cosmetic defects or hardware issues I’ve found so far. I am very impressed.

I will update as time goes on if anything is found."

"Apple","iPhone 13","Got the phone back in September, no issues. Then in October the Signal drops and never returns. After some investigation, the phone was reported stolen & blacklisted. Working on the return as I type. Very upset about this purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Worst phone experience ever. There is zero customer service if you beed to switch carriers via Amazon. Nobody will help. I switched carriers from tmobile to ATT and nobody can unlock this phone because it says its with sprint. I bought this as a tmobile phone. Dont buy phones on Amazon. Horrible nightmare of an experience. Never again"
"Apple","iPhone 13","I went to two different places to get the phone activated and was told that the sim was locked and that they couldn't activated that phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The seller charged me for restocking fee which is 20% of what I paid for. I received a defective and scratched phone that’s the reason why I returned it."

"Apple","iPhone 13","The phone was not compatible with Boost Mobile's 5G Network and it arrived with scratches on the top right corner and bottom left corner of the screen."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I love using the phone it has some good things about it. I love making videos for people to look at or watch. Has problems working at times and like hard time when I am on call to hear me when I Face-Time. Also, it’s not that bad but, recommend Android Phone instead of an iPhone because it has some better quality. I think the iPhone 13 is a good choice to have as a phone. The good qualities that go good with the phone is that it is good for taking a picture of things. I love to use the phone because you can play games that you want and be talking, texting also doing other things on your phone as to having any other phone. Some of the other phones are different but, I think this would be the best choice for you to have. The phone is the best thing to order things also it is fun to be watching videos and other things. You will love it but, also have some bad things about it that you won’t like about it."

"Apple","iPhone 13","Pretty color and true to description"
"Apple","iPhone 13","I have used android, iPhone, and crypto phones for the last several years, I would like to say that iPhones and in particular the iPhone 13 are radically behind in every category.

usability on this phone is dreadful, it's not easy to use with one or two hands, the Apple keyboard is ridiculously stupid when compared to an android. It's clumsy, it's too small, the auto correct feature Apple has doesn't work.

on a Google device if you slide, THE, Google learns that you mean THE, and you teach it how you type or how you speak. Apple devices it seems like the purposefully correct too a sixth grade level.

On an android I didn't have to worry about speech rate, or enunciating, because it learned. iPhones and Apple products don't, they stay stupid. There is no adaptation making communication very slow, cumbersome, like you're dealing with a child.

The OS, on an iPhone it's an open book. Are used two FA, crypto keys, pins and passwords and an iPhone and Apple product is very literally a hackers wet dream. You can't keep them out, and have to find third-party security in order to be minimally safe in this world.

Service and reliability, iPhone has to connect to Wi-Fi for everything, the OS is so slow operating only on cellular data. Any other phone on the market Wi-Fi is a secondary option, for iPhone it's mandatory for basic features.

Even with a Wi-Fi connection the OS on an iPhone is comparable to running DOS 3.0, it's slower than dirt, a snail going uphill in a heat storm is faster. YouTube barely loads, tick-tock barely operates, lag is ridiculous and incredible.

now when brought to Apple engineers, they said this was normal. That my phones, I tried multiple, that's just how Apple's operate.

In summary iPhones are the cheapest and least reliable, pieces of equipment on the market but are the most expensive out there. My advice is to buy anything else if you have to do anything on the Internet at all."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The design looks nice but the function design is stupid/terrible, they placed the 5g antenna location in one of the worst possible places to put it, on the right side of the phone below the power button where your hand grips the phone, what were they thinking! 5G is easily blocked and they placed it in a place where it will have extra barriers to go through and also not to mention all the radiation that is being sent through your hands. A much better place would have been on the top edge of the phone or on the back of the phone or on the bottom edge. But of all the places they put it they placed it in one of the worst possible places if not the worst location. And this is true of the 12 series the 13 series and I believe the 11 series (not sure on 11 as I haven't really seen it)"
"Apple","iPhone 13","It’s literally more expensive than a new one from apple"
"Apple","iPhone 13","I am fairly new to iOS...I've been an android user since the very beginning and truth be told, I prefer a lot of that ecosystem to apple's...however, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Cupertino brings to the table and how well they've done it.

Through work I have acquired an iPhone 12 and recently they replaced it with a 13. The phone is virtually identical on the outside...so much that the case I was using on my 12 fit the 13 perfectly. On the outside there are only 2 differences that are fairly easy to spot. First is the smaller notch and on back it's the camera placement. Otherwise, they look the same. This is the pattern that apple has used for a long time and why go and change things now, right? What they changed was almost entirely internal, and you CAN tell a difference.

My 12 booted up from being shut off faster than any android I have ever owned by a pretty significant margin. The 13 is even faster. Not sure how they pulled that off since the 12 was already crazy quick to boot-up, but they did. To give you an idea, I can try to start my iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 Ultra at the same time and not only will the 12 boot up faster, but after it has booted up, I can also start up my 13 and it too will finish just barely ahead of what it took the S21 to pull off. I find that astonishing. Don't get me wrong, I still love my Galaxy, but wow, that is impressive.

I signed up for iOS Beta and downloaded iOS 16. What a wonderful update. The lock screen alone is worth updating your phone. That isn't all, but certainly a nice upgrade. They still can't truly do ""live"" wallpaper (c'mon apple, when are going to finally give in and allow it???) but they come a lot closer than they have previously.

Some of the photo advancements are absolutely phenomenal. Being able to long press on a photo and pull images right out of the background is truly wicked cool and a feature I guarantee a lot of people will get a kick out of. I have used it a LOT since finding it. Seriously, it could be my favorite new tool from iOS 16.

Being able to see a WiFi password on your phone in order to share it with others may seem like a simple thing but it is absolutely a genius idea and something we all should have had access to from the very beginning. Trust me, at some point it'll come in handy you watch.

There are honestly too many cool new tweaks to mention here. Many of them will also be available to older iPhone models when you get iOS 16, but I truly enjoy the implementation on the 13. If truth be told I would have preferred an iPhone 13 Pro Max (I prefer bigger phones in general) but when you get a phone for free thru work, I guess I can't complain now can i?

One additional thing I have noticed with the 13 is absolutely incredibly battery life. It's a smaller battery than my S21 Ultra (by a lot, 5,000 mAh vs 3,227 mAh) and yet the iPhone will run circles around my Samsung battery-wise. Seriously, it isn't even remotely close. OS optimization still ranks as one of the things apple continues to do better than pretty much everyone else and clearly that is still the case and they only increase that gap here. Kudos to apple for this truly amazing improvement.

The truth of the matter is this: android and iOS are blurring the lines between what each can do with each new update...but that's a good thing. Do I prefer my 13 to my S21? Well that is a difficult thing to answer. In some ways I clearly appreciate iOS more...in other ways, Samsungs iteration of Android is the clear winner. As I said, as they blur the lines those differences become harder to define and the truth is, it comes down to which OS do you prefer using overall? For me, I like them both. Some parts more than others, but iOS 16 makes it harder than ever before for me to hate on apple. I really LOVE my iPhone 13...and from a die-hard android fan, that is definitely saying something.

***UPDATE***

I have noticed something I forgot to mention earlier. The 5G service on the 13 is significantly improved over what I was getting with the 12. Not sure why it seems so much better, but it is a noticeable improvement and found it worthy of mentioning.

I signed up for the iOS Beta program and upgraded to iOS 16 and after installing the second Beta update, I have experienced a few bugs that have been annoying and I'm sure will be fixed in an upcoming update. My messages app is all out of whack. Hard to describe, but you start a chat and it doesn't show what you're typing, you have to minimize the keyboard first. Not always, but it's enough and appears unexpectedly that it is a royal pain when it happens.

I am also having difficulty with sending text messages. I can receive them, but I can't seem to send them. I have re-started my phone multiple times to see if it may reset by doing so, but so far, no luck. I had zero issues with the first iOS Beta 16 update...not so much with the second. Just an FYI.

***UPDATE #2***

I am almost at the point where I genuinely prefer my iPhone to my Galaxy S21 Ultra. ALMOST. I still prefer a bigger screen (the Pro Max would solve this, obviously) and as long as I can use an S-Pen that will almost always make me prefer it over anything apple produces.

However...I signed up to be a Beta tester and downloaded iOS 16 and wow...game changing update. The lock screen alone makes it drastically improved. The ability to long-press on an image within a photo and save it almost like a photoshop cut-out is absolutely and unabashedly a fantastic tool that amazes literally everyone who has seen it (including me). My Galaxy though has image erase which to me is even more useful and works surprisingly well...and I use it almost daily. Obviously apple could do this, but I truly believe that apple would rather not add a feature after an android model has had it for fear of looking like they are copying. Oh eventually they give in, but it usually takes several years. As an example, wireless charging took FOREVER to come to apple. I had it with my Nexus 4 almost 10 YEARS ago. Steve Jobs said 3.5 inch screen was the perfect size and as long as he was in charge, the iPhone wouldn't expand...and it never did - til he passed away. The very first iPhone with a bigger screen didn't happen til 2014 with the iPhone 6 Plus and instantly became their biggest selling device to date. All I'm saying is apple could (and should) copy this feature for their phones. Knowing Cupertino, they could not only include it, but improve it considerably. Samsung had it with the introduction of the S21 and the Pixel 6 introduced it too...but for some reason it seems that the fact Samsung had it before them went unnoticed. Go figure. I don't care WHO had it first, I just care that genuinely useful tech be adopted properly and in ways that helps it WORK - which is what apple does better than almost anyone. Face it, no matter what tech is adopted by android ahead of apple, you can bet when the iPhone eventually gets around to introducing it, their version of it will be smoother and probably more reliable. Not always, but in most cases? Yes.

I still wish apple would adopt TRUE live wallpaper that animates whenever your screen is on because what they have that they consider to be live wallpaper just plain ISN'T no matter what apple or anyone else says. iOS 16 does improve upon that with the astronomy wallpaper, but it isn't quite the same. Not sure why apple won't pull the plug on it, either. They do with certain watch faces which are crazy popular, but not their phones. I find that just weird.

All in all I am slowly but surely becoming a giant fan of iOS. The differences between android and apple are becoming more and more blurred with each new update and iteration of each's operating system and I think that's a good thing. Each offers plenty that you cannot get with the other and just the way things operate differentiate what you end up going with and that's okay. I just wish apple products didn't cost 30-75% more than many android equivalents. But hey, this IS a capitalist society and if you can get that price, why not charge it?"
"Apple","iPhone 13","Thank you Apple for the 2' cord and no charge plug. $1000 well spent."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The reason you see so many negative reviews is Apple is very difficult to work with when you have a problem with a feature. You can get their hardware fixed, but if you have an issue with anything else it is absolutely terrible to work with Apple. You have to go through all kinds of authentication. Once you give them the info, they will not provide a support ticket. Instead you will get an auto response from a no reply e-mail address. Apple support is a huge black hole."
"Apple","iPhone 13","First I’ll say that I like the MagSafe chargers that are also available on the 12, besides that this phone is worse than the XS. The camera is not good at taking close ups, the battery lasts a day if I have it on low power mode and close apps I’m not using. 5G is obviously not ready for the public and I’ve never had to restart my phones this often either."
"Apple","iPhone 13","I needed a new phone for a long time. I so pleased with this purchase. It takes good pictures stays charged forever and the face recognition is great."
"Apple","iPhone 13","The battery and look of the phone are like new and it works just as good as a new iphone. all the apps, connections, and features work normally"

"Apple","iPhone 13","It is a refurbished device, yes. But it's still great!. I've had it for two months now, didn't come with any scratches, hasn't had any weird glitch, and has responded great to all the stuff i download it there ! (getting a 128gb iPhone for less than $900 sounds like a fair deal knowing how over priced iphones are lol). The only thing is that the charger wasn't the original one but hey at least it brought a charger and a phone in perfect condition! It is also unlocked and i will finish it paying in December (I got it with klarna), which I feel it's fair compared to the iPhone 11 i got from at&t in 2019 and finished paying in December 2021 with the monthly payments being $150 lol."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Worth it seems brand new definitely worth it and can’t beat the price"

"Apple","iPhone 13","Was nervous to buy iphone online other than from apple or my tmobil store but glad I did! It was 100’s of dollars cheaper and it didnt make my bill go higher in which I was trying to avoid. I wanted to buy a phone straight out! This phone came in perfect condition and works amazing."
"Apple","iPhone 13","Le bas du cellulaire était « brisé » on vois des entailles grise car il a eu des coups.

"Apple","iPhone 13","A los 2 días de uso dejo de cargar. Llego casi nuevo pero evidentemente defectuoso"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","👌"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I love how little it is and it is like the 4 which was a durable phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I order a iPhone from another seller and it was a lemon🍋. So happy I purchased this 13 mini! It works perfectly and I even got it $100 bucks cheaper than the other phone. Very satisfied and officially team iPhone!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","It arrived a day early, had no scratches and it came with a new screen protector already on it, charger cord and the charging box."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Replaces my se 5 which I also loved many years. I am so happy with this Mini 13. The facial recognition is amazing and I do not miss the home button. In the time I’ve had the renewed mini 13 the performance and battery life has been great, like new in fact. Only one or two events where screen hung up however, I’m attributing that to internet connectivity which can occur in my location. The cosmetics were like new, I did notice a very micro minute scratch on screen which is so unnoticeable that I almost didn’t want to even mention here, hardly a defect. Overall if you’re thinking of upgrading with this seller, I would say go for it, jump in and enjoy!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Used/refurbished iPhone 13 mini with very few scratches, only on the back. I'm satisfied."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I was a bit weary buying a phone from a seller I haven’t bought from before, that’s a lot of trust when spending $600. I’ve waited a few weeks to write this review to make sure all was well. The phone came in great condition with no scratches, nicks or dents. Battery condition said it was still at 100% so that was really nice. All and all very satisfied with the seller.

Now to the review of the phone itself.
This is a fantastic phone in every way. I’ve bought budget phones for 10 years now because I couldn’t afford the best money could buy. The last iPhone I had was the iPhone 5. This happened to be within my budget and I couldn’t be happier with the phone itself. I was coming from a pixel 4a so a slight downsize from a 5.7 in screen to a 5.4 wasn’t an issue at all. I truly enjoy a smaller phone as I have small hands and find large heavy phones annoying. To have basically a flagship phone but in smaller packaging has been great. Battery life is actually a lot better than expected and Lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. If your hesitant to get this phone, don’t be! I will update the review if anything changes but so far I’m absolutely in love with my new phone."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Shipping was very fast I received the product much sooner than anticipated which was a good thing. However I think I would’ve been better off buying a new iPhone mini 13 this one didn’t even come with the original packaging it was just bubble wrapped with a charger and cable thrown in for looks. The charging block and cable quickly failed after only a couple of uses and I had to go buy a new charging cable and a new charging block the phone is charging fine now. I actually had to reset the phone to factory settings before I used it?!? I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on something that’s either new or renewed I wouldn’t buy a $650 iPhone from this vendor again."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","La batería no está bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","No vino cargador como decía que venía, lo demás todo bien"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it didn’t come with the actual iPhone box it just came in a zip lock bag and did not come with the proper charger it states it would come with and for almost paying retail price I would of really liked to have the box and the actual charger it supposed to come with which is the usb c to lighting cable but yeah apple is skimming us by not giving us headphones or a charging brick now days they say it’s for the environment but that’s bs only saves them money while the consumer pays extra will update my review if I have to as I continue using the phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Just know if you buy plug for the wall that this phone comes with the old style cord not the new"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Thanks Loreta"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone In Acceptable condition and hoped for the best and i could not be more satisfied. The phone came with zero scratches, dents or cracks and on top of that i got a free screen protector. Apart from the unoriginal apple box and the minor fact that someone else owned this device, i dont see why anyone would buy a brand new phone for 200 dollars more. The only downside to this purchase was the fact they gave me an iphone 12 mini screen protector instead of the 13 mini one but who cares. Totally Worth My Money!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Unlocked phone works good came with a screen protector."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The phone arrived on time and was like a new one. No scratches, no problems. I took the sim from my old phone and put it in the new one and followed along with what popped up. It worked perfectly. So I purchased another one for me. This one was for my wife"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Can’t really rate much yet, as we just received this product a week ago. But of all the refurbished phones we’ve bought through Amazon this is the only that’s ever come with scratches on the screen. A little disappointed in that."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Upgraded from iPod touch - which I still have and use. Got this renewed item due to new not being available. Prefer smaller size that mini fulfills. Actually bigger than expected. Just right."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I’ve always purchased my phones new so I was a little leary about ordering a preowned phone, but I am so happy I did! I ordered through the seller HQTRONIC LLC on 3/21 and received it on 3/24 which was way earlier than the expected delivery date of 3/29-4/4. Upon opening the shipping box, the phone was wrapped in a foam sleeve and there was a new charging cord and plug included. There was not a single scratch or any knicks on the phone…it looks new! I was a little concerned as the battery was at 2%, but I charged it up and battery health shows 100%! I upgraded to this from a 5 year old iPhone 7 which was having issues with the battery and I had to keep it on a charging cord most of the day and I’m so happy that I decided to upgrade. I’m a very happy customer and the savings on this certified renewed iPhone will practically pay for a full year of my Mint Mobile service! Thank you HQTRONIC LLC and Amazon!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Very surprised of the condition of the phone, battery life was at 100%, no scratches or smudges."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","It was everything I was hoping for and more, everything is working like I’d hoped and the battery is at 100% health. My only issue is with a small delay on the buttons but it’s barely noticeable unless I’m really focusing on it. 10/10 must buy"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Works great! Good solid phone with excellent battery life does what it should no problems. The mini size is nice because I can easily control what I’m doing with one hand and it fits in my pocket very nicely. Don’t care for the pink just got a good deal on it and with my Otter Box you can’t tell."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I was hesitant on purchasing a refurbished phone as it was my first time. I am pleasantly surprised on what a great deal it was I love my new phone thanks !"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","package does not come with official apple charger or sim card opener !!
phone is real tho, i just think they should’ve made them bigger"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Almost perfect! The body of the phone is in really good condition I don’t see any scratches or scrapes or dents or cracks the only issue with the body I see is there’s some discoloration in the top right corner it looks like the blue was worn off a little bit and is now silver in that one spot I’ve added a photo in the spot everything else with the phone seems to be in really good condition I just wish that discoloration in the top corner wasn’t there"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","If I didn’t know that I’d bought a used phone, I would have thought this was new. The battery is at 100% health, I can’t find any blemishes on the screen or backing, and everything booted up like new. The package even came with a new charging cable and a charging brick. I didn’t need another brick but it’s nice that it was there I guess."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I liked that it could fit in a pocket easily But I needed my glasses to be able to see it and I just need a little extra space I went to the 13 regular but overall I really like the phone it’s got a lot of features and smooth transitions"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Me llegó en condiciones excelentes, prácticamente nuevo"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The mini was smaller than my old IPhone 6. I thought they were the same size. However I am happy to be able to use all my Apps now! The old phone did not support a lot of Apps. Everything set up great and no glitches in getting it activated! Love it!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I ordered a pre owned iPhone 13 mini. It arrived in 48 hrs after ordering, much quicker than stated by the seller :) This phone was flawless on the exterior. It has always charged to 100% in the 10 days I have been using it. I have been using it. All other features have full functionality. I’m so glad I made this choice. Kudos to the seller and the top notch quality of this iPhone 13 mini!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I needed a new iPhone and I wanted to see if I could save some cash by buying refurbished. The iPhone 13 mini I received was like new no scratches whatsoever. Very pleased. I ended up saving damn near $100 enough to get me a case and screen protector with left over money."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Zero issues, good service and Great phone condition, I loved it."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","My face recognition is not available, my battery life was at 91% and at first i could not download any apps that didn’t come with the phone without a credit card. Other than that, the screen and no scratches or cracks and the phone had no dents."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Like new. It’s been working perfectly for a few months now. 100% battery and processor health. Great buy so far."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","This iPhone turned out to be everything I expected it to be."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I love my phone I got the color pink I order my phone and come the next day pacifically a day early. Which I was surprise and every happy when I receive it if u trying to save money just buy it it’s worth the money it didn’t come with the box which I didn’t really care for and it didn’t come a SIM card which was okay with I was just happy to have the phone so yes u should buy this"

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The phone is perfect, absolutely no sign of previous use. Would buy from them again."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Looks like the iPhone 13 but fails to provide all the bells and whistles of the real phone, I upgraded from an iPhone SE and the face camera picture quality is identical, the phone will sometimes hick up and glitch a little when changing between apps, doesn't come with the iPhone 13 wall papers and settings, did not come with the recent iPhone 12 update.

Walks like a iPhone 13, quacks like one, but just isn't the same. I understand this may be how refurbished phones are but I was expecting it to feel more like the actual iPhone 13."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Buena compra"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The smartphone, taken separately, is in excellent condition. There is no problem.

The only downside is that it is not in the original box. The USB cable is also not original. This is a little bad.
However, the phone itself is in perfect condition."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","It looks brand new and battery is still at 100% capacity, no scratch except 2 hair line scratch on the screen but only noticeable when close-up. I installed glass screen protector and its not noticeable anymore."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Easy set up, no problems, good condition. Worth while purchase!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The phone itself is perfectly fine. But the charging cable it comes with is obviously the cheapest one they could get, but it does work. The power brick on the other hand, feels so cheap and has minimal markings on it indicating its safety, that I immediately threw it in the trash and recommend that everyone else does the same. The listing description also says that it comes with a SIM removal tool, which it did not.

If you're just here for the phone, and don't care about everything else it comes with, then this thing is great."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","a great working iphone. i’m very pleased with the purchase. overall 10/10 to the seller"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I'm not an iPhone user but bought this for my future wife and omg..looks brand new! Can't wait to give it to her in 2month oversea. I hope nothing is wrong since I only turn it on to make sure there's no Crack during shipping. A+ so far until she geeks out on it."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","El cable del cargador no sirve. El teléfono tiene una raya en la pantalla."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I had this delivered less than 10 mins ago and it arrived scrapped. The top right portion was scrapped as well as a minor one on the bottom right. The charging port and cable are not Apple brand, they are second hand brands. I have submitted my return request and will be expecting my money back. Overall this phone took about a week to get here and couldn’t even use it when it finally did get here. I will create an update if my refund is not returned in a timely manner."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Perfect and battery life 100% no dents no scratch
Packaging was a lil scruffy but it’s used ❤️❤️"

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Todo bien, todo lo que comenta el vendedor es lo que entrega"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Absolutely perfect. No flaws inside or out.
Battery life is incredible."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone with great hopes to replace my old Iphone 8 and I thought for a 512gb it was a steal price. After having it for 3 days, it showed signs of defects with the camera and videos (lines on the side of the pictures/videos recorded) I really wanted to keep this phone but I returned it for the reason that it won’t probably last me longer than 1 year and it would show more defects over time. With this experience I probably won’t be buying any renewed phone EVER. Just buy the brand new item and add the extra $80 to keep it working for years than the risk of having a problem within a week/year is high with these type of renewed phones."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The seller sent the wrong phone - i ordered a 13 mini but the seller delivered a 12 mini. I ordered a red phone - the seller delivered a white one. Most importantly, the phone is borken. It does not recognize any of several valid, working SIM cards that I and my cell provider tried in it. Further, amazon made it difficult to return this item. I've thus had to contest the charge with my credit card company. IMHO Wal-Mart provides a better on-line shopping experience."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","received phone in good physical condition, however it is carrier locked and the description clearly says UNLOCKED. for the price of the phone renewed, it is better to buy it new. never again!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","i purchased this product in June 2022 and gifted to my cuisine who is staying in different county . But last week i came to know that Battery is fully drained and not able switching ON.
They are thinking that i gifted poor quality product."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","looks so cheap, not impressive"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","For some reason while I was talking on the phone, the screen just randomly turned green. It never went away and there was nothing on YOUTUBE or google to explain the problem. Took it to a local business that fixes phones but they said that its the screen that is damaged and it stems from the actual manufacturer. They must have used a lower quality screen. It's going to cost me about $200 to fix apparently. It's sad because the phone was great up until two weeks of using it. Very disappointed with my purchase."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","El teléfono es renovado pero debía verse como nuevo. La pantalla tenía rayones razón por la cual realicé la devolución."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Bought an Iphone 13 mini Unlocked right? Well when trying to connect it to my carrier it would not work, kept giving me an error message. Went in and looked…LOCKED with T-Mobile. I had to take the phone to T-Mobile to get it unlocked which was not free. With the money I spent I should have bought a brand new one. The company selling this device was rude and would not listen to the problem I was having. If I could give this company -5 stars I would!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","only lasted a few months and now will not turn on. Phone has entered a boot loop and is now an expensive paper weight."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I brought the Apple 13 mini UNLOCKED! When I received my product it wasn’t unlocked, it was with sprint. I checked my order and it said I purchased unlock. After many phone calls with Sprint they couldn’t unlock the phone because the previous owner did not have the phone for 40 days active with them. I contacted the seller and all they did was ask me for my IMEI code on the phone. My phone is still LOCKED. Will update soon."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Phone has many scratches even thought said it was like new and not great battery life"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Save your money. This phone is awful. It freezes constantly. The keypad is so far off texting is a nightmare. The facial recognition works about fifty percent of the time. It is so slow… my 8 year old iphone 8 was faster"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","No es bueno"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone unlocked and when I finally got it after order was delayed 3 times it wasn’t even unlocked like it said"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The battery life is really good.But the iPhone was scratched and dirtyIt's not worth buying"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Won't connect to my carrier, even though it's supposed to be unlocked. So either it's locked or the sim slot is busted."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Freezes and cuts off randomly, at least 5 times a day. Will be returning soon if problems persist."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I ordered this phone partly based on the reviews posted here and have to say it met my high expectations. My suspicion is that these are possibly just display models that are sold off as for all intents and purposes the phone shipped to me was new. No scratches or blemishes were on it and it has 100% remaining battery life. It had an out of date software version needing upgrading before use which tells me it had probably never been connected to wifi or a cell provider before and possibly never even turned on which is how it appears. The only little drawback that happened is that I didn’t receive the Color I ordered, however that is not the fault of the seller as the Color marked on the product box was not what was inside. Based on my experience I wholeheartedly recommend buying from this site."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","These phones are still priced as if the MSRP is 699$. Apple reduced the brand new price of this phone to 599 2 months ago... making these an awful value at 579$ when you can get it brand new with an apple warranty for 599. I'd not consider a less then excellent condition renewed product at anything more then 450$ at this point."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Good price for a nice and non scratched iphone. Even though it came with no adaptor the seller is supportive to accept return.."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I purchased this iPhone Mini recently (even if not through Amazon). A critical issue keeps coming up that is making me think I've made a mistake. Apple has failed to update to the newest standard of texting. Why? Tim Cook has said ""buy your mom an iPhone"" if you want texting to work nicely with her.So when I get photos texted in a thread where there is even just a single non-Apple device in the group chat, *all* images comes in as low-res photo in the thread. That is an issue that Apple has forced by refusing to update to the RCS texting standard put in place several years ago. This also means such messages are not encrypted (less important to me, but still annoying).So if you have friends on Android, know that your messages with them are not encrypted and you will only be able to exchange low-res images with them -- and this is Apple's actual decision to make the product worse because they want YOU to put social pressure on your friend to buy an Apple device. This is madness, and at times I'm now finding myself embarrassed to own an iPhone."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The raves are seductive, maybe the colors, too. But once inside, unless you are a pixel-fixated addict, many things may leave you wanting. No home button, No touch ID! Camera fixtures protruding from the back side produce a rather scabby look and feel, so unlike a Steve Jobs design, no? And a technically “larger” screen than the SE, but as skinny as a tunnel.All of which, up close in hand, made it easy for me to commit to the SE 2022. Feels solid. Feels fine enough. I will forever miss my original SE, how light in weight. Apple had to blow that, too."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Bought it in excellent condition. But on the phone itself there were a couple scratches. Gunk in a few spots too. Wouldn’t say it was excellent condition. Would’ve bought brand new if I knew. The phone internally is okay. But if you want a new phone In excellent condition id honestly just go to Best Buy and spend like a 100 more to get your moneys worth."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Me hicieron un cambio de color antes de enviarlo por que me equivoqué de color al pedirlo.Todo a funcionado Perfecto.Sin problemas de Envío. Llegó antes de lo esperado. Feliz!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Ordered iPhone 13 Mini in Midnight 128gb. Product came as described in perfect condition with 100% battery health. Even came with an apple brick and MFI cable. Definitely recommend"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Thos os my 6th phone. I have had so m8ch trouble with cell phones. Now I am pleased with the one I chose!!!!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Buyer beware, Amazon guarantee states ""The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.""Mine arrived with multiple small blemishes on the screen that looked like dust/fine hair, but can't be wiped off - invisible from 12 inches away, but who only uses a phone a foot away from their head.Highly recommend the 13 mini -- Great camera, battery life, and performance. I would advise against Amazon renewed though."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Great deal good phone"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Bought this phone a few weeks ago. It came with a screen protector already on and is in pristine condition. No scratches or dings. Battery at 100% capacity. So happy with the phone!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Arrived in 3 days, even though I was worried about the condition of a used iPhone, I was so surprised by the product.Not even a small scratch, camera, faceID is working properly and the phone itself is so fast. Even more shocking that the battery health is on 100.Came with a third party USB-A to lightning cable which I wouldn’t use and with a SIM-tool.I can highly recommend renewed products now."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The phone came in a good condition, although there were small almost un-noticeable scratches. It also arrived right on time. Even got a free screen protector installed! The small form factor is absolutely amazing and I love how effective and efficient it is. I got it in the midnight colour and I am completely inlove!"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","13 mini works great showed up in great condition !"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Absolutely like new. Was given a power brick and new cable as well. Definitely worth it.Give recycled tech a go, it goes a long way."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","The media could not be loaded."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I bought the phone brand new with Apple's great guarantee and care, overnight Fedex shipping and paid less than this phone used on Amazon. If the phone were priced at the right price, I would likely have bought it here."

"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I love this phone it works great it rlly fits me because my hands are super duper small overall good quality everything works i suggest getting a fast charger to charge your phone because my charger works with the case !"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Good warranty perfect looked brand new for being refurbished no network issues very small good size"
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","THIS WAS ALMOST A NEW PHONE.Guys. If you are looking for a ""used"" phone that's literally not even used, this is where you get it from. Make sure you select the refurbished in excellent condition one. It is practically a new phone. Only thing is, it did not come in the OEM box. But oh wow..... So cool. A white box that you won't really care about. Yeah. This is basically a new phone. Still an Apple product, but a great one nonetheless."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","This case feels like much better quality than the otterbox case I previously had installed.Pros: It feels like good quality. Perfect fit. Materials definitely seem better than otter box. The edge has much better grip feeling than other cases I’ve had. You get to show off the color of your phone..?Cons: the raised edge around the cameras doesn’t seem like it is much higher than the camera lenses."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","Phone is not refurbished or renew as stated in description. Phone came in all scratch up on screen and housing. Highly not recommended. Don't have time to return and go back and forth as I am in need of a phone. I don't expect a brand new phone but I expected a refurbished phone as describe. Very disappointed."
"Apple","iPhone 13 mini","I normally don't go for renewed or refurbished phones since I like to buy them new but decided to give it a try here since it was much cheaper than what's on Apple's website. I wasn't disappointed. Received all the parts and for all purposes, I can't tell that this phone has been used before"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I love the phone so far its a 5 stars but only thing that i dont like is that it doesn't have earphones if they would come with the phone i will give a 5 stars"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Hi, I am seeking assistance to have my purchased Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (new) replaced. When I initially began using this phone, I realized it would sometime feel warm, which I did take seriously. This phone worked for 37 days; then it started freezing/sticking and coming on and off. It then came off completely, and after giving it some charge, it only shows the word 'SAMSUNG.' The power button is not responding despite numerous tries.
I bought this phone to continue my online classes, which will resume in the first week of September 2022. Your consideration in the matter would be much appreciated. Thank you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","It's very good but it's no 5G.so that's wrong description. Battery life is to short."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","I said before that I really like the phone, but, thought it didn't have an sd slot. I was wrong, it is on the back of the sim card. At first, I was concerned about it being ""international"", however, no problems."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","Good value for money, battery life. But having a difficulty installing Samsung Pay since it says its an issue with where I bought the device. This was extremely unexpected and is a bit frustrating."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 FE","前のスマホがOS９で止まってしまっているため新しいスマホが欲しいということで購入しました。
以前のスマホはHUAWEINOVALite２という物を使っていたのでそれと比較しながら話させていただきます。
メリット
・画質がかなり綺麗
・処理速度が速いのでほとんどゲーム等で落ちることはない
・容量が多い
・多機能
デメリット
・スマホが大きいため片手で手が届かない&重い
・デュアルSIMではない&マイクロSDとSIMを挿入する場合かなり入れにくい
・説明書は日本語表記がない
・通信会社などによると思うけど電波表示が２、３本しか立たない
・充電器が海外せいのものであるため初心者などにはかなり分かりにくい　など

以上が少しの間で分かったことです。購入をする際にこのレビューが役にたったのでしたら嬉しいです。"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is amazing! I had a
galaxy s8, the phones pretty much work the same however, the s20+ 5G is so much faster and the screen quality is excellent. The phone came 2 days after I ordered it. It's fully unlocked. You just need your own sim card.. It's a great buy!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this new phone during Amazon Prime days and was unable to activate it with my carrier (Verizon). I had to take it to the carrier's store and was there for an hour, when they discovered that the 5G phone had a 4G Sims card. I had to go back to the store a second time for another hour to finally resolve this issue. In addition to the time spent in these stores, the store had to contact their support time both times - with wait times 18 minutes or longer for them. I finally had to purchase a 5G SIMS card and they had to uninstall and reinstall the activation. I will never buy any electronics from Amazon in the future, even the protector I bought for the screen in a 'bundle' was defective and I had to purchase a new one as it came out of the box with a large scratch across the middle of the protector. There is a reason why you get such a 'great' deal on these products - out of three products included in the bundle, two were defective. Although I purchase items through Amazon weekly, I am going to be purchasing a new TV in the next week and I will not purchase it through Amazon as I know there is a good chance it will be defective as well. Very disappointed with my own decision to go through Amazon instead of my own carrier for my new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The Galaxy S20 line is the last line of Samsung Galaxy phones that has room for an external micro SD card.
The cameras are great. I've loved all of my Galaxys, but unfortunately, this one is refurbished and not new as described."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","5G
This unit ""SM-G986UZKAXAA"" Only supports US 5G carriers, 5G will not work Europe, Asia, or the middle east.
The listings and official samsung product site simply say (5G ready). But fail to mention the 5G bands.
This model supports the following bands: nr2600(n38,n7), nr3700(n77).

Snapdragon
This model is the SnapDragon variant, which is the preferred version over the other variants which run exynos.

E-Sim
This model does not support E-Sim.

The specs listed for this device are contradictory.
The product listing title says ""Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G Factory Unlocked"",
but under product information it says:
""Wireless communication technologies 4G"".

Amazon Customer Support has confirmed this is the 5G unit. I've requested the product specs to be updated and corrected so that others dont get confused, this has not been done. Looks like Samsung doesnt care about the accuracy of its listings."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is a very good phone. I really like it.
Main disadvantages of this phone are:
- lack of 3.5mm headphone jack,
- it's pretty big, and it's not easy to use with one hand,
- it's very expensive, and honestly it's doesn't worth more than $1000 at all, there are a lot of other good phones with the same or about the same specifications for way lower price.

What I don't like is that phone arrived in questionable condition. The box of that phone was definitely opened before, so actual description was supposed to be ""Open box"", but not ""New"". This phone also had a lot of dust on it, things packed inside of the box were definitely packed not the same way as they usually packed from the factory, and screen protector that was already applied on this phone had couple of little scratches/dents on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone, ready to use, unlocked, just plug and play. it appear to have some glue dots on the screen, after detail inspection, it has a front plastic transparent cover that can be removed. after this. phone looks and feels great. works perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is ""okay"". The only real problem I have with it is that when it comes to making calls sometimes I can't hear the other person at all. I have to restart the phone and then it works most of the time. As we all know it's not a very good phone if it fails to do what it is primarily needed for."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this phone several months ago. Battery is draining very fast and autofocusing is a nightmare!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The in screen fingerprint reader is fantastic. I have very very sweaty hands and my old Google pixel always had issues. Granted this also struggles at times with my sweat but not nearly as much as any other phone I have tried. Works great the first time dry and easily within 2 or 3 tries wet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Excelente equipo. Pero ya se rayo la pantalla y los audífonos originales mala calidas solo le funciono una sola corneta. Es engorroso el proceso de reclamo."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I like it it was sold by Amazon and is unlocked so you can activate it to any phone plan and or service it arrived quick and as expected of a new phone with everything included"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","upgraded to this from the s9 and I love it. the only thing that feels like a downgrade is the fingerprint reader. the one on the back of the s9 was faster and rarely took more than one try. the reader in the screen seems to be more picky."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Good product, but didn't arrive with the wireless headset that was supposed to be included when I bought this phone.
Is it delayed?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Fingerprint reader only works sometimes. Battery life is great. With the new 21 coming out, it would nice if this would have been less."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone is great, do not use the fingerprint reader or bixby......Fast processor, camera is great.....4 stars only because no phone is worth 1K."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Having upgraded from a Samsung s5, I am now operating on all cylinders! The features and the battery life are great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Face and fingerprint recognition is horrible. I had a One Plus which worked flawlessly. When you pay a thousand dollars for a phone I would expect the recognition software to work flawlessly like the less expensive competition model."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I use this phone primarily for gaming, solid performance! Usually lasts me 10+ hours of straight gaming settings on high, then of course I have to plug a charger in. But 10+ hours, you can't beat it."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great phone! Fast, long battery life, big screen. Amazing camera! Super fast charging."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","only issue is fingerprint reader doesn't work with screen protector"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this device in August 2021 and at the end of September of 2021 it stopped taking a charge. It said there was moisture in the device, even though I did not have it near water and it's supposed to be waterproof. After putting in a bag of rice for a day, it turned back on and took a charge. Then one week later it did the same thing again. While trying to see what we could do, we found out that they sold a device to us that was out of warranty, which was not disclosed in the description. Do NOT purchase this product; it's not worth losing $500+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this phone for all the features it has but am extremely disappointed with the phone. The finger print scanner doesn't work half the time and the battery life is terrible.

I ended up returning this phone because it's not working as advertised and for over a thousand dollars no way would I put up with this.

I bought the phone unlocked but it still came with bloatware you cannot remove like Facebook, Netflix and some random Samsung apps.

Very disappointed and not what I expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Return"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Wife loved upgrade. Phone is awesome."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","My phone came absolutely spotless. Just like new! Everything works great! Came just as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Works perfect on uscellular. No issues with phone at all. Love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Awesome phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I don't know why Samsung insists on using the curved display. It is incredibly weak. I have owned this for less than two months. I put a protective case on it. However, there is no way to put a screen protector on it. For one, the screen is curved. And secondly, the fingerprint recognition on the case prevents screen protectors from being used. My phone just fell on top of the cable for my charger and shattered. A cable...on top of a soft carpet... Not concrete. Not metal. A cable broke the phone screen. So my brand new expensive phone is going to need to be replaced before it gets worse. Needless to say, my next phone will NOT be a Samsung until they stop making that curved display. How does Samsung think this is acceptable?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","With this model something its wrong.Its very bad working with Lyft application. Every time when I get alarm notification from Lyft app my music from phone stoped play in my car media device and continue play after 7-10 second. Sometimes even disconnect Bluetooth after Lyft notification. I try all ,but nothing no help my.My old Samsung 9+ worked excellent,I never had problem."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Amazing phone 10/10 I highly recommend buying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love the phone and had no problems with it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","So for so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone keeps acting up keeps saying no Sim and not letting you call out thought it just needed to be updated but still having the same problem which sucks to pay so much for a phone with constant issues"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased this phone for my husband he finally used it and the screen is cracked you can see a pixe line across the phone. Videos are recorded but they don’t come out correctly they freeze and they speed up the phone ruined some very precious family videos. If i could return it i would but we never open the phone till last week. It was in a brand new non open box. never had this issue with any phone. very disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone takes great pics. Unfortunately, I had to return the phone because it had 3 chips in the glass. I'm still waiting 2 1/2 was later to get a refund."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This listing says unlocked, but I received a sprint phone. It wouldn't take my AT&T SIM card and the settings show brand as Sprint. Don't trust it if it says unlocked. Edit: second time I bought this phone specifically because it said ""yes at&t and factory unlocked"". As soon as I turn on the phone it said Verizon. Stop advertising factory unlocked when it clearly is not."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","If you use Samsung pass be very careful it is very difficult to wipe and factory reset I've never had such difficulty wiping a phone to factory reset I must have changed my password 10 times very very difficult Samsung get to work on this crap it's so much easier for Google and way easier for iOS but for the Samsung phones that are coming out buyer beware."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I don't know what is wrong with the phone, but the screen is especially susceptible to scratching. 4 or 5 scratches in less than a month.

I have owned a galaxy s3, s5 and s8 before and have never had this problem. Garbage for a $1000 phone.

No, I don't have a screen protector. I have never used one. I have never needed one until I purchased this piece of garbage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Decent phone, horrendous camera software.

Using this in July 2020 fully updated: pictures are excessively auto adjusted with no options to disable. Especially when the subject is people or pets (90+% of a cell phone cameras use case!): saturation gets absurd, colors are brightened (skin tones are made pale) , and everything in general just looks like a cheap filter from a 3rd graders first attempt at photoshop."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This is a terrible phone. The fingerprint reader is very finicky, it is almost impossible to take a screenshot, Android Auto doesn't work, and the Samsung apps are garbage. I feel ripped off. Don't buy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It worked for 2 months and the display went black. Sent text to seller with no reply."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone is fine but don't buy from Amazon. 1000 dollar phone and not a single cushion pack, beat up box. Yes Amazon, I love my new phone pre-drop tested."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Phone froze and can not restart, charge, or unlock it 19 days after return date
expired."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Leave it to samsung to F up a android phone.
Now to get rid of this samsung abortion of a phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It did not come with complete items"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Battery is bad"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I am a Samsung lover and was genuinely excited for this, I even pre-ordered it. Not even a week and I'm sending it back. I can't take it anymore. It's buggy like a prototype, not the most expensive phone on the market.

Id take an old disposable camera over this supposedly next gen camera system. It gets a ""warning, camera failed"" notification several times a day that makes the camera inoperable until I restart it. I can take better pictures out of a moving vehicle with my crappy Pixel2 after my dogs lick the camera than I can with this thing in a tripod. It has a bizzarre focus, color tints, and lighting problems, even if you turn off all the enhancing features and line up the dots exactly like it orders you too. If you don't hold it still for a solid 10s before and after a picture, the picture will be blurry like you're waving it around at a rave. Dark light just plain doesn't work. I'm uploading some of my best pictures as an example.

In addition to the camera problems, it already has dead pixels despite never being dropped and always kept in a case/screen protector. And the screen is almost impossible to ""hard press"" even with the sensitivity turned all the way up, so much so that I have to set it on a hard surface and lean on it.

And all of that is BEFORE I spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to return the thing, because it's well within the return window but they're subtracting a mystery ""adjustment"" of $300 and no one can tell me why, just that I have to call back after they've failed to credit the whole amount back and fight it then. (I bought it directly through the Samsung website)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","The phone is great. The super bummer is the position of the fingerprint reader, so inconvenient and annoying how dificult it is to get the phone to read it, maybe without any screen protectors will read better but we all need screen protectors"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I didn't buy this phone through Amazon like I do for 95% of my purchases but I can tell you that it's incredibly fast, it's picture is incredibly detailed, the volume level is spectacularly high (and clear), and I'm so glad I bought it. I have the S20+ and feel like I am working with a new age machine. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the slightly inconsistent fingerprint and facial scans. This new ""super fast"" charging that I do through the plug, not wireless, charges up my phone ~90% in 1 hour, and that's sick!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Has full spectrum of US 5G. So far have ""only"" gotten 300 Mbs in the US on T-Mobile. Hoping for better in future, but that is still great.

Has pre-installed screen protector, which is a great advantage, especially as I find customer-installed screen protectors do not last.

3X optical zoom is very useful.

Wish it had dual SIMs in US, but the SD card is great as only need the 128 GB model and can add 256 SD card (or greater) at small additional cost."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","My headline needs no explanation on how much I love Samsung phones. Reliable phone, and can go for upgrade every 2 years for new features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought this phone directly from Samsung during their pre-order, traded in my S10+ .... I have this phone running through Boostmobile, no issues whatsoever... Superfast phone, battery life is great..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It's a phone. Camera is capable of having a wider photos to capture what your eye can see, but you usually don't use it. Everytime I bought this I keep thinking, why in the heck did I buy 1200 phone for something my S9+ did just fine but needed a new battery? Bixbi is horrible. Want to turn off the phone? They took out the stupid power button for bixbi."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I bought it for $750 off of Microsoft's website."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Hate where the finger print sensor is and it doesn't work properly. Hate the drop away buttons. They should have keep the old style buttons, or at least kept them where they were. The fingerprint sensor in the middle of the screen is SO stupid, it takes me at least 3 tries to unlock the phone. Digital buttons would be fine the drop away would be ok, the finger print sensor being where it is is lame."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I wanted to love the Galaxy S20 plus. It was my first Samsung phone since the Note 5. But the battery is NOT long lasting - this phone could not even keep up with my 19+ months old Huawei Mate 20, EVEN WITH aggressive power saving turned on medium settings. So no 120hz screen, no QHD resolution, reduced brightness, no apps running in background, and CPU throttled to 70%, and the battery life STILL couldn't make it through the day without needing a charge. I'm guessing this is because of all the redundant Samsung apps and bloatware making the operating system very inefficient. The poor battery life renders most of the premium features like the screen and processor moot. Battery life is the single MOST important spec for any phone - the spec upon which all other specs depend.

The other problem is the in-screen fingerprint reader is slow and innacurate, definitely a step backwards from the dedicated fingerprint reader on the back of the phone on my Mate 20. I don't know why manufacturers thought it was necessary to put it in screen in the first place. Trendiness over functionality is something I'd expect from Apple.

Trying the Oneplus 8 and hoping it's decent now that Huawei phones have become casualties of the US-China trade war. Otherwise the P40 Pro would have been my top choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I'm sure there are a lot of good things about this phone, but it is terrible at everything that matters to me.

The camera is TERRIBLE. Everything is washed out, or the brights are blown out. Also, you can't play music and take a video at the same time - what is this, 2015? Camera is the most important thing in a phone for me, so I exchanged for a pixel 5.

Also a bummer that there's no fingerprint reader (well, there is, but it literally never worked at all). The face recognition was not as reliable as the fingerprint reader on my pixel - it didn't recognize me if I was wearing sunglasses or in bright light or holding the phone at a slightly different angle from the pictures I took to set up face recognition. It seems like face recognition is where most people want phones to go, but I prefer fingerprint because apps with biometric locks use fingerprints but not face."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I have been a lifelong Samsung phone user. I bought the S20 5G+ for Sprint from Samsung.com. The phone does not have as good of a reception as the old S9+ I traded it in for (tried to trade in anyway). It has a tendency to drop a lot of calls where I used to have constant reception.

On another note, Samsung promised me $350 for my trade as long as the screen wasn't cracked, it powered on and it was factory reset. I did all the above. Samsung said they would not give me the credit because ""You did not disable your personal security locks, including the Factory Reset Protection or Activation Lock"", which was not a requirement, and, BTW, should have been taken care of when I did the ""Factory Reset"". Given Samsung's shady business practices, I will no longer be a Samsung buyer and I hope to spread the word to encourage others not to buy Samsung. If they treat people this way, who knows what else they will do?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I was so excited to upgrade from my S7 edge. Unfortunately I have been super disappointed and actually wish I wouldn't have switched. First of all, it's way too big. I thought the s7 was perfect size, this is just a little bit bigger but for me it's WAY too big. Finger print scanner is garbage. I pretty much always just have to key in my security code. It does have face recognition but I'm wearing a darn mask most of the time. I have already had a couple of glitches that required I restart my phone. Camera is awesome, sound is awesome for phone speakers. Is it worth the almost 1500? Absolutely no way!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I have always loved Samsung phones but this one is expensive and full of problems. It often completely freezes and sometimes it goes haywire, opening and closing apps randomly and on its own without me even touching it. I frequently have to shut it down and restart it. I thought it would take great pictures but my iPhone 8 pictures were better. Extremely disappointed in this phone. The screen cracked even after putting a protective coating on it and a replacement screen is 250 dollars. Don't buy this one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Sounds like this device doesn't have eSim enabled. I am looking for a phone I can switch between carriers as I travel to different network areas. Guess this isn't it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Still totally breakable...no point in this pretty, but ridiculously expensive phone if you have to buy a bumper for it. :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I'm a big note guy but the latest note to me is not worth the money. They use a plastic case on the new note. Unless you really want the stylus I think the s20 and specifically the plus version will give you everything you need in a very premium phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Tengo usando el teléfono varios meses en los cuales he constatado de primera mano su impecable desempeño..
En Ecuador no tengo ningún problema con las diferentes operadoras telefonicas.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Good product but wrong vendor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It's the most all-in-one phone that also has 15 hours battery life with moderate use. I use my phone all day because I've grown to depend on it. It's much more laptop like and productive than an iPhone. I'm sure I would love an iPhone but I'm not social and I depend on my phone for work and doing various jobs at once, also sideloading. My last phone was a note 3 and I did my best to compare its features like GPS and antennas and display quality between the two. I had hiccups with it but that's just because I have extremely high expectations for the price. Good news is you get a lot of freedom with how to make it work the way you want to and the updates are getting better. Do yourself a favor and get the plus not the ultra. The dual pixel camera is just better than the 108mp telescope."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It came really fast and has the charger and block and everything, that's awesome guys thank you!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I purchased a galaxy s20+5g used from this seller, it showed up looking brand new, came mostly charged as well, after swapping the sim, I was good to go. +1 Reputation point, from a very satisfied customer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","It was time for me to upgrade my phone and I finally decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20+. I've wanted one for a while and I'm really glad I made the decision to get this phone. I love everything about it. It is everything you want in a modern phone and it is just great quality. It was a great buy and I was provided with a lot of help from the seller. I had an issue and it was resolved in an orderly and appropriately fashion. They responder back to me fast and helped me solve my problem. I'm so thankful for the help from them. Now I have a new phone that I absolutely love and I don't regret buying it one bit. I most definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade to a newer phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","Great purchase. Fast delivery. Phone was in excellent condition. No issues. Excellent price. No complaints over here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love it left Google pixel and came back home to Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","This phone is an amazing achievement in modern technology. As in a refinement to a efficient and powerful moblie computer. In what I would assume its purest form to date. GOAT resolution and refresh rates. Overkill RAM and plenty of storage. Great feel and light in the hand. Smooth and quick operation. Camara is more than the average person would need. And I got it like 400 bucks off renewed (pretty much brand new). Idk what else you want me to say? You should buy this phone..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus","I love my new phone, its really fast, battery life is awesome, the 5G speed is something else with cricket wireless, love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","So I bought this as a renewed premium and then when I did some test on it I realized that the battery capacity was under 80% and they probably said it to be over. The screen this large and for how much going on underneath there. This battery has got to be better than that because you're just charging it all day"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I am a big fan of the note phones, I bought the note 20 ultra, liked but Just out of the box when I stsrted setting it up I heard and felt something moving and ratling inside when you shake the phone, for and expensive electronic devise that is unacceptable, how did it pass quality inspection in Samsung factory, I am Galaxy S series fan, I know things like that happened but for the wait and times spent to get this phone this is dispointing to me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Loved the phone. Works well after 3 months with it. awesome camera, battery is ok. I upgraded from at note 10 plus and wanted a peen as well this one is awesome and such a big difference between those 2 phones. Would buy again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","This Amazon renewed is just as good as new, you can't tell the difference other than price. It doesn't come with charger or cable but that is a Samsung thing not Amazon. Don't bother buying from other sellers who claim renewed. This worth the extra $100 over those sellers."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Case fits well and is easy to hold. It's designed well to protect the phone. It's simple but boring."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","wow"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","3 stars for missing item. Everything else is in the box except for a USB connector which is supposed to be included :

Included Components

Handset, Data Cable, S-Pen, Ejection Pin, Quick Reference Manual, Terms & Conditions/Health & Safety Guide, Handset, Data Cable, Ejection Pin, USB Connector"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Good phone even though it's Samsung Certified refurbished it feels & looks brand new. I've had it about a month at the time of writing and the only issue I've had with it is it seems to hang when switching between multiple apps quickly or navigating at a pace the phone cannot keep up with.

I don't take pictures so no comment on that.

5G is still a lackluster promise of a service that LTE is demonstrably superior to on a day to day basis. So if your buying this phone for 5G, don't expect much; actually, expect your service to take a small but noticeable downgrade in connection speed. My LTE downloads are faster than 5G. Whoever is responsible for 5g implementation must still be working out the kinks. The tech is underwhelming at this stage.

That being said, i bought this phone because of the size and hardware. Both meet my expectations so Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

UPDATE 4-21-22:
So ive been having issues with bluetooth connectivity dropping out randomly while I watch or listen to anything while using the phone. Its still rare a.t.m. but when it happens, its fairly irritating. Im still very happy with this phone but thought i should update this review, FYI.

Update 4-24-22:
Hotspot no longer works. Bluetooth no longer works. I now understand why this POS was discontinued. Im pissed becasue i need this phone for work. Im now left with an ""ultra"" expensive paperweight. I'll try to RMA it under Samsung refurbished warranty but i wont hold my breath. I do not recommend anymore because this phone will break with regular use. Phone broke within 2 months. SMH what a waste of money.

UPDATE 6-28-22: I took a hammer and smashed this P.O.S. into pieces. I feel sooooo much better now😊"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","good touch screen perfect condition the whole phone very good condition, i tried everything before installing my data durability battery, charging the phone, so far everything works perfect that's ok"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I had an iPhone XR, it's WAY better than this trash. Android is garbage. You can't turn off notifications, so if I'm on top of a ladder fixing a roof I still get to hear about what the newest video game is.......if I fall I'm seeing.
Voice recognition does not work
Facial recognition barely works, barely, usually not.
Fingerprints barely work, I update them often and it still is trash.
I drive a lot so I need a phone to just work, no games, no nerdy crap where you must push a bunch of buttons.
I'm a grown man, I need a phone that works like a phone should. If I want something that always has to have my attention, makes stupid noises, doesn't know who I am, and you need a user manual thicker than the Bible.....I'd still be married"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Not a mark on it. No issues with Verizon switching over. So far, so good with the battery and performance seems fine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I purchased the re-certified Note 20 Ultra. The phone is in excellent condition. I am really impressed. With the high cost of mobile devices now a days, this was worth every penny!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","great product had it a month no problems"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","After a few days, the screen changed to this blank flickering green screen. I was unable to retrieve a normal screen, unable to get/make calls, unable to turn off or even do a hard reset. The phone is basically useless now. Thank God I didn't reset my old phone and trade it in or all my info would've been lost. Will never buy a refurbished or renewed phone again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Devuelto el mismo dia ya que el dispositivo llego con la parte trasera rota"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","do not buy . The battery is damaged. It charges hard and loses charge quickly. It cannot be returned if there is damage. Zero zero zero. I lost my money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Recibí el teléfono pero no recibí los auriculares ni el conector USB y en la descripción de articulo dice que vienen incluidos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I love the samsung note phones. When you drop them, they are designed to launch the s-pen out of it like a friggen escape pod, so that you lose it and need to buy another 50 dollar stylus.

Not to mention the keyboard never registers the correct letters i type. And the fingerprint reader is absolute trash. 90% of the time i have to use my pin to unlock because the biometrics cant read the finger print ive had since i was born. Oh and sometimes it just drops connection to mobile data.

My next phone i wont be buying a Samsung product, they have become worse than Apple. Speaking of Apple, im so over Samsung watching every move Apple makes to see what they can get away with, but charging more for the phone every year."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","With most high-end phones surpassing the grand limit, it's easy to recommend this deal. As a renewed phone, it's technically not as new as when it first released, but you'd be fooled. The physical condition is flawless, and this still feels like a phone that could have come out today in 2022. The only major gripe I have with this phone ever since it was released was the fingerprint sensor reliability; Since the actual sensor is so small, there will be missed attempts here and there. But with being one of the last phones with SD Card support AND MST, it's a small price to pay for a fantastic phone. Camera still performs near best in class and performance is no different than the newer models."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","everything is in fantastic condition except the battery. I don't know if the battery is not new or if this phone originally last as it lasts with me.(battery)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Una compra fácil, mucha potencia, calidad de construcción y el slot para ampliar la memoria es un plus que ya no viene más. El último gran note."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","This phone is amazing. Super fast. Lot's of cool features in the camera and photo editor. The graphics are great and the infinity edges are a nice touch. Good battery life.
Bought magnetic case and one for my car. So easy to access my apps on Bluetooth.
Over all way cool."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I love it everything works perfectly 🥰 💞"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","I purchased this Note 20 Ultra as an updated replacement for my Galaxy S9 Plus, which has been an excellent phone, but not 5G capable. So far, I have zero complaints about the Note 20 Ultra, but I do wish they would include a printed copy of the User Manual."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","For the price of this phone it cannot be beaten. I hands down absolutely love this phone it has so much utilities to it and great battery life and performance that it's a hard to find anything else that is compared to it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","El equipo llega renovado directamente por samsung. Hasta parece nuevo. Con todos sus plásticos y protectores. El procesador es snapdragon. Esta casi a la altura del nuevo s22 ultra y la verdad es que no le pide nada. E incluso te ahorras casi unos 8 mil pesos. Funciona bien con la red de telcel. Sin duda lo recomiendo. Solo trae cable de datos pero. No recomiendo comprar el cargador ultra rápido ya que desgastas tu bateria. La carga rapida incluso noto que la hace mas rápido que en mi S10+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","Llegó en perfectas condiciones, sin ningún detalle"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra","El equipo en excelentes condiciones el único detalle es que dice que incluye audiculares y cargador y solo venía el USB fuera de ahí en perfecto estado todo y es snap Dragon 5g 128 GB 12 de ram"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Been seeing several reviews that the phone is not the best. Obviously there is no prefect phone. So for this and considering its price. I would rate it five star. Its fast and the fingerprint is super fast as compared with my previous Samsung Note I had. The size is perfect not too big and not too small. And has almost all the features of a flagship apart from few not so important to me. Generally its nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this for my husband. The delivery was so fast and was right on time! The phone came as expected which was exciting. My husband broke his phone and was very discouraged due to all his clients contacts. But, set up was fairly easy and the phone is still doing the job after what we thought was going to be temporary. The one we got had some issues keeping the Sim card snagged but a overall its durable and works good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like the phone, it is fast and has a very sharp display, however, it lacks certain features which when buying a phone for this price, one would expect. Several lacking features include no eSIM support, no sd card memory expansion and no ability to set differing notification tone on an individual basis - all these were supported on my older (and less expensive) Samsung phone. If those missing features were included, I would rate it 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.

The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.

The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.

The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.

The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.

The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.

The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.

The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.

This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't had any issues that I couldn't find a fix for on the internet. The biggest thing was data not working, but I found out that it was an issue across all Samsung devices that can be fixed by toggling airplane mode on and off.

Battery life is decent. I haven't tried finger print or face recognition yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was easy to transfer my apps and photos. Seems to get signal better than my outdated LG. I thought about getting an iPhone but can't see putting that much money in technology that becomes outdated so quickly. I've had Apple and Android they both have their benefits. I chose the less expensive option this time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was a bit hesitant about buying a phone through Amazon but I'm so glad I did! Not only did Amazon have the best price but it did not disappoint. I also added on the protection plan at a good price. Battery life is good and that's with me using my phone all day for emails, social media, etc... If you're debating on buying a phone from Amazon this is your sign... buy the phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No battery charger included. Real bummer! New connections on the S21 require newer charging cables. Therefore, when my phone arrived with 6% battery could not prepare it for use. Wireless charging in my vehicle was too slow. Looking forward to using a fully charged phone. Amazon description should have included this caveat."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Edit: I'm a super heavy user. I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm. And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly. Love the phone. Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in florida

mark Edit: one month in, and I love it! Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.
I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them. Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.
Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected. Signal is great on tmobile. 5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off. but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.
Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors! Updates get sent all the time. So worth it!

And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens. For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance. S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9. The rest is pretty similar.
---
It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.

I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.

I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.

I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.

I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!

I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.

Please note, red it definitely an orangey red. I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.

I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.

Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full. The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow. The only things it didn't bring over were paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.

I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.
Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.

Happy happy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery will go down to 50% after just 3 hours of use… don’t waist your time and money on this."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is my second SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone. My first one had problems that two different experts could not solve, so I sent that one back to Amazon and got a replacement that works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Came as the description stated, unlocked. It was easy to set up, everything about this purchase was worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took awhile to transfer everything but works well once everything was transferred. Patience"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A wonderful product! I would recommend it to everyone. The photos clicked with it are superb. So are the videos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my mom, she is so happy with her phone, huge internal storage, amazing Camara, light, super fast to navigate in it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.

For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.

The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.

Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.

The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.

Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.

The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.

I apologize for the rant, lol.

Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.

You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.

This phone can also block Apple ID. These crazy females won't be calling me from different phone numbers anymore at 3am in the morning!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worked for the entire time. Took forever to break it"

Strong connectivity.
Fast for her useage.
Awesome photos, and good assortment of photo taking options like 2x optical zoom camera, slow motion video, etc...
Extra memory chip to store all those photos and videos. When its full, just but a new chip in.
Highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","However, the sim card tray had to be replaced. In the description for the open box option, it stated something along the lines of it's been handled, some signs of wear. Benign enough. However, the sim card tray was bent and that had to be replaced. NOT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION when the seller promoted the open box. All in all, the open box price was still a great option even with the additional $11 we had to spend on the new card tray. So far, the phone is performing well and suits my husbands needs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This Samsung GS21FE 5G is the fastest and most detailed cell I've had...We like them a lot and the battery last about 10 hours of continued use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no issue so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I never buy the latest thing. Too expensive.

But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal. I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.

Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.

It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier. Haven't really pushed the camera yet, but even after moving my pictures from my old phone, looking at those older pictures is better on this phone. A definite and noticeable upgrade.

Overall pleased with this phone. More pleased with the deal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","PROS
- runs fast and never freezes or crashes (have owned for 7 months)
- plenty of space and not overpowered by bloatwire as I though it might be (got 256 verison fyi)
- NFC works great and I've loved this feature (coming before from phones without it)
- customizable fonts, displays, screens
- great call quality, multi-tasking on phone between apps, and was easy to set up
- good size and weight
- camera is beautiful! I have taken some really great photos with this and gotten so many colors/details. Also love the features and the modes.
- 5G phone (happen to live in an area where I get some of this lol)

CONS
- battery at first (I had to switch to 60 hz display and now I get basically a full day/8-10 hrs)
- no headphone jack
- sometimes the pull out side draws are hard to pull out with touch
- adaptive brightness didn't work well/anytime I'm outside I have to turn it up quite a bit
- the photos and screenshots all save to the same place, so I have to sort through to get to my pictures sometimes and selectively import photos to google (serious hassle, but that's just how Samsung has it set up)

OTHER
- honestly, from the moment I bought it, I forgot how long I had it and had zero regrets after purchase. VERY HAPPY and will definitely buy another samsung (pending reviews) when I want to upgrade phones again . . . though I have a feeling this one will last a while.
- Would definitely still recommend this phone! :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just received this phone and was disappointed to discover there is no charging block. It comes with a USB C to USB C male to male cable. All of my charging blocks accept a standard USB A cable so I have no way to charge it without purchase a new one. I have had difficulties in the past finding USB chargers manufactured by Samsung and I would like one with the correct specifications for my phone.
The description page does have a section that says ""What's in the box?"", however it only says TBD. Guess I learned my lesson on that.

Also I was not notified of delivery like I am with nearly every delivery so this phone sat out on my front porch for nearly 24 hours before I noticed. Thankfully it did not get stolen but it was sitting out in wet weather.

I have yet to activate or use the phone, since I cannot charge it but may change my rating once I find an appropriate charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery goes down quickly, Phone is charged in the morning 100% by the time i get to work for 8:30 it's down to 52% just listening to music, my older phone holds charged way longer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased a Samsung S21 to replace my Samsung S10 Lite that the screen cracked on and was starting to have a few technical glitches. After using the new S21 for a few days I can almost live with my old glitches and cracked screen. For a brand new phone this battery drains QUICKLY. I am already going to be ordering another fast charging port so that I can get through the day at work AND the evening before charging it fully at night. Another feature that isn't working is the face recognition. That isn't a deal breaker for me since I am content using the fingerprint option, but something I've noticed just the same and wanted to mention in case you relied on it.
I have had LOTS of Samsung phones and am always happy with them, but this one misses the mark a bit for me mainly due to battery life. Since purchasing I have done a few tweaks that were mentioned like going to dark mode and restarting more to make sure I am rebooting once in awhile (which is something I rarely had to do on my S10). I am hoping that makes a difference."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Boobs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed a new phone. First, I bought the Galaxy S22+. It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly. Plus, the outrageous price. So, I returned it. Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory. Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day I love this phone. Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back. But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day. And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe. Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me. And it was half the price of the S22+. This is a great alternative to the S22 series."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone charger not supplied with phone. Seems odd not to include an essential piece of equipment for the function of phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a Note 9 prior to this phone. I wish I would have just spent the money to get my Note 9 fixed rather than buying this one. Even though the S21 FE is mid-range and Note 9 is a higher tier, I thought since the S21 is newer it would be better, but it's not. The screen on the Note 9 is so much clearer and vibrant. The camera on the S21 does zoom in a lot, but it's so unclear that the zoom is pretty much useless. It's slower than I imagined it would be, too. The battery barely lasts a day. I usually have to charge it in the early evening. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My Zenfone 6 died on me. Out of all the phones, this was the only one to offer most of the features the Zenfone 6 did.

I needed a good battery, finger print scanner, expandable memory, snapdragon 8xx, 4k @60 video recording. This was the only one to offer these features.

The only two features I was worried about were the battery life and finger print scanner.

The battery life is great. Can easily get a day with moderate use and low screen brightness.

I was skeptical about the onscreen finger scanner. I couldn't verify beforehand if I needed to turn on the screen to use the scanner. Thankfully the scanner can be activated with the screen off. It's very accurate and fast.

The phone runs smooth. The cell signal is good. I use T-Mobile, and can get signal in most places.

The only thing I still don't like about all Samsung phones is their custom UI. Will never prefer it over stock Android.

Overall the phone is a great. Even now in mid 2022 there is no other better replacement for my Zenfone 6.

I recommend the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours, I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily. I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing. The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitely get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this White FE 25th March 2022 but started using some time in May and it took 3 months of using to realize that it is ACTUALLY DUAL SIM!!! All along I thought that the sim tray having SIM1 and SIM2 on the flip side was a generic design. It is odd because nothing on Amazon says dual sim but now checking GSM arena, it does indeed say dual sim stand-by.

The only draw back for me is the caller ID. It only shows the contact is the number is stored EXACTLY as it shows if the contact calls you! Very frustrating seeing contacts numbers I have stored display as a plain NOT saved first time caller."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone over a month ago to up grade from a S8. I live in Cape Coral Fl an as you know we just got hit by Ian which totally destroyed everything. This phone has been a god send. Got multiple calls in the eye of the storm and post storm. Id say sure its partially my carrier which is Metro PCS but I think it was also the phone or just a miracle. BUT I NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH MY FAMILY ONCE! thank you for making such a wonderful product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update)
After running the diagnosis, the local service center told me it was because the sim was not connecting to the network, which could be either due to faulty sim card, carrier software, or issue within the phone itself. I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.

---------
Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released. It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls. (Also can't return it, because I thought a software update would fix the problem and has been waiting and waiting, and 30 days has passed, issue still there)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update 7/20/22

I am still satisfied with my phone, in fact I have grown fonder of it. After using it for a few months I like its battery life better as it lasts me through the day.

The phone is highly customizable thru the ""Good Lock"" app.

The volume on the speakerphone has been useful a few times when I have taken while riding my bike with the phone on an armband.

I still highly recommend this phone, specially when there's a sale or refurbished one available. More bang for the buck!

-------

I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is fast and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].

The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.

The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.

I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.

To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.

The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)

I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions. I normally keep my phones until they give the ghost."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works well. It is a unlocked phone. My sim is not American based and I had no problems. GSM is one of the networks that is used, which the phone supports."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.
Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).
This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.
Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my new phone and the colors they come in are beautiful. I haven't used the face recognition yet but the finger print reader works pretty well, maybe a few times were it didn't work. Battery life has been getting me thru a day of work and then some as well, so good Battery life in my opinion. Love this phone definitely recommend👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is an upgrade from my $300 Motorola g6 that worked well for 3+ years but lacked the quality camera and some other features and was starting to become noticeably slower.

In upgrading my 3 highest priorities were hearing aid support, a better camera and faster processor for a price under $500.

I also considered the Pixel phones but chose this one for the cameras and price. All the better phones I looked at could stream directly to my Oticon More I hearing aids.

The face ID works as well as I expected as long as there is sufficient light. Why the phone doesn't produce more light when it needs it is a curiosity to me.

Like other phones I've had the fingerprint reader seems to require me to change how I apply my finger to the reader as time goes by.

The battery life is good and I only need to charge during the day if I am doing g a lot of Bluetooth broadcasting to my hearing aids.

Thy biggest annoyance at this point is I usually have to re-pair my hearing aids at least once a day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lots of storage very high tech"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had this phone for 18 months, its been dropped and never broke, battery still lasts all day and some when i watch alot of videos and games, cameras are great, size is perfect. Best phone for the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone far exceeded my expectations. The Android Play is great. I can play Pandora and Waze on my car stereo from this phone. I don't use the finger print or face recognition part but the battery lasts all day with plenty left over and i'm on it a lot..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.

That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.

In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.

I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is probably my fifth android from Samsung since switching from Blackberry. I formerly traveled a great deal and needed to be in contact. I was an early adapter but not a nerd. I choose Samsung over other manufacturers and have been very satisfied. iphone users always seem ready to put the Android down but I find the Samsung a much better price point. Each one seems to get a little better. Especially the camera optics. No exception with this one. My wife is now using my previous A50 model and is very satisfied. Previously all the Samsungs were the S series. I have never cracked a screen that I recall and that makes me believe they are sturdy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great features in this phone, especially for the price. There's always a catch, though, and in this case it's battery life. I upgraded from an older Samsung Android wanting 5G and better battery life. I got one of those. This one is slightly better than my 3 year phone related to battery life, but it's way more powerful. Can't have your cake and eat it too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had an 8s. This phone is about the same size and works basically the same. I have 2 complaints: it keeps showing pop ups, like multi media formating for at least a whole minute which prevents me from reading the text I received; difficult to assign individual notification sounds for each app (ie, I wanted a knocking sound for text messages only, but no matter what I do it knocks for other apps as well)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This a good phone with a good camera, battery life isn't the best. Notice it does not have a memory slot. You will only get the cable (C to C) and adapter is not included. Some cables (USB to C) do not work properly so I ended up buying the Samsung adapter C to C. Android Auto DOES NOT WORK on this phone, I had to buy an adapter for the car (usb to C) cables used with other phones didn't work. Adapter didn't recognize the Android Auto app either (I bought Samsung original cables), I have done everything but it just don't work on this phone. I have read that all Samsung S21 have reported the same issue. This is frustrating, Android Auto works fine with Pixel 6 and Xiaomi, so I'm considering changing the phone."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice. Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards. Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable. The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use. But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip. The screen is vibrant with deep colors & good contrast. Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video. I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone. There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google. I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.

Setup was a breeze. I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that! I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I don't use gave recognition. And my fingerprints are mostly burned away, so not using that either. Already mentioned battery life is questionable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9 for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.

The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.

For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.

I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!

Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.

When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon, please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone arrived without an adapter"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works fine. The battery, however, runs down quickly -even when I'm not using it. It was fully charged this morning and as it sat on my desk, unused, the battery dropped to 68%. As I write this, it dropped down to 66%. I'm not sure what goes into refurbishing a phone and whether they put in a new battery, so either this model sucks battery life or this is the old battery from the original phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The price was good for a damn good phone. I went with the S20 because it is the last to offer the mini SD card slot. Easy transfer of pictures and music. I had a S9 previously. This S20 is crazy fast, and the battery life is better than expected. All day and more.
Good price (half of the brand new S22) on the fence? Get off the fence and order it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is wonderful. Battery life is long, screen looks new and everything works as it should. Lots of storage, downloads fast and pictures turn out beautiful. Would buy again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ended up working ok. The phone we have is pretty but the case is ugly.
It does offer good protection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got to be honest I am not using the finger print feature since my hands are messed up, and didn't do the face recognition since I always wear a mask, but the phone is fine. It has a lot more storage than my other phone and the layout is perfect for me. Pictures and videos come out great as well. However, the battery on this is not great. Do not expect this phone to last for over a day evsn if you're just watching YouTube on it. If you need a phone to hold a charge for a long time I might not get this unless you got things to charge your phone with on stand by."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off, the battery is just OK, out of the box. With power saving settings I usually go 2 full days before charging. That's with a lot of bluetooth/earbud and internet usage. Satisfied with the battery.

Phone has some settings such as capping your CPU output at 70% which uses less battery life, as well as display and app settings you can modify for further battery saving. The phone is great in general. Very satisfied overall and would easily recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it's battery life and overall performance. Easy to use and great pictures!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G was an upgrade from an older Samsung. Perhaps, I expected improved battery life which is really something Samsung should work on. With minimal usage, I get about two days of life. The facial recognition works occasionally, but the fingerprint works fine, so no real problem. Everything else is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great graphics and good upgrade from my old S6. The battery is seriously the worst. This could have been a 5 star rating. I go from 100% to 85% within an hour. Disappointing, but it was Amazon Prime Day, so I got a good deal. I'll just have to keep it charged as often as I can. I'll definitely do more research before I upgrade again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice phone at a great deal on Prime Day. Been ready to upgrade to 5G for a while but didn't like the retail price. This model gives me the features I wanted in a size similar to the S9+ I currently use. Gave it 4 stars because Samsung ditched the micro SD slot which I liked because I don't like using the cloud for data or pics.
Your results and opinion may vary;)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought. I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus. That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues. I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone. Its screen is vibrant and colorful. Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning. I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well. Some complain about the selfie camera. At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled. Everything here far surpasses all my expectations. Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent. This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner. With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it. I never got half a day with my Motorola. I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage. This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time. Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it. Highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.

I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.

The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!

The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I thought having an expensive Samsung would be incredible but if we talk about how durable is the charge of the battery is way worse than cheaper Samsungs. Also, it overheat most of the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","just love the battery life. have not used the facial recognition. camera's are great too!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was a replacement for my.first S20 fe. I was a.little reckless and had the screen cover and case off and dropped it about 4 feet onto some cement. This phone has so many features and memory and is lightning fast! Battery
life could be better"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.
Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.
For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!
However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.
1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)
2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am a little disappointed on the battery life for this phone. It lasts most of the day, but does not have the life that I expected on this quality of phone. That is the only reason I did not give 5 stars. Otherwise, I am very happy with this phone. Definite upgrade over my previous Galaxy S10e."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone except camera is blurry when taking pictures of moving objects. My LG Stylo 4 took better pictures.. Sucks when you're trying to capture memories."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I checked in the Q&A section to make sure it came with a charger since the ""what's in the box"" just says TBA. People said it did but mine did not. Inconvenient and annoying. I am still mainly using my old phone (galaxy s8) until my case and screen protector arrive for this one and only have the 1 charger. No headphone jack, no dongle, no charger. They should at least supply you with what you need for general use.
Anyway I will probably update this to be more about the phone as I get some use out of it. So far impressions are that the battery is nothing to call home about even though it's a step up from my current one that drains in a few short hours of screen time. Which this new phone definitely lasts longer than that. Just not quite the amazing lasting quality I had noticed when I bought the s8. Absolutely runs smoother but gets equally hot as it's charging or in use. Definitely better camera than the s8. If it had the charger the rating would be at least a 4 star."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My only issue is us old schoolers like to get in box instructions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't used the facial or finger print security features so I can't comment on n those features. What I don't like at all is the amount of advertisements on this phone - it's annoying and not what I want at all but I refuse to pay a monthly fee to disable the ads. Won't buy another Samsung unless they ditch that feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first time ever purchasing a phone on Amazon. I was able to easily take this phone to Verizon and have them activate it. I've had the phone for almost a year now, and the only notable degradation I've observed is the battery life. I'm sure this happens inevitably with most phones, but it's still no slouch. I wanted the best bang for my buck on a good black Friday deal on my phone, and I definitely got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...

I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the item but the charger and charge cable were not included."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you want a solid phone with an SD card this is a great option. If you want to install titanium backup you are out of luck. There is currently no method for unlocking the boot loader for Android 12 -- One UI 4.0 -- so ... NO ROOT FOR YOU!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I feel like this product heats up. The screen feels super hot at times and sometimes I lose signal ,apps say network offline so I have to restart it to get it to work again"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy satisfecho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The description was not clear. I checked immediately i realised i had purchased an used phone. My fault is that i thought i was getting a new A series. Upon receipt i see its a S series and used. Came fast. Box was old. I just don't want a used phone. Nothing is wrong with it. Why i gave three stars i because thr description should be very clear its a used phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No it did not , it was advertised as a dual sim phone but operates as a
single sim phone as the phone can only recognize one sim in the slot that
was made to hold two , there is no sim card manager option in the settings
,other than that, it is a very good phone with excellent performance and
features, I have to now find cash to source another phone to house my
other sim card ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was supposed to be a factory unlocked US version. I am not sure it is? Having network issues. The phone is great though and I hope I can keep it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es muy interesante como sin darme cuenta la batería se descarga paso horas con el celular y me distraigo fácil duro hasta 5 horas usándolo leyendo o viendo videos y pues casi ni cargo el cel, me suelo despertar a la 3 pm y apenas a la 7 pm o 9 pm es que estoy volviendo a conectar el celular solo por que este tiene una carga de 36% o inferior"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Si lo que buscas es una camara es muy bueno! Ahora si lo que buscas es un teléfono es mejor que lo compres en una tienda reconocida, por aquí es imposible encontrar algo que funcione bien!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my phone - had a Samsung 7 forever (I don't like change). It was so easy to transition to S21 - has all of the former features I loved so much and so many more. No learning curve at all to use it and lots more functionality. Really great sound quality - for calls, music and media. I will probably hold on to this one for the next 7 years. :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is ""just ok""! I had to have it replaced by Samsung after the return period ended as the wifi receiver crapped out and the phone couldn't maintain a connection. Amazon would do NOTHING, and Samsung took my NEW phone back and repaired it but I had NO PHONE for a full week!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really super nice phone. The camera quality is simply outstanding and the screen is fantastic too. It's fast enough even in the 6GB ram version. Battery life could be a bit better but power-saving mode does help without detracting from the experience. I wish they'd throw in a dual charging and headphone dongle though. Miss my headphone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off this phone is not from manufacturer. I tried to get accident insurance from Samsung and when I enter the EMEI. It tells me that they don't insure phones from other country's. And 2nd it did not come with an S-Pen. This phone does have some issues although it's 6 ram and 256 mg it's slow . Pictures aren't good. I did have the note 10 plus before this phone and I would say it's like night and day no comparison. Never any issues with my note 10 plus."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No me llego el cargador del celular, con quien puedo hablar"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery went through 3 days without power during hurricane Ian."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely better than my old A50! I am disappointed with the battery life. Also it updates so frequently."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Transferred all files easily from old to new. Easy to get accustomed to especially if you currently have a samsung or android. SD card slot is with sim card slot - easy to install. No fear of breaking a thousand dollar plus phone;-)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall, I like the phone. It's fast, stable, and feature packed. I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me). I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.

If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone. Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case). This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass. While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.

Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buen equipo tiene buena cámara"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Returned. Bought it thinking that it would surpass the 500 dollar TCL I bought in March. That phone is now 340.00 which is closer to the correct price. Didn't take long for the Samsung to start freezing and become slow to respond. So now I have two phones that kinda suck for a total of 1k. One can't be returned and with price drop means I'd be lucky to get a hundred bucks in resale. So returned this one and will live with flaws of the TCL. Maybe I'm expecting too much for the price. 300 bucks should get a decent phone. So for 200 more than I want to spend freezing and glitches this early is not good news. Haven't tried iphone yet. I really don't need a great camera with a million pixels and 4 different lenses. I have a dslr for photos. Will run this TCL in the ground for the next year."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone a year ago. The camera on this phone is really great. Clear, sharp pictures. I do like the features of the phone. After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Phone is amazing, I have had this for a while now and I'm loving it soo much, Quality is Amazing, Performance is Amazing as well as Battery is Long lasting, I love the phone soo much I would buy another one if I could lol, I definitely recommend this phone to any persons looking for a Cheaper High-Quality phone :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received the S20 FE today. Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot. Overall its been a good first day with the phone.

I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.

Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing. Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.

Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display. I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.

My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM. That was a selling point for me. When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the least expensive place I found this phone. Although Cricket offered it on their website, for some reason every payment type I tried (3) was rejected and the order cancelled. The local stores couldn't get it, and didn't know when it would be available. They suggested Best Buy or Samsung.com, but both of those were $150 more. Amazon to the rescue!! In stock AND it was PRIME DAY!! I got it for less than I could anywhere else! Love the phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am not having any problems with this 20 fe g5 phone. It works good. Put the att SIM in and was receiving texts and making calls without issue. I like the no wire charging, the easy backup of contacts and apps. it was very nice to have the SIM card removal stick in the box.
It was also easy to put the micro memory in on the other side of the service providers SIM, SIM on one side flip little tray over and memory goes there, I watched a YouTube video on where memory went. I know people need to lock their phones but I don't like to and I like that it allow that as an opt out. Mostly I hate Bixby and although Bixby still takes up space it isn't a button on the phone. Bixby is the worst thing about Samsung phones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.
I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!
I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.
Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a long time, I had a Samsung A31 which worked really good until I realized that my time for updates was running out and I wanted android 13 and up. So I did research and bought this phone, works with straight talk well. Definitely recommend."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Edit/update-Had to return this.

Reception was terrible but improved slightly after disabling the 5g radio. The Xperia I replaced this with has not had this issue or any of the following ones

This phone did not like wifi6, only 2.4ghz played nicely

This thing did not emby at all. Video was all black blocks that kinda faded out wherever the movement was but very odd looking. It would also take a very long to load anything and often had a/v sync issues. My current phone does not have this issue nor did the v35, z4 play. Or essential phone I used over the last 2 years.

The camera really does overprocess images but most people might be good with it.

Forget about unlocking the bootloader. It'll work for the enxyos version but nothing yet with the snapdragons.

It feels like everythingfrom Samsung requires another agreement even a camera mode. The amount of bloatware is crazy too.

""TouchWiz"" needs to go away

I would strongly recommend looking at other phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had an old S8 that was cracked to heel due to my 2 year old. Everything is SO much quicker now. Pop back and forth between apps instantly. My Twitter and reddit feeds scroll so smoothly, and the 5g is faster than my fiber connection at home. It's a little too big for my liking, but I'll get used to it. I like the button layout on my S8 better, but I'll get used to that as well. The finger print reader for me is instant and perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Vengo de un samsung j7 (2016) y tener este celular es tan bello, es un gran cambio me agrada tanto, me encanta que venga desbloqueado de fábrica, soy de Honduras tengo Red Tigo y me funcionó al 100% desde la primera vez que le puse el chip, no me toco andar activando el celular y gastando de más, el reconocimiento facial no lo he probado, el lector de huella siento que le cuesta siempre tengo que poner mi dedito mínimo dos veces porque no lo reconoce, creo que se descarga un poco rápido, esta en 100% me pongo a jugar un ratito y ya lo tengo en 97 y un juego que no es taan difícil (Beach buggy) , aveces siento que se caliente por la parte de arriba al lado de la cámara por creo que es porque paso pegada en el cel todo el día y la temperatura ambiental acá no ayuda, cuando lo pongo a cargar carga rápido en aproximadamente 1 hora y 10 o 30 mints., la cámara trasera es sensacional me encanta su modo de noche es muy nitida, la cámara delantera no me dejo muy feliz si no estas en buenas condiciones de luz se verá rara la foto, el video en 4k está asombroso, tiene buenas funciones el celular, la verdad lo recomiendo un montón el color es bello. En su caja solo venía el celular, el cargador y algunos papeles. Si estas interesado en este celular compralo, es una buena elección, no te arrepentirás."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When my old Samsung S9 stopped working without warning ( network ) I started looking for a phone. With the supply shortages around the world this was not as easy as it should have been. I checked retailers and service providers. It seemed that they only had black phones available if any. Did not want a black phone. I also could not afford the latest, best models. The S21 had all the latest software and features with a beautiful display. Data transfer from my old phone was very easy. New phone is fast. Of all the features that I was concerned about was the speaker. As a senior with less than perfect hearing I was very pleased with the volume. I could hear the phone clearly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.

FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.

Pros
- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.
- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.
- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.
- Camera is amazing. 3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.
- I love the colors. I got the Orange.
- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.
- Larger screen and battery than the S20
- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner
- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.
- Comes with a charger. APPLE!

Cons
- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.
- No 3mm headphone jack
- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.

In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.

Auto focus:
The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.
A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.
This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.
The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focus

Finger Print Sensor:
It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.
Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.
Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.

Using the Camera kills other apps:
I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.

Note: Moved to this phone from the S9"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","an upgrade from my faithful S10e. A bit bigger but no so much heavier.
works fast, good camera and great screen. I think the battery life could be improved, is not as long lasting as I expected.
But great features for a good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G it's a great device so far I got the 256GB model with 8GB of RAM and by comparing it to my current S20 FE side by side with the S21 FE the S21 FE is a little shorter and the S20 FE is a little taller but the one thing I don't like about the S21 FE is the back plastic when touching it with your finger it feel like one of those plastic tray that you get from the fast food restaurant and if you are planning to buy the S21 FE don't forget to purchase a skin wrap from sopiguard or dbrand and you might want to put a case on but I'm going to give the S21 FE 5 Star anyway it's a premium device with cheaper plastic back cover like a fast food to go plastic tray so far it's a really great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery doesn't last long.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it's a great phone with good camera and battery life. and you don't have to wait for always on display until ip14 comes out"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The face recognition and the fingerpint is okay. Sometimes the fingerprint can't recognice your finger, but I think it is fine. However, the battery life is a main problem for me. The battery life really drains down a lot when I am on this phone. The previous phone I have will last the whole day, but this samsung phone will only last me three hours. I also have a problem with using the camera for this phone. At first everything was great, but after a while, when I open my phone, it will vibrate for no reason. I have tried to find the cause but there is nothing. Also when i use the camera it will lag and log me in to other apps. When i use snapchat, it will keep on vibrating nonstop. Don't get this please! It is not worth 500$!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.

I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked. My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully. I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.

But I'm amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem. I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.

Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps. I don't want bloatware, but as I became familiar with Samsung apps they work flawlessly with their products.

The other thing is the camera on this Samsung is outstanding and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Samsung has hooked me.

The phone also works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy watches.

Excellent customer service and support."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because I needed to. My old phone had a cracked screen and it had started to glitch. So I choose this one.
This phone is exactly as described. Battery is ok; won't last more than a day. I don't use my phone for many things so it's a good option for my everyday life."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After two months use the only problem I have is the lack of a slot for expandable memory. The video is clean and crisp and the speaker is good enough that I can hear it even with my bad hearing. The camera works well and takes nice photos. Would I buy it again? No because by the time I need a new phone this will be obsolete."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love everything about this phone (128 gb, 6gb ram, Snapdragon chip version) It's looks, specs, camera, call quality, performance, all the usual stuff. At $499 it's a bargain at the price point simply because of the Oct 2020 release date.

One issue for me is I use it for personal and work. I think this causes a Play Store App install issue (not sure if it's Android or Samsung bug). At first it seems unfixable. But in my case removing the Sim card and SD card ND then a reboot fixed it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about the device is as you would expect (pretty great) except for one thing...it's bent.
Not a big bend mind you, but a very very slight one that even the technician I ended up bringing it to did not see it at first. One area of the screenlooked a little off to me but I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and pushed through. I noticed the bend( which slightly warped part of the screen) about a week in but ignored it because it could only be seen under certain conditions and because i believed it to be harmless. However within a few weeks I noticed that the touch detection when I'm typing often messes up, especially when I'm using swipe. Not only that but after applying a screen protector the issue becomes very obvious as it's never able to properly adhere to the warped area of the screen. I contacted Amazon about the problem and was told there was nothing that could be done because my complaint was outside their ""satisfactory window"". Now I'm left with a device with a factory defect that I have to pay out of pocket to fix. Now I understand why my friends refuse to buy certain tech items from Amazon.
Other aspects of the phone are pretty great safe for the fingerprint reader which is a bit hit or miss but I'm not sure if it's meant to be that way or just a result of the aforementioned bend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love this camera, I upgraded from an S5, quite a change. So far, the only dislike is the size of my photos. My photos are around 7 meg, humongous! I am burning up a lot of space on my storage devices.
Its nice to have that quality when needed, but not for everyday photos. It is a pain to change the resolution of each photo after the shot. I am looking to see if maybe there is a better camera app to allow this setting, this is my first camera to not have this setting. I hope enough people complain so Samsung will return this feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Used daily for everything a cell phone is supposed to do, but this one feels and acts like it won't have the durability of a Galaxy. So spend the extra money and get the better version. You'll thank me later."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is exactly what I was looking for. The S22 has not great reviews so I defaulted to this for my son & he loves it. It's bigger than regular size phone, came in factory sealed box brand new with everything we needed. Battery lasts all day, fingerprint reader without issue. Reliable & sturdy, hope it lasts as long as his last phone (S10e)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The S21FE delivers the speed I need and reliability I love. The only problem I ran into was the texting app. It was not working with most texting applications. I did not want to hard restart the phone and do a factory reset. I had just set up everything. I searched and found textra working beautifully, so I will just paid for that texting app—no other issues. I'm happy with the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone arrived in pristine condition. Setup was extremely simple -- I simply removed the SIM card from the older broken phone and placed the card in the new phone. After about 10-15 minutes of configuration / downloading updates, I had a working phone that was much faster and more advanced than my older broken phone.

The one downside is that I did a speed test on Verizon's 5G network and noticed speeds were no where near where they claimed 5G would be at this point. However, this is a carrier issue and not a phone issue so I didn't knock the review based on something outside the control of the seller.

All in all, a great transaction and one that I wouldn't hesitate to do again in the future!

- J"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I already own one but brother wanted to purchase S21FE but discovered S21FE did not include removable SD card so returned phone and purchased this one. It was brand new in sealed box AND included both charger and cable, which Samsung not leaves out for $600-$1000 you would think they can spare a couple bucks for charger and cable. Phone activated fine with Verizon and everything seems great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In 2022 it's very difficult to buy a new phone with microSD support. I bought this S20 FE to replace my S9+. It was easy to transfer all my apps and data to the new phone.

Unfortunately Samsung deliberately limits the performance of external SD cards to encourage people to buy phones with larger internal storage. My SDXC card can do 91MB/s read and 59MB/s write on my laptop's card reader, but only 74MB/s read and 38MB/s write on S20 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery lasts long time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.

The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.

This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.

Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.

One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good replacement for my old s8 plus.

Had it about 10 months now and phone is still ok. But it is a little glitchy. The screen will either not want to scroll, or will jump around or select things without me even touching the screen. Doesn't do it a lot but shouldn't do it at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well, but your first month will be spent on the internet trying to find hidden setup options."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone to replace my one plus 7t phone that did not have WiFi calling.It lives up to Samsung quality and performance."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.

Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone. I would highly recommend this phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had to buy a new phone. Went from s10 to this. Hate the removal of headphone jack but what can you do. Color looks more blue than mint green but that might just be me. Either way it's in a case so I don't really care. Came new in box and works perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this because I didn't want the giant Samsung Galaxy S21 ultra super mega or whatever it's called. DOES NOT HAVE AN SD CARD SLOT. You will need to free up 84 hours of your life to transfer everything over to your new phone, wirelessly. One. File. At. A. Time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Transferred over about 2 weeks ago and I was excited to have this much storage vs what I previously had. I always keep my screen dimmed when using and turn off all apps from running in the background but literally watched the battery drain from 93% to 61% in about 2 minutes! It's super disappointing for the amount of money spent on it, especially when I found the same model and make elsewhere for $100 less, only 2 days after it arrived."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good budget phone. It has all the up to date specs as most other phones do. The face and finger print reader work well. It works with most 5G networks. No lag or battery drainage for a new phone. Camera has a lot of options. Only complaint is, after a I bought the phone the price went down almost $50 30 days later. Of course, after the return date. I really hate when Amazon does that. Other then that, it works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was delivered on time, took it to Tmobile setup took 5 minutes. Very happy with this purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's an average phone. Nothing like a flagship, battery 🔋 life is terrible and the phone gets hot often.
It has smooth scrolling and decent storage. The camera is average. Not good at all, my a51 5g took better pics and had much better charging and battery life.
S20 fe is a better phone and I truly regret spending money on this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Has a great camera. Very clear screen. Battery life excellent. Glad we bought it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am on a prepaid plan with Verizon. Had no problem with service. Phone came with Smart Switch. I am not super tech smart but even I could follow the simple directions which transferred everything to the new phone. Text messages ,photos ,contacts and apps. Beautiful phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Great service. Great seller. Arrived in the original box. New and factory sealed. Love the phone and Samsung. Big improvement over my old S7. Tried others and this is the one for me. Don't hesitate to buy one. The price and features are just right."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good phone except for bixby"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back.
The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly.
Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).
Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)
For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.
Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the s21fe g5 and liked it so much, I ordered a second one for my wife. WARNING: My wife clicked on the green option so our phone would be different.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your a someone who uses your phone all day and hate charging your your phone,i dont recommend buying it. I bought this phone brand new and the battery life is really bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything about this phone. After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to buy the phone. But after some thought I purchased it and haven't had a problem with it at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works great! First time with an S phone and I am not disappointed by any means. I was also able to transfer my number and services without much issue.

Very happy, would recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.
There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.
I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.

My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.

A little common sense would be great.
It's an expensive electronic device. This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.

I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.

GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.
There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.

I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took a picture of my puppy and as you can see, it takes good photos. I upgraded from a Samsung galaxy s7 so it's a major upgrade for me. I'm a 66 year old woman and it was easy to move all my stuff from my old phone to the new one. So far I love this phone and the battery lasts all day into the evening. Very happy 😊"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really like this phone. Upgraded from the Samsung A50. The S 21FE 5 G is just a hair bigger, but is actually lighter and packs a whole lot of features into its size. Got the model with the 128 MB and it works amazing. The camera is great, sharp and clear and battery life is easily all day even using it a lot. It has facial recognition and a finger print reader which is much better than the A 50. The only down side it will not run an app that we specifically got the phones for, the DEXCOM 6G app to read blood sugars. I think the app hasn't been updated for the newest phones.
Over all very pleased with the phones and the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for loyal Samsung Galaxy users but other flagship phones around the same price range have better features. I owned an S8 for years and noticed this phone did not improve battery life as much as it should after 4 generations. But still great overall phone for standard users like me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was finally time to move up from my Galaxy S7, Lol...it still worked pretty good, but was so slow. Bought my new S21 on Prime Day and got a great deal! So far, very happy with the phone. Larger screen, good battery life and super fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fingerprint scanner works, but only when I get my thumb just right, and it wasn't picking up any better in the training session. Methods to open menus or swipe away windows tend to overlap in applications and for the phone notifications...etc. resulting in a lot of wrong windows opened or swiped away."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed an upgrade and I have never spent more than $200 on a phone before. Thought I would treat myself. Jokes on me. Battery life sucks and this brand new, unlocked phone is in a constant loop of updates and reboot. Never again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my new Samsung galaxy s21 bc I'm a simple man. I have simple needs and also bc I had my s9 plus for like 3 and half years. Great upgrade for the price couldn't find a better price anywhere just make sure you know who your carrier is and have a current Sim card to switch it over. Battery life is great authenticity is perfect. If you're an android person get this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was alarmed when I got this phone because the included cable plugged into the phone at both ends of the cord. Two small plug-ins. I don't have any adapters that would fit that it make this work as a usb connection. What I realized later is that my old Samsung charging cord works with it, and that has a usb adaptor that can work in my car. The included cable is actually supposed to be used to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone!! How about that? I didn't use that, but used the QR code the new phone gave me and the bluetooth connection and easily transferred all my data, even before I have gotten a sim card for it. Bravo, Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I can't downplay the reviews from other users because their opinions and needs are different than mine. I almost did not purchase because of certain reviews but I'm glad I did because so far this phone has been amazing. I came from a Moto G5s plus and I can see a big difference already, in a good way. There are a few features I will have to get used to, but I can adapt. The only downside so far is only having 3 fingerprints to use to unlock your phone, but that's minor. I definitely recommend. In my opinion, you won't be disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone and it came right on time. It is so easy to use and I don't have to fight with the screen like my last phone to type and correct things. It takes amazing pics and the battery is very good. I have nothing bad to say about it. Loving the sage green too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is great and I had no problems with it. However, for some reason it's not on Samsungs trade in list. So if you want to upgrade, u may want to steer clear of buying this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far. So easy to set up and transfer all my info from my S9 and did it all wirelessly. Paired up everything for Bluetooth as well. Not glitchy and colors on screen are so clear and bright. The price was definitely right and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is great! Needed a new phone and the carriers make it imposable to change. I guess that the phone number is what they want. Buy the phone and get your provider and save money."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always been a Samsung guy, but my last phone was a MOTO Z3 Play. It was nice, but weak camera and battery was getting bad at 30 months, phone also acting buggy even after factory reset... This S20 FE blows the MOTO away. It really is the perfect screen size! Not too big! WOW the 5G is incredible!!!!!! Camera is great and I'm demanding... 120Hz is just the best, do not downplay this, it's smooth as butter.... love the screen print scanner, it's flawless no matter what people say, just keep re-entering same thumb as finger one, two and three, it reall is flawlewss if you do that... AMOLED screen is just BEAUTIFUL! Gorrilla Galss 3 is a must... battery life is great, I'm on it a lot and still 40-50% by end of day... supplied charger is plenty fast enough... menu is bloated and complicated, but manageable... LOVE the stereo speakers! Just an all around great experience... no need to get the S20. Great price here... sold by and shipped by Amazon, what more do you want??"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What bothers me the most is that the cord sent was not the one for this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. All of the reviewers' complaints about facial recognition and fingerprint access do not apply to me, because I do not use them. The transition from my old Motorola phone and my S21 FE I did myself with only a few problems. The screen is sharp, the size is comfortable and my applications run smoothly. The only app I have had trouble with is the Contacts app (Samsung), which will not let me edit Contacts. This problem is endemic in the S20s and S21s. I downloaded a Google app for contacts and had no more trouble."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size, high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware, Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.

This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I'm very happy with mine and I think you will be too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good 5G phone for the price. Heavier than expected...got a Otter cover and screen protector. Camera didn't work at first but Amazon Customer Service helped get it working."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great no problems does what it says. Battery drains faster then expected"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This size is perfect. Fast processing. On screen finger print recognition great. I miss not having an led showing battery charger status and flashing led when I missed a call. Screen shots are no longer power & vol buttons but swiped palm across screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm completely satisfied.
Unlocked version worked great.
Very fast phone !
But one thing I thought it was supposed to come with a sim card/cards mine came with none"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's OK, nothing revolutionary"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After some research, I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I've learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The two reviews below are from the first two times I attempted to purchase and use this phone. Third time was the charm. The Bluetooth works fine, and I'm loving this phone!

----------------

The phone is very attractive, the sound quality is good, and the screen is large and the picture clear. But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)

I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer. But really, at these prices, should I have to do research to make it do something it's supposed to do anyway? I really wanted to love this phone, but it is useless to me unless the Bluetooth works with my car."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La única queja que tengo hasta ahora es que la batería no dura nada . Me dura 6 horas y yo siempre he tenido Samsung y Siempre duran mucho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera on this phone is phenomenal it will go to 30x zoom but it is only clear up to 25x, which is still way more than i'll ever need. Overall the phone is really nice, long battery life and far more storage than i'll ever need."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is unlocked but some services will have problems adding it and will insist it's already been attached to a carrier. Fingerprint reader isn't great with glass screen protector and for some reason all glass screen protectors come with a hole for the front facing camera so fuzz builds up making the image quality poor.

I have no qualms with the phone itself though. Works great, it's fast. Restarts amazingly fast. Great photo quality even with the fe version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall happy with the phone. Few little quirks, camera wants to go to portrait mode instead of landscape when trying to deposit checks. Battery is good, not great.
For the price it's a solid choice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung took away SD card slot. So no memory expansion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was my first time buying a phone online but I took the chance and am happy I did. Phone works perfectly, setup was easy and the package, phone and accessories was in good condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life of the phone I got is terrible! I'm going to have to have a new battery put in it already! Never had this issue with any other phone until this one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took like a day getting use to the finger print being at the front of the screen rather than the back of the phone(old phone). Nothing wrong with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So let's start with the screen. It's beautiful, responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.

Next up is signal. I live in a rural area so service is tricky, but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions, inside a manufacturing plant for example.

Camera is on the list too, don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera. It's not the best camera out the, but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.

The battery is impressive. I'm kinda hard on my phone battery, and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time. You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.

P.S. That Snapdragon is a monster."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is brand new very very happy Thank-you 😊"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super crisp display, great sound, fast, wireless charging, easy set up, so many features. This is a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quality phone for the price. Only downfall is there is no slot for additional memory."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT! It is totally worth the money and you won't be disappointed!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","AT&T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&T network. They didn't have any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsung online and it also advertised the dual sim US functionality. Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&T's verifying this was a Dual sim capable product. After receiving it, I used AT&T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferring everything - apps, passwords, pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidence that it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean. They don't release the software for dual sims in the U.S. (because carriers don't want it I've learned), BUT they said that they will release the feature update ""soon."" When is soon? ""Soon.""

If Samsung and the distributor advertisements here on Amazon wouldn't have misrepresented this phone, i wouldn't have purchased it. They want me to send back a device for a refund, now, that has all my personal and business info loaded on it with no option for me to have a working device.

Let this be a warning for those who don't read sub threads of sub threads about tech, and just believe the manufacturer (Samsung), carrier (AT&T), and distributor (Amazon) won't openly misrepresent and lie to rob you.

The battery on this is relatively weak, the memory is comparatively weak, and IT'S NOT DUAL SIM FUNCTIONAL."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cost saving (or false claim of earth saving) measures means no charger in the box with the phone. The old Samsung charger I had is not a fast charger. The one OEM (?) I bought on Amazon caused the phone to overheat. Has wireless charging, so yay!?
Has no audio jack. one can waste money on USB-C headphones or fancy bluetooth set.
All the nasty features I hated in any iPhone, Samsung has copied. Thank God we get to use USB. ;)
Fingerprint biometrics is a tricky thing. If you use some screen-protectors it plain refuses to detect your fingerprint. It also thinks my face changes 5 times a day, by complaining ""face not recognized"".
Camera is good as usual. Not a fan of Samsung apps, till somebody convinces me. A decent phone for its price, especially if you insist on avoiding Chinese makers xaomi, honor etc. But don't expect a miracle."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Appears to be a good phone so far speedy and doesn't appear to have any issues so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me, the battery not holding anything like a proper charge. I looked at several models/brands in a modest price range (that were also available) and since this was actually available and also since the faster CPUs seem to universally overheat (and I don't tend to play games) this seemed like a good phone to try. The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.

The best part by far though are the speakers, far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I've owned. I like to listen to YouTube while I walk my dog, don't really want headphones and this is a fantastic improvement."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The quality of photo from s21 FE we can compare with Iphone 13 pro. Sometimes Samsung better"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered the phone and it didn't come with a charger cord, just the phone. I haven't charged or used it, yet. I recently decided to use the charger I already had, but it doesn't charge as fast. The phone freezes during app downloads, at times. I have to push button on the side of the phone for it to light up, before using it. The battery life is just ok. Overall, I like the phone and maybe this one just has glitches, idk. Probably exchange or return it. I welcome any suggestions of a nice operating/functioning affordable phone. To add, I had to replace 1st phone due to glitches. The newer phone has glitches, also, such as echoing and static, times. Called Amazon before the 90 days expire and they referred me to Samsung. Both, stating it's my cell phone company. Cell phone company tested it and states it's probably the phone. To add, the screen goes black when searching the web, now, July 2022. I've only had it for almost 3 months. Amazon will not help due to 30 day return policy, being expired. Lesson, for me, next time buy from a reputable cell phone company such as Verizon, T Mobile, etc. or maybe even Best Buy. I've lost over $600 buying this phone from Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Original product. Everything works as it should"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone S21 FE works perfectly with no bugs at all so far for 3 days. Camera is good but not excellent in low light condition. Battery drains fast with 120hz display. The phone is very fast and all apps runs without any issue. Phone call or internet connectivity works well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I used samsung phones all my life, infact my first smartphone was of samsung with google logo at its back. And this is my first S series samsung phone and I loved it! I always had issues with the phone speed, but this one's pretty great and with 256 GB of the memory with factory unlocked, the price is great! All in all totally worth the buy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like my new galaxy s21, big upgrade for me from the s7. Very smooth transition. All I had to do was swap sim cards. I have at&t."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I chose this phone after using my GS8 beyond its service life. I only buy a new phone every few years when. I've owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery, good screen, good camera, fast charging, 4k video, good audio, good looks, multiple colors, SD card support, wireless charging, wireless power sharing, facial unlock, etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's capable of doing most anything toy expect from a smartphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using it for a couple of month. I am not a gamer and I just use the phone for daily calling and sometimes for video conferencing. Haven't experienced any lag for the normal phone usage yet. Since I am not a heavy user, battery stays charged for more than a day. Nice screen resolution. Camera is pretty good too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have tried cheap Android phones and they all have issues. I then tried iphone and the Uber app causes overheating and dimming issues. I have had this phone for a month and it works great so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to do a factory reset to get the GPS working, but now it's okay! 4 stars because it was very confusing and no one in Samsung/Amazon/UbrrakIfix could not find the fix after few days until I did a factory reset on my own."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the larger memory version of this phone (256 gb), plus the ability to store videos on the removable memory chip. I volunteer for a concert organization and often record shows. So far, so good.
This phone doesn't support the Verizon UW 5G - but it does support the lower band 5G. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the services that use Verizon cell service do not support this phone - I'm stuck with Verizon (luckily , Verizon knocked off $10 per line for autopay). It's kinda strange, since at least one of the services support this phone.

Otherwise, the phone price and features are sweet for an unlocked device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice. The phone is beautiful well designed, is a small computer it connects to my PC and when I'm working I can receive and send messages from the PC., never mind the iPhone, this Samsung is great, if you have a choice buy it you will not regret it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for quite a while now, and am absolutely loving it. I've been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage), games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour), absolutely NO stuttering, and the camera is pretty good too.

Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.
Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off, you wont get that here.
Camera. There is 30x, but no 100x, zoom (not a big deal for me, but that might matter for you) And it probably isn't QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.
No pen. The s-pen can be very useful, but you wont get it here.
There are a few other small things, but this is all the big things I've noticed.
CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!
THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!

If none of these things are deal breakers, GO BUY THIS PHONE! ITS AMAZING!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy buen equipo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I wish Samsung had an easy way to get rid of the bloatware. I'm paying for the phone outright and I feel I'm being ripped off with horrible software. The battery is at 20 percent at the end of the day with moderate usage. Just beautiful and powerful hardware, botched by horrendous software. I wish I could just flash a clean AOSP rom on this, I'm going to try when some tools are available (if they are in the future). I would not mind paying 50 bucks more for the same phone running the pixel like Android."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone feels great in the hand. Screen is clean and clear. Battery life is atrocious, just bad, terrible. At this price point, buy a Pixel 5a, 4a, 6a, anything but this. Or step up to the S21+ or Ultra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing 'Budget' about the price on this phone and yet they still found a way to justify REMOVING high use features that have been available to their 'faithful' users for YEARS on previous models. This will not be my last phone but it will be my LAST SAMSUNG!

If you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone numbers like 'Freebird' to the ex's number, 'Show me the Money' to your Accountant, and some Barry White to the new significant other then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you like to use a voicemail app that stores your phone messages on your phone so that you can in two swipes see and delete message and don't have to hit four buttons to call out to a 8** number just to hear/delete/save a message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you prefer to 'one swipe/delete' text messages from the Messaging App and do not want to be FORCED to use yet FOUR more screen touches to open the text/menu/delete/trash buttons just to delete a text message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

If you want to feel 100% assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging has been fiddled with where you have the 'Navy' version that the Manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of a 'Mint' cover to match the designation on a box label then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!

However,

If you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub-menus then GET THIS PHONE!

If you like your phone FULL of Google and Samsung Apps that you CANNOT remove OR Disable and that will constantly be up your, er in your face on a phone that you will pay high dollar for then GET THIS PHONE!

If you want to save $100.00 from the Carriers for this model and save the extra $200.00 it would take to get a phone with real features then GET THIS PHONE!

I 'Used' to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tones associated with friends and family. Thanks Samsung/Sprint for providing a substandard product with the release of the S20 FE 5G."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen. Even with the ""block accidental touches"" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.

The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.

The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me. Same for the google pestware. But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.

Still, listening to music is a blessing! My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit. But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Completely unimpressed with this phone, and I'm coming from a 4 year old galaxy a50. The 5g occasionally pulls in some impressive numbers but it will still buffer movies or videos while supposedly having full signal. But the best part is when it just completely refuses to open anything. Bought a phone for me and my wife and we both experienced this. Pull out your phone and try to call someone...no connection. No internet. But shows full 5g signal. Speedtest shows almost zero data moving if I can even get it to connect, even if I'm on a working wifi. I had the phone for less than a month and experienced this about 5 or 6 times. We are returning both of them. Battery life was ok. Touchscreen is pretty lousy for a new phone, as was face recognition. Camera and Space zoom were the only thing impressive to me. Otherwise it didn't seem to do anything my old budget phone couldn't do"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","PRICE, SIZE, FUNCTION..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is disappointing. It loses 10% just sitting overnight. I may return the phone unless I can figure out what is draining the battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty good phone. I'm still kind of disappointed by the quality of the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After owning this phone for 2 months I'm back being a Samsung fan. My last was the S4 and the 2014 note 10.4, I felt abandoned when Samsung didn't update. Just updated to Android 11 and I commend Samsung for keeping their word on supporting this phone.

Battery life is good with heavy usage over 24 to 36 hour period. Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response, but you'll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here, I will say that I'm only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings. If you have a smart things hub you'll love the user experience with the app. My Galaxy Buds+ and Active 2 watch also have a great interface and user experience."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from an S10E and this is exactly what I was looking for. I've only had it a few days so I'm still playing w/the options. I haven't set up the Face recognition but the fingerprint reader works great. I am very pleased with this purchase, the cost was cheaper and very pleased with the phone itself. Thank you!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El único contra que podría decir es la batería, hay que saber administrarla en el día a día.
Lo demás todo increíble."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue. I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..

Now for the showstopper. The touch hardware is complete and utter trash. The October firmware update helped a bit. The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid. If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so. I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear. Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.

This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work. Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.

I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."". Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung. A screen. That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer. And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.

This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue. Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue. Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup. 100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to. The camera is decent enough and it behaves like flagship without the price. It certainly outperforms my Samsung a71 which simply gave up on life after a year. That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.

Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either... I can't tell the difference between 4g and 5g, but that could be my provider and not the phone.

In short, decent phone, good specs, battery makes this phone not perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fácil al tacto y la bateria durable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfecto dispositivo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I give the phone four and half stars for fast speedy performance, great cameras, fast battery charging, great price, and excellent expandable MicroSD card storage capacity up to 1TB. The only thing I like to see improved is the amount of RAM. The smartphone comes with 6GB of RAM. I already have 3GB of RAM used. Like to see at least 8GM of RAM. I also like the fact the phone is unlocked. You can take the smartphone to the carrier of your choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like the amount of storage this phone has, but 4 months in and it's been having issues with replaying the motion capture video for pictures. Using double-tap to light up the screen when it's off works probably 70% of the time. Swipe is terrible. I have a tempered glass screen protector on it but I have never had a phone be so bad at swipe with one on. I will try to swipe a word and end up with something completely random or it doesn't recognize the word I obviously swiped (e.g. ""adhesive"" instead of ""aggressive""). My Samsung S7 was better at recognizing than this one. Another issue with swipe is that it'll stop tracking and give you a bunch of jumbled things all broken up like ""ch a game"".

I've also had issues with certain apps, only with this phone. I am only 4 months into having this phone and I'm starting to regret my purchase. Unless it starts improving, I'm not sure I feel great about having this -- nor expecting it to last -- the next few years or so."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First time buying a phone that wasn't directly from a carrier before and I was not disappointed. I did run into issues but that was more of my carrier's fault than the actual product. I purposely chose this phone so I can insert a microSD since the new phones today no longer have the slot.

I am very happy with my new phone! Easy to set up, I was able to transfer all of my data from my old phone, and I was able to use it that very same day."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.

The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.

Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.

I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Going from an s10 to this was a downgrade. This phone is pretty leggy with load times and doesn't have expandable memory. It feels cheap and the cameras are sub par next to the older galaxy. I expected a decent phone out of the s21 fe and got a cheap budget phone that is rather slow. Wish I got a normal s21 :(

Additionally, I've had this phone for 4 months and it has the worst battery life. Cleared all usage and the battery just drains like I'm using the entire processor constantly.

This phone went from sort of junky to absolute trash."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Does all I need and does it well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The speaker volume goes up and down. Sound goes in and out.Have to use earphones to have consistency. Otherwise phone is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I change my 3 year old phone for this one. Ilike how fast it is and it has a lot of space. Battery is not so good but I use it a lot to play. It charges pretty fast if you have the right cable so that compensates for battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buying a new phone online was a little sketchy but with Amazon's easy return policy I went for it, bought my unlocked s21 fe it showed up in 1 day, I put my Sim card in downloaded an app to switch all my stuff over and done brand new phone hooked up to Verizon without ever going to the store will buy my next phone from Amazon as well"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had Samsung phones from the beginning. This one, though, is terrible. So many issues. The texting rarely works well. Close to impossible to take a screen shot. Wifi goes off and on. Bad antenna. Would not ring for months. Took it to 2 Samsung repair places. Both had a different diagnosis. Samsung said there was nothing wrong and I would have to send it to Texas for analysis and they would not provide a backup or replace the phone. I bought from their Amazon online store directly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my s20 on standby before switching my service over. It lasted 10 days. Battery life with regular use last about a day and a half."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good after over a month of use. Camera is very good and clear. Battery could be better Two charge a day for normal use.
Finger print works flow less"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great purchase, as advertise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I previously purchased the same Samsung phone listed as unlocked, but when it arrived it was not, thus phone was returned.
This phone however arrived new and unlocked as it was advertised and works like a charm, already had a SIM and just swapped it out and transferred data/contacts/pics, etc. in just minutes. My first Samsung phone, wont be my last! No complaints with seller or phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has been pretty good to me in the short time that it lasted. The battery life was at 1% before it died completely only to never come back on. I charged it and still nothing. I only had this phone for 14 months. Now I am just out of luck"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Probably one of the better Samsung phones I have had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, when there should be 4's. Why? In June 2021, the sellers posted 8 GB of Ram and the phone only had 6 GB. That's false advertisement. Apparently they change their description off and on.
I lose power quicker than I imagined I would. My friend has a Samsung 9 and his power last longer than mine, go figure.

It's not a bad phone. Yet, sometimes I do wonder if it was refurbished and not new. Some little odd things here and there."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am very happy with my new Samsung phone. It is a 5G with updated software that makes it user friendly. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others. I do not use a lot of data because I mostly us my phone for routine things like calls, texts, GPS, information on interesting topics. I'm not a game player and this phone provides me with all the capabilities I need at a reasonable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cool phone. Came in without being broken or scratched. Works well and transferred everything over fine. It did however come in a bit late even though I paid for it to come faster."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Al ser un standar de la industria, deberían indicar previamente que no viene con un espacio para aumentar memoria a través de memorias SD (ni micro, ni mini, nada). Además tampoco puedes conectar tus auriculares en el equipo. Su rendimiento gráfico es excelente y su procesador es muy bueno, pero la batería no dura tanto como lo promocionado. Es importante saber que si eres de los que toma muchas fotografías, o descargas tus series o música en el teléfono, es obligado comprar espacio en la nube"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very pleased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall the phone works pretty well. Biggest issue found so far is getting a good screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader. None of the tempered glass ones we tried worked well. Ended up using a soft type.

The biggest concern is OS updates from Samsung. Compared to Apple as android phones don't seem to get updates promptly and support is not as long as an iPhone from what we can tell."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from S9 i was hesitant to got with this phone, lower screen resolution but higher frame rate wasnt enough..

I was also afraid the phone wouldnt be legit in Samsung Amazon store but wanted it asap, have prime so decided to buy it..
Came aoon enough, I dont do pics so the phone camara is not a biggy for me.

But i am blown away, the phone is quick, firgerprint reader work fast.. the position of it from the old S9 to S20fe is akward, i am used to the S9 firgerprint location but I am adapting.

Has all i need , Samsung pay, Secure folder.. though now u cant set a specific fingerprint to Secure folder, maybe they will fix that in updates..

Averall, impressed with it .. it is big.. and fast.. didnt needed to buy the flagship at all. This one has all I need."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love this phone! I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn't come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone, so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings, apps, etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.

The camera is miles better than my old one, but the selfie, front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan, like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating, but I'm not a selfie queen anyway, so I'm not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.

This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I'm pretty pleased!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung makes good hardware, so long as they aren't trying to force you pay for storage or wireless whatever. I like Android, but having had an s8+, gone to a Google pixel, then to this, i get they the os and what not might be tuned, but Google got it right and then samsung broke it hard core. The fruit may have great supporting software that rhymes with runes, but Google is making them prove they make better hardware, and it's Google all the way on OS, if you don't believe me, you have not used a Google phone, they just are better, I had more scam texts and calls in the first hour on this, than the last 4 years with my pixel, it's insane, I have a huge folder of all the samsung apps, because none of them work as well as the Google ones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I like about this phone:
It's faster and newer than my old Samsung J7, to be fair any 2020 phone is probably better than an old J7.
Love the wireless charging. I like the bigger screen and image quality is super nice, even compare to other 2020 phones. Sound is clear, even at maximum volume.
What I wish it had:
Expandable memory slot
I know other versions have it, this one doesn't. Storage is 128gb, which is plenty since I usually don't keep important files in my phone. Encrypted files in the cloud 😊
As far as 5G is concerned, it works well but there at times is really slow, so it's off for now.
In summary, I am very happy with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Big learning curve from a S6 to this one. Took 3 days just to get use to it and still can't get the buttons right to turn it off. Great color! both inside and out. Most of the features and apps I will probably never use and added a few I do use. Vendor was quick to get it here no problems,
."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I've had for years. I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20. I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network. According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn't purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it's false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating). I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home, started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon, boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store. If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I'm stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work. I'm looking at the Galaxy A52 as it's similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon. I refuse to pay $1,000+ for an S series phone.😠"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's unlocked so any carrier can be used with it and the camera is one of my favorite default apps to use simply because it's so crisp and clear. Even at 30x zoom it's still clear enough to read small signs about 10 cars away"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Disliked the facial & fingerprint reader, battey life was very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone in late March and on Sept 5, the phone’s charging dock started to have issues. I can no longer charge the phone via cable. I immediately contacted Samsung, was directed to ubreakifix and best buy. However after 3 visits between 2 stores, they said they didn’t have the parts. Contacted samsung again and these were the options that they gave me:

1. Sent the phone to their service center and I was left with no phone for a week
2. Trade in but I have to pay the difference for a new phone
3. Or wait indefinitely for their parts to be available.

I asked if they could send the parts to the authorized service center, ubreakifix/ best buy or my house, but they said that they couldn’t. The part that I dont understand is if they could fix my phone when I mailed it in, why can’t they send the parts to other places so I can have it fix in 30 mins or so on those authorized service center? Additionally, there is no way to get in contaxt with supervisor as well. So now I was left with $600+ phone that can’t be charged through cable. God knows if soon the battery will die on me too. Bad product but even worse customer service. Only last for 6 months before started to have issues!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Going from an older IPhone to this Android has proven to be a bit of a learning curve for a senior citizen. We purchased this phone because it was hearing aid compatible. We've had a bit of problem syncing the phone and the hearing aids but that may be more the app than the phone. It has a great battery life and the camera is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone but speaker phone is not great, hard to hear even with volume at max."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung is the second biggest name in the phone and this one is pretty good one.
Everything works perfect and responsive until I ran into a glitch of the screen going dark once in a while. And I have to restart to reboot. Perhaps I got a lemon, but I contacted Amazon and they took care of the problem by refunding it immediately, after my return of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Somehow the sensitivity on this never works out with the case and 2 different screen protectors I have used. I ended up ditching the cases. When doing so, be sure to switch sensitivity on it.

The camera and audio works decently. I've taken quite a few sharp photos, but just getting it now, I see the battery issue depending on apps used is a consistent problem.

The sensor for the fingerprint tip is terrible. I do have some scarring, but I can't get through it and samsung with it's security makes it difficult to bypass certain issues as they pop up seemingly at random and make me spend time going back and figuring out how to get the helpful screen to go away and leave me alone.

I like this so much I decided to purchase a different phone. I know something is wrong with a product when I pine for the s9+ with its 'edge' issues."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this for my daughters 15th. She hasn't complained once! So it must be pretty good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very upsetting 😡 to me when I purchase a cellphone and there isn't a wall plug in adapter included !!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llego en las fechas establecidas y físicamente esta en perfecto estado"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone, every feature is top notch. Picture and video quality is a A1. The speed is A1. Face recognition is A1. Battery life is straight. A good buy for android users."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It’s ok"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worthy to buy, so far so good, I still want to see how it performs after 2, 3 years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice. An actual official phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wifes old samsung s8 required charging all the time.very inconvenient and annoyed her.
Bought her this with more memory, more storage, better hardware. It stays charged all the time. Worth every penny. She makes her living on the phone with her business, she doesnt complain anymore about her phone-priceless."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo envié para mi hijo a Cuba, y hoy es que pude enviarle el cargador, con una amiga que va para allá"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone came wrapped in the proper packing material and a samsung super fast charger, phone was as expected with a few barely noticeable scratches. Other than the screen scratches the phone is pretty much out of the retail box. Definitely legitimate samsung product for a lot less. The phone itself runs very smooth and was indeed factory unlocked, the in screen optical fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate, the face recognition uses the phones 32mp front camera and could use some work, but is still fairly reliable. Great and fast phone even in 2021, if you can get a good deal on a S20 FE 5G, it's definitely worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charger adapter included and the cord is the same size on both endends!! I should have paid attention when it said what's included ""TBD"". Buyer beware"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I did receive my Android phone, the 5G Tower being in repair for weeks on, and the screen lock being on without a passcode (to know and available) to unlock the phone. Also, I did need the phone for emergency reasons. The phone takes time to learn the general operating of the phone because the phone is not as intuitive as other Smartphones that I have purchase in the past. Because of all these complications, my initial experience with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Fe 5G being not so good. The 5G Tower--this is not the the fault of the makers of this phone. The passcode place on the phone's screen; I do not know whose fault that being.

Now, the focus being on the phone only...not what some outside influences did do wrong. It is a good phone that has almost boundless options for data protection and security options. It is a sleek looking phone with good and comfortable (handheld) scale and dimensions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far! Has a little delay when clicking on certain things but that could be user error, I'm not sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There's nothing I don't like about this phone so far. I did have a problem getting my email set up I had to go to my carrier to get help and all is good now. Hoping to have good luck with it for quite some time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The difference between my old reliable 4G phone and this one could be measured in light-years. This phone is phenomenally fast and easy to set up. The fan apparently did an excellent job in determining the factors to be included in the Fan Edition. It is so fast I had a near a quicker touch on the screen with my finger or I found myself lost. Super responsive, and clear and crisp display of vivid colors. I am enamored and likely to get in trouble as I can't stop fiddling with my phone to do my work."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got my new 21S FE phone, last night. just lightly use by playing around YouTube for about less than an hour, then I noticed the back of the phone, close to camera area, was hot. I just thought this is cheap phone, I read somewhere this phone has a hot issue while playing games (for more chip intensive usage). This morning I took the phone off wifi mode (since I am at home, phone automatically use my own WIFI for data), I want to check my att 5G speed again, but my S21 fe 5G is dead, thought phone clearly shows its under 5G coverage. when I first got the phone last night I immediately check 5G coverage, It OK, work in my area.
So, I have to suspect that last night's event of overheating that caused phones
's 5G chip dead.

Do I qualified to make this judgment without actual device testing?
I , as retired Intel chip reliability engineer for 20 some years, audited plenty of semiconductor for quality issues. This type of event is called dead of arrival , a type of early infant mortality. I just wonder, Samsung should be able to screen out this type of ""walking dead"" failure in house, unless someone is cutting corner here.

I am not happy with ATT too - 16 years loyal customer, they just cut my Huawei Mat 20 Pro off, that's why I have to purchase a new phone, but I am very unsuccessful found equal quality with equal price range replacement phone. Huawei Mat P20 pro which I used for 3 years, the price went up US$100 on Amazon. yes, the only phone I noticed price went up after 3 years used. The quality of my Huawei mat P20 Pro just has incredible reliability. There is reason Huawei is hated by every phone manufacturer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't tried the face recognition or fingerprint fingerprint reader battery life is OK"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased unlock S20 5G FE as an upgrade from an old S8. Great deal at just $450 each. Battery life is considerably better and the speed access apps is lightning fast. Easy upgrade that was straight-forward. So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this to replace the Pixel 3aXL I dropped. This is fine phone with excellent 5G features that has most of the features of the new premium phones for less than half the cost. It does come with the usual amount of Samsung crapware pre-installed, which was expected. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We were looking for new phones and got these on prime day. We didn't even have to get a new sim card, so there was no hassle whatsoever. We just traded the cards ans transferred the stuff on our phones over. So far so good. I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with battery life as my old phone which is a little bit of a disappointment, but otherwise they work fine so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone disappointed me it had way too many redundant apps for my taste. I much prefer stock android for it's simplicity and ease of use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Half the cost of phone companies, easy to set and operate excellent camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo lleve a un taller por que no reconocia la linea y me dijeron que era una copia despues me pusieron la lienea en otro lugar y funciono pero quisiera saber a alguien le han dicho que es una copia me quede con la duda por que lo pague como original"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy buen producto."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone does phone things value for money your better grabbing the 20fe instead."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great value for the price with solid performance in basically every area except for one: the touchscreen during keyboard swiping. Swiping on the screen often registers incorrectly multiple quick touches and THEN what's left of the swipe. Needless to say, this poses problems for multiple apps but none worse than trying to type on the keyboard (3rd party keyboards don't fix the problem). This has been incredibly frustrating trying to communicate through text or email, or merely typing in search strings etc.

The fact that this one fault is a HUGE inconvenience and hasn't been fixed despite multiple software and firmware updates from Samsung for over a YEAR , tells me two things are likely:
1) it's not going to ever be fixed
2) it's possibly a hardware defect

For this reason, I wish I could recommend this phone, because I otherwise really like it, but I can't. Samsung deserves less than 1 star for not supporting this ""affordable flagship"" phone like it should. This was my first Samsung phone in many years and it may be my last (even typing this review on the phone took an extra several minutes having to go back and correct swiped words that the phone wrongly broke up into smaller touches)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La batería, cámaras, son geniales tiene todas las funciones de un flagship tal como sus hermanos mayores los s20, la fluidez de la pantalla a 128 hertz es genial, sin embargo con la última actualización he notado algo de lag al momento de abrir la aplicación de la cámara, espero mejore con actualizaciones futuras, y si o si es necesario usar vidrio templado ya que con el poco tiempo que llevo de uso y haciendo énfasis que lo he cuidado bastante, sin embargo ya tengo varios rayones y hasta en el vidrio de la parte de la cámara así que si o si vidrios templados para pantalla y modulo de cámara!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","To me a phone should be able to 1- make calls and 2- text. Yes they do more but those are the 2 main things. This phone cannot get pics via text! I hate it. Nothing online helps. Samsung knows it and nothing is done. I can't believe I spent money after reading so many great reviews and now I'm stuck."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone last all day for me and I never feel that I am going to run out of battery. I love the cameras, they take great photos even at night. The phone is fast and runs smoothly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone will last all day and then some on battery. I always plug it in at night, but it still has lots of battery left. Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and other times it does. Not sure what the difference is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone but the battery life isn't very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder why

I wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I ""upgraded"" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.

Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.

Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","How long most I wait for my refund. I have not received my refund. The phone had issues with connection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you, this phone is beyond perfect, a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+. The battery life is superb, the multiple options to customize the UI is amazing, the security that this phone provides is simply phenomenal. You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off, at an affordable price! (Bought this phone when it was at $600 maybe you can get it at the same price or better) Why pay more for something similar when you can pay less for the same thing or better?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","excellent photos and the single take feature that selects photos from videos is great . the touch screen is sensitive and makes random selections if scrolling . comfortable size ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall, if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For the most part I like the phone. Coming from Pixel 6 I think this is a good phone. Very light and well made. The display is awesome. Battery life could be better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has been a solid upgrade for me, minus an issue with my service provider. After 4.5 hours in several stores, I was unable to get this unlocked phone to connect to the Sprint Network, and had to get my account transferred to T Mobile. Butt they're the same company now, aren't they? My wasted weekend says no. If you're a Sprint user, you can get it to work on T Mobile, eventually, so expect some frustration.

That said, battery life is awesome so far. I did change the refresh to 60 HZ from 120 HZ to help it last longer. Fingerprint reader has been flawless for me. Camera is awesome. Android transfer program moved most of my stuff over, although I did have to manually reload about half of my apps. In general, I love this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone overall. it is pretty speedy and the battery life is very good. I am not a camera connoisseur so I can't comment on whether the camera is all that it's supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I've only had it a couple of months but so far so good. I am not sure that it is worth the extra money over a phone that's about half the price for someone who doesn't really use the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have used this phone for almost a year, it runs smoothly, has a great screen and camera, and an SD card slot! It is a fantastic value with a lot of flagship features, but at a more affordable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had i a few months. Seems to work pretty well. A wee bit over priced like all o them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great handset, lil dussappointed by the screen size. Over all a beast.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this to upgrade my slowish Samsung A50. The Samsung S20 is really fast and I have been using it for about a month now and it is still very fast!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There was absolutely no written information in the case with this phone. If I were a new cell phone customer I would have had no clue how to activate or use it. I like the phone, especially the battery life. I replaced my old phone because the battery didn't hold a charge. In spite of getting technical support I have not been able to have the important dates in my contact list appear on my calendar. I have had to enter them manually, which is a pain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really looked forward to having a new Samsung. I loved the color, but unfortunately the speaker was not working well and neither was the camera when using the flash. When on a call I'd be talking and at random times the other person could not hear me at all. This also happened when I had them on speakerphone. Obviously, this is something very important when it comes to purchasing a phone: the other person must be able to hear you during the call. Next, when taking a photo with the flash in the photo came out really blue and foggy. However, if no flash was used during the day and or night mode the picture came out very nice. I also did notice that the phone's battery percentage would go down when not in use. I've never had these type of problems with any of the many Samsung phones I've owned. Hopefully the next one will be alot better as I do not plan on ever switching to an iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it. Initially, I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update. This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area. The battery is excellent. I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call. The camera is excellent. Although it has 5G capability, I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon. Oh, the top ""ribbon"" is a little tough to read. Its a great phone and at a great price. My wife likes it more than her iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just got the S20FE today and it looks pretty good so far, but the description on Amazon is pretty inaccurate.

This does NOT have 8gb RAM, only 6gb. This has been updated in the description now, but not when I bought it. Additionally, it does NOT come with the AKG headset which the description still says should be included. So if you don't have Bluetooth headphones, you're out of luck, or will still need to go buy a pair.

Customer service also did not help, the only solution is to return for a refund. I still need the phone so that's not a solution. All I wanted was for all the parts in the description to come."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a non-tech phone person this phone is great. The battery life is superb. I have been using an android phone since my 1st smart phone. More specifically Samsung. This is my 3rd Galaxy phone and it just keeps getting better and easier to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has a lot of fun features and options, love the camera, and the white back doesn't show fingerprints. Unfortunately I'm not able to review some features of the phone because it is not yet serviceable. This is really up to the buyer to contact your service provider first, of course. Spectrum (specifically) does not service this unlocked device until sometime maybe in January 2021. Possibly to due with 5G service and it being a super new device. Just an FYI as we're now left with two brand new wonderful phones without service and two quickly dying old phones trying to hang in there another month."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone expecting to use 2 sim cards and it turns out it can't. This phone is advertised with Dual Sim but it does not allow it and it does not say anywhere in the publication. This is something that should be clarified. Still the phone is very good, despite everything."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Started using Samsung devices from the Galaxy S8+, coming from years of using Sony Ericsson/Sony. I never switched back or changed brands because Samsung fully satisfied my mobile needs. Satisfied so far again with this Galaxy S21 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It took forever to come. I literally got it almost a week after the order date. Amazon told me to file a police report. I was sooo scared it had been stolen but since having it for about a day... it's so far so good. I like it a lot. Fingerprint works well haven't taken many pictures yet but the quality and zoom functions are pretty amazing. I hope it lives up to my expectations. Battery life doesn't last very long but it's not a MAJOR issue. Just holds a slightly less charge."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me agrado en lo absoluto, el teléfono es bueno, no se calienta demasiado al usar, tiene procesador Snapdragon, la cámara es buena, la temperatura manejable. mi dispositivo no me vino con la falla de los toques falsos en el táctil así que lo agradezco. Se confundieron al poner 8 GB de RAM cuando el que viene es de 6 GB RAM"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","product arrived quickly... works fine... no noticeable blemishes or defects... MUCH less expensive than new"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I don't like is that yahoo.com freezes on my phone. It doesn't do it on any of my other electronics. My phone has more than enough space and memory. It only happens on this app. I have to charge my phone daily. Maybe it's because I use it for everything instead of using my laptop."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Here it advertises 8GB RAM, but RAM is 6GB

Also, Samsung's website says display is 3200x1440. But that is a lie too. Display is 1080x2400

will return this phone. Shame on you Samsung (and Bezos).

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Microphone stopped working after exposed to a little water. Only the top Microphone works now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a situation where having TWO different phones on the same page leads to misunderstandings. I went down and deliberately searched under questions for microsd.
I found:
Q: Will this phone take a memory card ?
A: It is expandable using an microSD card up to 1tb.
By Amazon Customer on October 15, 2020

Well, that apparently referred to the S20, NOT the S21. I wouldn't have bought this thing. Now I get to see if I can return it. SInce I have now opened it up... I'm doubting.
LIsten: ONLY PUT ONE DAMN PHONE ON A PAGE. Putting more than one leads to misunderstandings.
My cynical side suspects this is done on purpose. I thought I had done enough searching but I guess I failed to see."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone for a replacement for my Motorola X4. I liked the color so decided not to buy a case however the phone is so slick that it kept sliding off various surfaces so I am waiting for my new clear case case to arrive. Fingerprint reader is very quick but the facial recognition is sporadic particularly compared to my daughters Apple 12. Speed is very good and the 90htz refresh is good but it eats more battery so I would switch to 60htz if not gaming. Power off icon is more difficult to use than it should be."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The modified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for 3 days. The only problem I cam across was when someone called while hooked up to my earbuds the call was not showing on my phone at all. I would hit the phone button and it would take me to recent calls or the keypad, I also tried pulling the top menu down to see if it would show as a notification but nothing. Kind of weird. Other than that, the phone was packaged great.

I used it on Cricket first then put the sim in for Metro. Truly unlocked no problems at all! Packaged great. I will update if anything changes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone for my teen and she loves it, well worth the price. The box itself did come like pictured and the phone was dusty as a result but the phone itself seemed untouched (other than by dust)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone the first time, it was not compatible with ATT's 5G. I called ATT and Samsung to confirm that it was not related to settings or IMEI registration. I thought the phone was defective and exchanged for another one. The second phone was not compatible with ATT 5G either. I only get LTE+, which is the faster version of 4G, but not 5G. However, it could be because ATT does not have a real 5G network yet.
The phone is fine, although I am quite disappointed that it is not compatible with ATT 5G, which was one of the reasons why I decided to buy this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the idea of this phone, take last year's flagship processor and build a cheaper quality phone around it. In practice, this is a 200$ xiaomi phone with worse cameras and batteries.

In performance and network features this thing is great. The ram and processor are great, so why did you slap these inferior 12mp grainy cameras on! Ya'll even put in an SD card slot!

Good lord this could have been the phone to DESTROY this mid range market... But Samsung missed it by a hair!

Honestly if it had a better camera and an aux port I would have been recommending it to everyone who had any care for phones and tech... But not with this 500$ poco phone equivalent with worse camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The FE additions to Galaxy phones gives you most all of the high end features without the high end cost! Great cameras, easy to use and a great phone like all Samsung Galaxy phones. Finally replaced my trusty S7 edge with this phone.
Change over from old apps to this phone could not be easier."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was offered at a great Black Friday price. When I received it, it would not start up regardless of what I did. The Amazon customer service rep and I contacted Samsung and they were not able to troubleshoot. I wanted to return the phone to Amazon and get a replacement but they are now out of stock. I'm willing to return the faulty phone and get a replacement but wanted my same Black Friday price. Amazon would not give that to me. The only option is a refund. They didn't seem particularly eager to make it work. I'm disappointed. Amazon has always been customer friendly in the past. Maybe Samsung will provide a replacement."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Todo el teléfono bello lo recomiendo mucho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easily transferred my information from my old phone. Easy to install sim and so card. Great reception. So far no downsides."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","great phone , does everything you need from a cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty expensive but this is the third Samsung phone I owned and I have no genitive comments to make... You get what you pay for.. Usually...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate. I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device. I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great. No Verizon calls, no Verizon store. This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon. I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out. No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was afraid it might be a fake, so I would have returned it. But this is very real. I have this phone for 7 months or more and it's for sure worth it. The camera quality is insane. That's what everyone tells me who I show my phone to. Battery life is awesome too. It can last you a whole day from 100 percent. From 70 percent it can last you 5 hours or more depending how much you use it. It's definitely worth it. I haven't used facial recognition so I couldn't tell you. But the finger print reader is really good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the wireless charging capability. I transferred my old phone sim card for instant 5G. Some Samsung apps should be disabled and there are several good videos on YT for tweaking. I would highly recommend this 2022 version of the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best reliable mobile phone at a great price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome product very satisfied especially with the camera features I recommend it very highly I will buy it again if I had to!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This US version has room for two nano SIMs but only #1 will work.
Maybe you can have a nano SIM + a e-SIM, but I didn't try.

If you want true dual SIM, buy the european version.
Comes with 2 IMEI nunbers on the box, actually works with 2 SIMs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery not performing as expected"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to upgrade my phone desperately. I went with the Samsung because its android and not iphone. The battery life is fantastic. Signal and reception are great. I totally love it!! Best purchase ever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5G as an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ok so I bought a new phone since TMobile kept blaming my Google Pixel 3A on my bad service ( dropped calls, no connection, no internet) and I am still having the same problems. Also I hate the biometric reader on the front! Backside is much more natural and convenient. Pictures are nice battery is about the same. So really mad I could have waited a while longer to shell out for a new phone and accessories."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! Smooth with good camera quality"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is great not much to complain about. The camera is really nice and the phone itself is a good size. Best upgrade I ever bought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed a phone and this one was a decent price. It's a lot like my other Samsung but it still has a lot for me to learn. Battery lasts longer than my old one. It's bigger than I wanted but I can deal with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Reasonable price, cheaper than bestbuy, and other stores. Battery life drains fast even in power saved mode. Is the only dislike I have so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is listed for $600.00 or so and giving the brand I was sure jm getting a good phone .
Mic is most my issue and so is the biometrics.

Wouldn't buy again or recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always had Samsung phones love them. I made a big mistake when ordering this phone i didn't follow the instructions and lost out on the trade-in."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Terrible that this phone comes With no SIM card. Obviously you’re ordering a phone for the next day because of emergencies. Two days later we’re still at Verizon trying to get the Sim card set up. Will be returning"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Biggest thing is that is you have to buy separate ear phones for this phone as the ones I had before do not work with this phone. I love the fingerprint reader. Battery life is good. I do not use the facial recognition so really do not have much to say about it. I've heard complaints about the size of the phone. I have no complaints. I absolutely love the amount of storage this phone has 128 G. This is one of the reasons I chose this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first recent Android phone. I had used iPhones for years, after retiring my old Galaxy S5 years ago.

I was absolutely blown away. For the price, this is an absolutely amazing phone. It's still a full-blown flagship, just with a plastic back and minus a camera. Huge battery. Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.

I loved it so much, I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+. But if you're not a tech snob like me, the S20 FE is a flagship without the extra flair."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For the price it's OK. Fingerprint reader is just ok. Battery life is great. I wish it had dual front speakers. I like that it has expandable storage. Samsung apps store has the Epic app with Fortnite. It also has a FREE app to watch select movies and shows. (Walking dead included with ads)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","These phone are very user friendly. Don't use face rec or fingerprint yet, seems to be charging fine. Just got you know"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good. I like it a lot. We will see down the road, but right now I would say that it was a good purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good battery life, camera, screen, etc. The only problem seems to be the 5G signal but I am not sure if it is the phone or the carrier problem. May be it is lacking some bands."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got the 8g 256. Phone is fast. Amazing quality. Didn't want to spend the 1300 on the S22 ULTRA. wish I did"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really everytime they get better with long lasting batteries (can last up to 2 days if not checking and using all the time) and also everytime better camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen doesn't light up on incoming calls.
Have to go through a couple of steps to answer call!
Calls other than priority still get through.
They should only be allowed to leave a message!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone seems fine so far. A little large but has good battery life a d camera. However, just received the phone and found a MUCH better price elsewhere even though this was purchased on Prime Day. Do your homework and do not assume that you will get the best prices on Prime Day!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is my first Samsung as I have only had LG in the past. I am an android plan and have used iPhone but not owned. Setup took awhile but that may have been user not the device itself. Many features including ones I have not tried yet. Takes great pictures for a phone which is what I was looking for. Very satisfied his first month of use. Used with tracking. Slim design and large screen but not too large for my smaller hands. Love it so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item as described"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a right size, fast phone. Camera not too good but ok. Battery life is acceptable (about 6 hrs screen on ?) .
Sometimes hard to use fingerprints for waking up because screen no response and you need to use side button wake-up
screen then fingerprint... other is when you using Google map make a phone call even you change to map it jump back to call screen automatically.
I used this phone two weeks only. Probably will update the review later. Now only can gave it 3 🌟
After few months, it slower than before. Looks like the phone from China is better but unfortunately cannot used in America. This is my first Samsung product. For me , it only acceptable.
Update from 10/15/22: some apps runs very slow sometimes. Not recothis this phone. Change to 2 star"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It came with a phone and nothing else. I had to go purchase all the accessories"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","could not send or recieve messages pictures, took to dealer and had problem resolved after 2 weeks and quite a hassle"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall I like this phone very much after a few weeks use. It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7, so there was no particular learning curve.
What I don't like is no fault of the hardware. The location and lock screen functions did not work well on the S7, and they don't on this phone either. That may be because of operator error."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love everything about this phone, no issues.
Like the camera, takes really nice pic."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update 5-7-22: UPS found the phone and delivered it to Amazon 5 days ago. And Amazon has still not scanned it to begin processing my refund. I'm beginning to think they have no intention of refunding me. Same story over and over with my questions going unanswered. They're reading off a script and could care less.

Update 4-30-22: Be careful returning something of this price. UPS lost it!!!!! And now I have to fight Amazon for a refund!! I am beyond angry! UPS says it's up to Amazon to give me a refund, even though they lost it. Amazon says I have to wait until they get it back, or call back May 10th and beg them again for my money back!

It's a major pain in the behind. Settings keep resetting on their own, pop ups happening with everything I do, it goes back to the previous app while I'm in the middle of something, and the camera focus is just awful. Battery life is ok, I guess. I'm not a heavy user and because of the way it's acting, I end up putting it down and walking away anyway. It's going to have to go back. Sorry, Samsung, but your older OS's where a lot better than this. Thank goodness I only needed this for a back up phone for the next time my iPhone screen goes black. I'll just get a cheap Moto. They work a lot better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Smaller screen then I expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone is as the description says only thing I noticed was I took the phone out the box phone is getting hot in my hand but I'll update after like a month 🙃"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm very pleased with this phone. I looks brand spanking new and works flawless. One of the best purchases thus far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrading from a Galaxy S6 makes this a very drastic upgrade. Adaptive display makes things scroll smooth, faster hardware makes for a snappy performance, upgraded OS is sweet, fast (enough) face recognition and fingerprint scanner and the camera... Oh the camera. Can't get enough of it.
The one thing I'd have to say makes me take of half a star is the battery life. A full charge lasts me literally 24hrs. Not sure if it was supposed to, but I was expecting something longer.
Other than that.... This phone is excellent!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not compatible, I was told it's not a 5g phone..my net work didn't work with the phone.. TMobile"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is nice, but it was disappointing to find out it does work with two sim cards as advertised and as the regular model does :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just replacing my old phone with an update."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The dual SIM function doesn't work. The software doesn't allow it, so having the dual SIM capacity on the phone is pointless.

Otherwise the phone is a very nice built phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My only complaint is that I bought this when it was the latest technology. A couple of weeks after I bought it they came out with the S-21. How are we supposed to stay up to date when they push them out so fast. Having said that, I got the FE edition. I haven't seen any difference than what the other versions offer. It's just less expensive."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from a Galaxy S9, no surprises. Phone works as it should, and audio is clear. Battery life between charges is good.

I recommend this phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say except I like Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this phone on the deal of the day. Great price for an unlocked phone! Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is fantastic. Coming from an lg g7, this screen is incredible. Super smooth and bright. The performance of the phone is very fast and being a Samsung, you get awesome features like super fast charging. And the battery life is great. For the price, I would recommend this to anyone, esp people who don't like the pricetag on phones these days."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely use a proper case with this phone. The screen shattered the very first time I dropped it. the front panel uses an older, cheaper, less crack resistant gorilla glass than the flagship models have. Even with a solid case the screen may still shatter if you are a klutz who drops their phone frequently. The battery life is enough to last most people a day to a day and a half. The fingerprint reader is slower and less reliable than either of my previous two phones (S9+ and OnePlus 7T), but it does work. The 120hz display is great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I LOVE SAMSUNG"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is amazing compared to my galaxy s7 edge. The battery life is excellent, the first day I had the phone I was messing around with it all day and it only went down about 35%.
I've had no problems with the fingerprint scanner or facial recognition.
The front camera or selfie camera is a little grainy but the back camera is badass. All in all very pleased so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this during amazon prime day to replace mu google pixel 3a. It's great, there's nothing else to say about it. Face id works great, fingerprint reader works great, fast processor, great streaming quality (if you know what i mean 👀), and camera is pretty good, nothing compared to flagship phones but it's still better then most phones. Overall, 8/10, 8 because though everything else is good, it can't run high end games, like Genshin Impact."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone a lot. The fingerprint reader is almost as good a a dedicated button, but absolutely up to snuff for regular use. Facial recognition is good as well. I have had none of the touch screen bugs after 1 month of use.

Phone is snappy and fast processing. 5G is awesome if it's available to you. (I'm on t-mobile)

Camera is very good, love the 3x optical zoom.

120hz is a bit of a battery drainer so I mostly use 60hz when I'm out and about. With that I get all day use.

Overall for the price this is a winner."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is working perfectly. I love it. I really recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You just can't go wrong with an S series Galaxy. Love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything is doing well except becoming hot after moderate use or charging. Found it is normal for Samsung phones. Have to put it into battery saving mode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the clarity of the camera on the phone. The touch is great. The battery life sucks if you're a person who receives many calls"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Other than not having a headphone jack (WHY..???) - I'm very happy with this phone. All files including text messages, photos, documents, music - pretty much everything - transferred easily from my old phone to this one. Operating system is pretty much the same - also very nice. Not a fan of Bixby - it was easy to shut off. Stays charged for days. Happy with this purchase, for sure..!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am so happy with my purchase I ordered my phone in my fiancee's phone on a Sunday and both products came Monday at a decent time before we ate dinner the phones were great battery life is great everything about this phone is awesome I love that I can get ex ternal storage in internal storage I love the fact that this phone were able to put SD card in otherwise I wouldn't get that Galaxy S21 but I am so satisfied with my purchase and everything about this phone works amazingly him I just couldn't be more happy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that’s not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise I’m very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","He comprado 2 teléfono y la verdad funciona genial buena cámara dura la batería es rápido es perfecto"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hard to charge when it doesn't come with a charger!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","4 months ago I bought this and it works really well. No missing features or glitches. I use AT&T with 5g and it works really well. Camera is really nice. Snapdragon 865 is extremly fast! It came with a standard 15w charger but I had a spare 25w charger lying around. My only regret was I wish I had gotten the white colored one but wasn't in stock at the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Replaced a Motorola Android phone with this Galaxy S20 FE and can say that it far exceeds the quality of the Motorola. Don't let my lack of rating some of the options make you think that there is something wrong with them. I haven't fully gotten into those options so it would be unfair of me to rate them. I am well pleased with the function of the phone with everything that I have used. At a $599 price point this is a great phone that functions well without putting you in the poor house to buy it. I highly recommend it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it was on time . was easy to set up .the camera is great. I 'am very pleased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very sleek, easy to use phone with a lot of perks for what I paid."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone claims to be unlocked. However its NO COMPATIBLE with Verizon. Dont waste your money."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Did a lot of research. This phone proves to be capable and at a reasonable price for a workhorse phone these days. Phones can be expensive we all know. Arrived fast and in good condition. Great purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.
Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.
The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.
I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.
Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery doesn't last as long as my work IPhone or as expected. The color lavender is beautiful."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone went through a boot loop, powered off and never turned on again. Local Samsung repair shop can't fix it. I'm getting a dizzying runaround from both repair shop and Samsung. Repair shop says, ""contact Samsung"". Samsung says, ""bring to repair shop"". It's been over 3 weeks of this nonsense. One thing I know for certain: This is my last Samsung phone.

UPDATE: I had to send my phone directly to Samsung for repair. They informed me I was going to have to pay almost $500 for the repairs because it is out of warranty. Out of warranty??! Apparently it had ""unauthorized modifications"" made to motherboard and screen. I paid for a NEW phone not a refurbished one. The Samsung agent informed me I had been scammed. Now to see if Amazon and Assurion will hold up their end of the bargain here. If you are reading this: Learn from my costly mistake. Do not buy a cell phone on Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this is a great device if you dont want to fork out 400 dollars more for the s22"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good, unboxing, this phone definitely felt like the higher end flagships. Sturdy, a bit thicker with some weight to it. Screen is flawless so far, very reactive, and the colors are vibrant. It is an unlocked phone for GSM and adapted to the SIM card very quickly. Switching from Galaxy to Galaxy is also very easy with Smart Switch. I believe it was a good buy considering the A line of Galaxies are hot on it's heels with a similar price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It meets most of my expectations it's a very smooth and quick phone. I haven't seen any of the issues stated yet though I will say the battery doesn't hold as long as was stated and the only issue I've had so far is my phone kept freezing when I would click on the wifi button and when I went to restart the phone it wouldn't turn back on after 20mins. It's fine now but time will tell."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well, it's early days yet, however, unit functioning smoothly. Forgot to purchase SD card, though will not be in need for just now. Going through features, and will update review, at a later date. In the meanwhile, can easily recommend to others. Pricing could be somewhat reduced, in reflection of other units observed within that price range. One dislike, the bloating of unessential apps., maybe to justify cost. IDK."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The headphones are not included with the device, please send them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone battery life is last until the end of the day and the display wow. One con I do have with the phone is the glass on the phone it tends to scratch very easily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was my first large online purchase. Always worried about how hard it may be if something was wrong. Sure enough my phone had a small crack when it arrived. Got in touch with Amazon. They sent return labels to me and as soon they received the item, I received a full refund. Got another phone and it's great. I will shop with confidence now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took over a dozen attempts to store fingerprint. Finally got it to store one but it rarely works. End up using the pin. The rest of the phone is great. The s21 is much better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was in search of a new phone. One with more storage and better camera abilities. Samsung, as always, had just what I needed. I can now have my photography apps on my phone. And you can use SD card for additional storage (I like to save my pictures there). The camera is great... and there are more photo/video options then my last phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great storage, great pics, not so great battery life, price a bit high for the current experience I've had"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received in the mail so not much to review yet, not set up all the way. I do know that all my Samsung phones have been Great. Also I love the color."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I think my screen / keyboard has a dead spot or something. When trying to use the swype feature it'll skip or disconnect. Not sure what the heck is happening with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall good phone for the purchase price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is advertised as a dual sim, that's the main reason I got it, despite it has 2 Sim slots, the phone only supports 1 sim."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn’t like the fact that the cellphone, in fact, is not DUAL SIM which contradicts its technical specifications."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Smaller than I am used to but easy to use. Very pleased so far!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After I had my pixel 3axl for a year, I decided to get this samsung phone. This is easily without a doubt the best phone I owned. All specs are good and screen is a fluid and smooth display which I like. Borderline a really good phone. It feels premium (it basically is) but of course the higher end phones will have better specs and better looking screens. But this is probably the best phone on the market for this prices range. I recommend this phone 👍 it's been treating me well for the past 2 weeks and hopefully it will last me long"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great even tho I'd prefer Google-type Android."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I went from a Samsung 7 edge to a Google pixel 3 thinking I would have better pictures and a better phone. After 2 years of not being happy with pixel I chose Samsung S20 fe. I love this phone! Cameras are above expectations as well as all other aspects of the phone. Very responsive and easy to use. Goodbye Google Pixel 3. Only issue would be I thought I was buying a new phone, I have been unable to verify if refurbished. Box was sealed, a little dirty but phone was clean. I highly recommend Samsung S20 fe!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from a pixel 2xl this was a big upgrade for both me and my wife. It is great with the one exception that sometimes the touch screen bugs out and I need to restart it. It's maybe once a week it does that. Otherwise it is a really great phone with great performance and battery life especially at the price it is sold at."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from galaxy a20 this is a great upgrade and budget friendly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","la caja del celular llego abierta, puede que haya sido revisado en aduanas, al menos eso quiero pensar; todos los accesorios estaban ahi, hasta ahora todo me va de maravilla con el equipo. Esperemos que no me presente ningún problema pasados los 90 días que me da amazon. Rapidez en el envío, aunque internamente UPS tardo un poco en entregármelo. Gracias"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just a lil disappointed when they took the extra storage (SD card) away that was a big help on my older models! It's cool though😉"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's an pretty solid phone:+ Has pro features: * Fast charging compatibility * Wireless charging * Fast refresh screen at 120hz+ It makes the correct compromises: * Plastic rear with a nice finish, doesn't feel cheap * No curve screen (for some people its a plus)- Cons: * The included charger isn't the fast charger that matches the phone capability. * Doesn't include any extras: * No phone case * No earphones * No USB-C to headphone jack converter"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cell phone battery doesn't seem like it holds all day. My other cell held all day. Haven't used face or fingerprint reader yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So, coming from a Galaxy S7 I'm obviously in love with this phone. I have zero complaints. If you customize your phone correctly you'll have more than enough battery life and it charges very fast.The camera is just phenomenal. The phone is light but sturdy, and very easy for me to read as someone in their 40s.I'm just very happy with it. I would suggest buying a case on Amazon at the same time because I couldn't find one anywhere in town since it's an FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I gifted this to my husband. He works from home and mostly uses phone to be on webex meetings or conference calls atleast once a day for work reports. This phone hangs up/gets disconnected suddenly which never happened with his old phone. When he tries to reconnect to the call, he did not get connected. Sound quality is also not up to the mark. I gave two stars just for camera quality. Battery dies faster compared to his old phone. He switched back to his old phone, and I'm returning this. I bought S22+ for him which is arriving shortly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing has really been a problem for me out of this phone. It's awesome!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this back in June 21. It took me a while to adjust to converting from an iphone, but no problems getting around in the menus now. The big plus is I dropped in my 8 ft deep pool today and everything still works properly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My second Samsung, I found it pretty easy to use. Battery life seems good... A full day for me. Fingerprint reader works fine. Wish I could easily color code calendar items, but it seems that I can't. Nice phone tho. Like it a lot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Before I bought this phone I was a bit skeptical because of the reviews people wrote. But to my surpise it works just fine. I put in my sim card from my other phone it connected to my at&t service with no problem, the battery life is great, and the camera is awesome. I would only say i wish i had got the cool mint. But for anyone having doubts, my other phone was the galaxy zflip an that phone was a headache, this phone is way better thumbs up! 👍 👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is great and lasts longer than any other phone I've had. When using it I immediately noticed how fast and smooth it was from switching between apps and playing games and scrolling on Insta. I absolutely love it. I'm glad Samsung ditched the glass backs and went back to something more solid. It has a good size screen and nice weight to it. I added a Spigen case and screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The lack of clear instructions for a newbie. All the apps and ads put on in factory. I paid enough for the phone to not have the irritation of trying to disable them all. Weeks later and I still do not know most of what the phone does. Other than that it is a necessary evil. This is my first smart phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I thought i would recieve something to send my trade in back to factory ???"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone came ok, seemed previously opened but looked brand new. Arrived in time and all that but it will not work with US Cellular or Verizon (so they said) this is a GSA and us cellular and Verizon are CDMA. Still waiting for refund, 13 days later..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone found and received and looks in good shape, will update further once we had some time with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've always been happy with Samsung smartphones. After a lot of research, primarily focused on the camera and video capabilities, I went with this one. Oops. It does not follow action well and is a step down from my prior Samsung S10+. I use this for my everyday, but for pictures and video streaming I pulled out my old phone. My daughter also says the selfie mode is lacking."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the color, bought a clear case so I can see it. So far I'm happy with the phone and camera. There should be directions for using the camera instead of going to YouTube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got our Business phone up and running again, and without the huge charge AT&T prices their Cell phones for!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's a good all around phone. It has a lot of ""flagship"" features for a decent price. The in screen fingerprint reader is a little tricky to find until you get used to it. It has a good screen, cameras, processor, and battery. It's also nice to have a choice of six colors."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say, it's a Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You're always taking a gamble when you're ordering from a reseller, and it's always the luck of the draw on what you'll get. I'm a full-on nerd and would notice anything wrong or glitchy about a phone not to mention the way it looks... In my case I got an impeccable phone that performs impeccably and I couldn't be happier...My advice is to take the chance on this reseller and buy your phone. If it ends up being crap you can always send it back because you're buying from Amazon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The product was rated by PC Mag as the best 5g for the money. It's a great phone, a little taller than my old ASUS that died. Amazon delivered this phone within 3 hours of my ordering it along with the case I ordered. It's too big for my wife but I just ordered her the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, can't wait to see it. I am very impressed with Samsung..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is not as user-friendly as my LG was. Still working on finding all the settings that I am used to having and also trying to eliminate the ones I don't need or want. Best thing about this phone is the longer battery life."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Basically the title (but I will add this: I would recommend watching some tech reviewers and get their opinion before making a purchase). I'm docking one point for a weird bug that forced me to reset my phone (Android had failed to boot, then came back glitching with apps not working and whatever. It was weird, and i don't fully understand what caused it to happen)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All the things a smart phone should do -- quickly and reliably"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not much difference between this and my previous a51. I only got this because the charging ports kept failing on my other phones and this has wireless charging, but otherwise not worth the increase in price. Also comes with a USBc to USBc cable which requires you to buy an outlet adapter separately to even use your phone once you get it which is absolutely ridiculous."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My wife loves the color"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint reader works well. Other features are glitchy. The battery life is terrible."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Si feliz con los productos elegidos y recibidos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought used and arrived in great shape. Upgrade from S10 and chosen so that I would be able to keep using my 256 memory card. No issues with phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had earlier given this phone a 1 star when I thought it had no SD slot... but with the help of a friend... I located the slot behind the sim slot...this would have been explicitly stated in a diagram... but that I did not see ... am updating my review to 4 Star will increase or decrease my rating based on how the phone performs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charger found in the box. Please supply one otherwise the phone can’t work without a charger.Thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my Samsung fan edition. It does absolutely everything I need to use it for. It did not come with a user manual (fortunately I bought a book that showed me wonderful short cuts and useful information) I did have one incident of overheating with no obvious cause. I turned it off and did not use it for several hours. It has not done it again. Battery life is exceptional!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Absolutely loved the phone. I've been using it for about 1-2 months and it is still such a perfect phone. The camera is good but it doesn't zoom when you turn it to the front, but it's completely fine because it zooms a lot when you turn the camera to the rear. The battery life lasts me a long time, I'd say 2 days if you're using the phone. Fingerprint reader reads my fingerprints really well. Everything is working right!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works on Tmobile perfect. I am a happy customer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this phone so much that when mine was smashed intentionally into the concrete, it took two times at full human strength of a 6 foot tall man to make it not work anymore. I did not hesitate to replace it with the same SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The phone is great value for the money I spent. I also recommend this too. https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Samsung-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B08KFPG514/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_5/144-6656309-3446512?pd_rd_w=9j7YN&pf_rd_p=c5176ee3-b609-4196-9e4e-395444c24cf6&pf_rd_r=BDX5XCHK1A6WH7VR80A1&pd_rd_r=51830fd5-f828-4c59-b33e-a7d6c5e8e88d&pd_rd_wg=3qwHk&pd_rd_i=B08KFPG514&psc=1"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Initial thoughts on battery life were not so good, so I moved from 120Hz screen refresh rate to 60Hz and got an instant boost.However, later I moved back to 120Hz, because I paid for that feature, and to my surprise, the battery life was better. This must have been due to optimizations and the device learning how I use it.Overall, great, versatile triple camera, smooth 120Hz display and awesome software."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love everything about this phone. Very pleased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm hard on phones. This was a great 5g option for me that I don't hesitate to drag out in to the wilderness."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a hard time deciding between 2 other phones and this one, but I'm very happy so far with this S20 FE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable. Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ended up returning this phone. It’s a really good phone but I just personally didn’t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It’s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I’ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Cool color!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love my phone. Great pictures and long battery life. Didn't like that my charger is not 25W but a 15 so charging is not like 45 minutes to 1 hour instead of super fast charging capabilities. Has extra space for an SD card to increase your memory. 5G phone. Great for the price! FE doesn't have dual Sim so if you need that then buy the S20"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything about it! It's absolutely a small laptop and more!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","With the idea that I thought/expected this item to be less better than it actually is, it surprised more than what I thought, it came with a charger, it's headphones as well as every thing necessary for its function plus, it was actually unlocked unlike the first phone I bought, it is nice and amazing if I was able to buy another I would exactly right here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is everything you could ask for in a phone. The camera on this phone out performs the IPhone 12. All my friends with an IPhone were jealous of the camera. The camera is my favorite thing. 30× zoom is amazing. I could take pictures of animals from a good distance away without scaring them off. Incredible. I have had no trouble at all with this phone. There is zero lag. 120 hertz display is gorgeous. You will love this phone. It's a steal for 600 bucks"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone seems to be up to partner with the Samsung product quality. Nice. Stable. Structure. However. The charging unit is different from previous models (Mico USB perhaps?). Seems like it'll last though. The main reason I like Samsung..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love having the galaxy s20 fe, such a huge upgrade from my s8. The battery life is my only complaint. I've had it for 4 months now, and I can tell it's already not holding its battery life long. That makes it really frustrating sometimes. Other than that I love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Toma muy buenas fotos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente oferta y excelente equipo. 100% recomendado"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far it's a pretty cool phone. Really fast processor. Picks up 5G when it's around. Like that it has expandable storage. Fits well in my pocket even with the silicone case.Wish I could have different notification sounds not just one sound for everything."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have not set up face resolution. Fingerprint set up before putting Screensaver and might slow down the recognition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received these phones, we upgraded our house to three Galaxy S20's on Prime-Day Sale, we can't complain thus far. Very responsive and manageable with one hand. Easy to transfer over all files, easy to get the phone activated and running.... pull the sim form the old phone and pop it into the new GS20, start it up and on the 5G Hwy...I recommend so far *thumbs up*"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the best Samsung phone to date. It's the same feeling I felt when I got the Note 4 and S8+ years ago even though there are features in Note 4 and S8+ that aren't in S20 FE like taking your oxygen saturation which is important for me during pandemic, but still the phone is so good that you can forgive Samsung for not including that feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought 1 year ago. This Samsung FE20 5G does everything perfectly! !Best phone I ever had. Have owned 9 phones in last 18 years. Not one single issue.Samsungs are awesome !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The storage is good and it has alot of good features but the battery could be alot better. I love the fingerprint reader but if you use wifi or Bluetooth for anything the phone will die in just a few hrs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","ProsFast ChargingWireless ChargingNice zoom and camera colors for that back cameraLots of Ram for GamesSamsung DEXConsreally REALLY poor front facing cameraOnly allows i think 4 finger prints that often failThe charger it comes with doesn't seem to be Using the full charging potential"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded to this phone after my S8 died and boy do I love it.Had to get used to a bigger phone but otherwise the specs were awesomeIt's sleek, has a great camera, awesome processor and welcoming features abe UI. And for the price it comes, it just begs to be loved. So happy with it. Def recommend as a cheaper alternative to S21"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you are looking for a good purchase this is one.However I have found two draw backs it doesn't come with earphones and thenotification light has been removed.If you are OK with the two drawbacks listed it would be a good purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works and looks like a new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Before this phone I had a rinky dink free phone that was slow and laggy. I bought this and it was such a major upgrade. I use cricket cause I'm both Mexican and broke n I was able to use my old Sim card (I wasn't sure the phone would be compatible tbh). The phone came with everything it said it would come with and so far no problems whatsoever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well this is a definitely a big upgrade from my lg g stylo 5. With plenty of space on the phone, faster ram and better battery life the phone is really great. And the camera is by far one of the best I've used in a long time. Well worth the money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I switched from the Samsung A12 to this. I was sent one of these phones and realized quickly that the battery life was not good. My old phone had a better battery. So I sent it back and got another sent. This seems to have slightly better battery but wont last me all day. I can get through probably 8 or 9 hours of on and off use on this phone before having to charge. Considering I got it on sale I would say the $100 dollar savings compensates for this but still a little upset."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","nice one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Maybe I got a bad S21FE but my screen has cracked in two places in less than a week. Otherwise I was fairly happy with the phone. I've never broken a screen before but this one first broke while it was in the cupholder of my car, it was fine when I put it in the cupholder but cracked when I took it out. The next day I put the phone in my gym shorts pocket with nothing else in the pocket and drove to the gym, when I took it out while walking into the gym I found another crack. Back to my old S9 since I just wasted $600 on this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only received it today because of local delays due to CV19. However, on the US side, delivery was fast! Love the colour! So far, so good!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is not very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery lasts ALL day. Glad I got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone does everything I need it to do and it does is well. The only problem I have is the back of the phone can pick up fingerprints really easy. But other than that its perfect. The battery life is also amazing I can go through the whole day using it at max performance and I still have battery left over."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this for my son and he loves it. We haven't had any problems with it. He says the sound is great on it and the battery life is good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered the Cloud Orange, as Orange is my favorite colour. Problem is, it's not even orange. It's a peach color. So I'm returning it and getting the Mint Green instead. Otherwise, phone is responsive and works great. Good Photos as well. Happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","5 weeks in and 2 firmware upgrades and it gets better and better.Finger sensor still misses sometimes but not a constant issue. Software so far is spot on no wanky issues.Speaker is plenty loud. Lots of bloatware but fairly easy to remove.Battery last all day if not constant video watching."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked its speed of operation, its sharp screen, its stereo speakers. I didn't like the lack of a pulse oxidizer like my s7 had. Samsung smart switch worked well in transferring data."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works well! Phone arrived new and unlocked as advertised! Easy to switch SIM card from old Samsung phone to this new S20 FE 5G model! Love the screen size, east to read for ageing eyes! Phone functions as expected! Apps and data was transferred easily and automatically through ""smart switch"" Happy with purchase, would recommend!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works great, big improvement and upgrade from my ancient Galaxy S5 LOL. Runs quick and is nice to not have the carriers bloatware installed. Screen is sharp and bright, 120hz is also a plus. Been using my phone much more since upgraded to this.Update, if you want 5g to work with ATT Prepaid, make sure you update your IMEI number online or at the store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is THE BOMB!! I absolutely love it 😀. Although, I am upgrading from a Samsung galaxy S7... kinda a big upgrade, but I can tell you, this phone is worth it. I loads fast, its stylish, and it comes in many colors. The only issue I've had is I can't find many good cases for the phone in store around me. This phone at the moment is still kinda new, so finding a good case can be a little bit of a challange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What a great phone and value. If you're looking for a flagship phone minus just a very few bells and whistles look no further. This phone is amazing, fast and has a great camera and features. Came unlocked as advertised. Did the transfer from my old S7 by myself with no problems. Highly recommended! Saved a lot of money!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not used face or fingerprint recognition on the device. I find the pattern lock screen works best for me. This is an awesome phone though have only had a few days and it keeps getting better. I had a lower end samsung phone before this one and wow what a difference. Smart switch is awesome also worked flawlessly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The 2020 Black Friday price ($549) made Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G a great deal at Amazon. It is a function-rich phone with good quality. Everything works as expected. I have no problem with it so far. It does feel a little bulky and heavy, needing some time to get use to it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have been using this phone for almost a month and it's amazing. It's superfast and smoothe. The battery life on this phone is really good. It also takes a short time to recharge. The display is beautiful and my favorite feature is the dolby atmos sound that comes from both speakers. With the high refresh rate the battery life is still excellent. A decision you would not regret. Buy it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I put in my old Verizon SIM card and it works! Much faster than my old Samsung J7V. Fast forward 3 months. I tried to switch to Xfinity (supposedly uses Verizon equipment) and the IMEI search said it is not compatible. I can switch to AT&T but they suck here."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unlocked phone using Verizon service and this phone is the worst ever! The most awful coverage for one but I am going to try t-mobile. The phone itself is nice and light and very slim. Takes decent photos and is fairly quick using wifi but that's where it ends. The operating system does not like this phone which makes it horrible. Touch screen doesn't react a lot leaving you pounding the screen in frustration. The phone lags and freezes at times when doing things of little processing power. It will then freak out to catch up and by then you're ready to take a hammer to it! This is the norm and not a rarity. Samsung has been putting out trash lately and it makes me question if I'll go to the Z fold phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved the product. No issuesWorked fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Beware of no headphone jack, solution: buy an adapter. I panicked at firts because I don't like be charging constantly Bluetooth headphones. The phone is beatifull designed and the images and photos won't disappoint. But for the prize should include the adaptor and headphones.I just got it so I may update again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Brand new phone. Seems to be fully unlocked as I'm using in Dominican Republic and all company's sim cards works perfectly.I haven't encountered any issues with it. Battery life could be better but maybe is because I'm too happy to stop playing with it lol.Camera could be better, specially the ""30x zoom"" which is bs, but I didn't really buy it for the camera so I don't care."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall the s21fe is a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This replaced my very cheapie moto G6, which was ok, but the charging port was getting wonky and not worth fixing. This is a faster phone for downloads. A bigger screen. Not light in weight. Still getting used to it, but I like this S20 so far. It was a very good deal on Prime Day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone came already opened. The phone seams fine though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just what I expected. It works perfectly in Honduras. I definitely recommend it 👌"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was replacing a Redmi K20 Pro after it started showing problems with the display. I was certainly amazed with the features on the device as well as its performance. I loved the utility to transfer the information from the old phone to this one. The battery life is great. When the time comes to replace it, I'll probably go with another Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've had so far! I love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung FE 5G is a great device. Face unlock is not as fast as the OnePlus 7T and other one Plus devices. The 865 snapdragon is more than enough processing power you will ever need. Great display altho wish it had gorilla glass 5 or 6 vs the older Gorilla glass 3 version . Put on a case and screen protector and you will love the brilliant display and solid performance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb, and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though! The front-facing camera has a little silver ring around it that makes it super noticable, and the phone seems to get pretty hot due to the plastic back, but otherwise I'm pretty impressed with this thing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Since starting writing this review, this brand new from the box phone has updated with the same description for the 17th and 18th times. I have not been able to do anything with the phone. If I attempt to open anything in the phone,it was postpone update. I've had to keep the screen lit up and have tried everything but I do not see an end in sight at all. I need a phone. Even if it actually is updating real necessary updates, this is ridiculous. I checked to see if the storage amount changed at all but it seems to be the same after supposedly several cycles of updates. I will be returning it and going to the phone store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The reviews are right. This is an awesome phone. People say its great for the money but that I feel degrades the perception associated with it. This phone does everything I need it to do but be advised the speakers seem a little soft, the fingerprint scanner is a little laggy. The batter however is a monster . Nothing to complain about. Love this device I think I made a smart choice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone after I lost my budget android (Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s) and it was the perfect fit for me. The quality of the finger printer was surprising and quite convenient under the screen, and a found the battery life to last me throughout the day consistently. Great phone if you are trying to spend a little less money but still get a pretty high end product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was skeptical at first but the phone was delivered on time! Everything came as it should and brand new!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone, no problems, not too big."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is powerful and fast, the camera is very good. Using the Samsung app, transferring data from my old phone to the Galaxy was simple. The phone is slippery and you should order a case when you purchase the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't had a Samsung since my old S6. Was buying cheapies for a few years and it just has not been worth it. Ever so glad to back with Samsung because quality is indeed the less expensive way to go. Do yourself a favour and DuckDuckGo ""Boots theory of wealth"" to see what I mean.Sure the S20 FE 5G is not fully an S20 or S20+, but it is a very nice device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was a great upgrade for me. I got the 128gb with SD card slot and I am in California and it's hooked up with t-mobile no issues. All in all we'll worth the purchase for the moment, but will keep my eyes open on the s21 fe should it be similar."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had LG phones for a number of years. They worked very well, but had problems, and didn’t last that long.Replaced with this Samsung S20FE. Right away, I can tell that this Samsung is inferior. Issues with face recognition, fingerprints, finding downloads, talk to text is terrible, etc. etc. My only hope is that it lasts like three years."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm in love with this phone, and I'm not even a phone person. I had grown increasingly unimpressed by the IPhone family of phones. I have an acquaintance who has the Note, and I began researching Samsung products. The picture is so vivid when I play a video, the camera is wonderful. I could go on and on... I think I'm sold on the Samsung mobile phone line!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","did not recieve a phone charger with s21 phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Man, like the phone but ""cloud red"" equals PINK. Not happy with the color or the representation of the color on the website. Hate that I purchased a clear case for it. I guess I just live with it for 2 years. Probably buy another case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for about a month now and let me tell you it's great, I love the camera quality and the battery life. Keep in mind that I use it heavily, sometimes I'm in ft for 9h and the phone keeps running perfectly fine while connected to the charger and it never overheats. I definitely recommend it, it's worth the price and more"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great phone. Even being ""renewed"" it was in right out of the box condition. Had issues trying to figure out why it wouldn't upgrade to 5g service(because I'm using my Samsung so sim card). Truly an excellent phone at an excellent price. It takes great photos too. The phot of the moon was taken at max zoom."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente compra"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is fast, perfectly sized, and works wonderfully. I like it much better than my iphone 11. I also have a Xiaomi and prefer this samsung. The camera has great zoom and can take beautiful pictures in low light. Definitely recommend this phone. Battery life is decent.Con:I am not a huge fan of the on-screen fingerprint sensor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing product for 549 very competitive against iphones and other Android phones. Very capable triple camera setup, fast 120fps display, fast charging, long battery life and good software support. I highly recommend this device, it also has certain features the s21 doesn't have, for a cheaper price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","very satisfied great camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I needed to replace my old phone and this one was recommended by my son in law. Haven't tried the face recognition or the fingerprint reader yet, but the battery life is good. Was a little hesitant on the price though, only because I don't use my phone much, mostly for games, social media and internet. I did find one for a good price though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This replaced a Samsung Galaxy S6 which was good for years but didn't last long on a charge anymore.Great screen and camera, lots of advanced features, and excellent battery life. I transferred everything over from the old S6 with the Samsung SmartSwitch program over the network and that worked perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good~!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a awesome flagship spec phone! Excellent screen size ,smooth hardware power and great value for the price today!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have not yet used the fingerprint or face recognition features. I fear that I may not have this phone for 2-3 years - my usual phone life. This phone is sometimes hot, even while sitting there unused, and sometimes it overheats while charging. Other than that, I really like the phone, it is a little big (with a case, it does not fit the phone holder in my Toyota), but It is easy to use. I like that I can insert an SD card for storage - this is the reason that I purchased the S20 FE 5G, and not the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good one..worth to buy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I didn't receive my ejection pin... makes me wonder if this is a brand new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone hit almost all the checkmarks I had for a new phone. Besides the price, on sale for $549 on cyber Monday, it has a flat screen and no glass in the back - main reasons I stayed away from a regular S20.. It's also larger than the S20.. Performance is great; it's fast, has a great display, and a very responsive finger print reader.. Very pleased so far! Knock wood!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone for my wonderful wife. She absolutely loves it. It's a very pretty device. Not much more I can say about it because I don't use it. I can tell you that I'm waiting for the S 21s to take hold so I can afford to buy a new S 20 Ultra. See you in the funny papers, lol"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only after 8 months, I'm no longer able to send a picture outside of the Consumer Cellular network. For what ever reason, Consumer Cellular IT people are unable to fix this bug. The phone may work well on other networks, as it is a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Esta muy bonito el celular le pongo 4 estrellas por que en modo de vibrar no es muy fuerte"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a little taller than I would have liked. I used to have a s5 phone. Other than that so far so good. Battery seems to be lasting good. I think getting a case for it will help with the handling of the phone. A little slippery without one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from Galaxy S8 to take advantage of T-Mobile 5G network. I miss some features of the S8 like the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone and the notification light but in all the 5G is getting me much better coverage at my house where I need it the most. The phone works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen is totally black while in the camera app. but fine to use with other apps. Screen is not damaged and not misaligned, and it happened overnight--worked one day and not the next. I feel Samsung has NO customer service. Totally unhappy since the camera was the main reason I bought this phone. Apple will be my next phone I guess."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In the description it says dual sim, however sim 2 is not being read. Also it says 8gb of ram but when checked it's actually 6gb of ram."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a far and away improvement on my LG G6. Loads apps faster, clearer calls, and the Samsung built-in apps are keepers. So far, great battery life. One issue, my wife's phone lost network connection to T-Mobile, came back after reboot. Maybe need a new Sim card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the phone used and it had a small amount of scratches on it but, it seems to be working fine. The photos look good and the phone is fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So many problems, I don't know if I got a bad one or what.1. touch screen seemed iffy, sometimes it worked, other times I would have to tap several times2. Wireless android auto had constant dissconect issues3. Wired connections wouldn't work have the time, it would charge but data connections wouldn't work4. Network, wifi, and bluetooth issues, constant slow speeds (0.2 down), bluetooth was spotty and would disconnect often. A format would fix these issues then they would come back a few days later and I had only 2-3 apps installed since I used this for work.Amazon agreed to return it while outside the return period, but I am taking a loss on a ""restocking fee"", biggest dissapointment I have ever seen in a phone, especially one with flag ship specs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is advertised as a dual sim but it's not."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone 11 days and it was supposed to be an upgrade for me from a cheaper brand of smartphones. The cheaper brand was good, but didn't last long. Now I miss those cheap ones.My new 20 FE 5G sometimes won't read my fingerprint. Annoying, but I just enter my pin.However, last night I tried and failed - over and over - to copy and paste something. It appeared to copy, but kept pasting the previous text I'd copied.I don't have a lot of money and this was a stretch for me. Now I'm stuck with a crappy phone.EDIT I've now had this phone 3-3½ months and, without exaggeration, I can say I hate it.An alarm began ringing today and it only stopped when I turned off the phone.Calls come in and I only know I've gotten them when I find a voicemail or look at Recent Calls.To paraphrase a friend - You know how 'phone' is spelled? It starts with an 'F.'"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing to complain about"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Feature packed phone at a decent price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is far too expensive for what you get. Also if you plan to use a micro SD card you need to know this phone has no support for micro SD so you are stuck with the 128GB storage amount.Waste of money, for the price there are much better options. Plastic back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For a refurbished phone it was not cleaned properly; around the back camera and the scratches at the back were more than noticeable. If I knew better I would have paid the extra for a brand new phone. I do hope it will give me battery life and a good 2 or more years of use. Further to this I will be giving it a month of use and if any glitches would for sure contact Amazon and the seller"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We have two Samsung S20 Fe 5G smartphones. We purchase one directly from T-Mobile locked to T-Mobile we purchased this phone from Amazon unlocked. We had T-Mobile installed this phone on T-Mobile network. This phone will NOT connect to 5G T-Mobile network whereas the phone I purchased from T-Mobile will connect. All settings on both phones are identical."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is good and WAY more storage and memory than my old phone. But no plug for my earbuds and I don't like the wireless type earbuds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Mejor celular !!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has functional and touchscreen issues. Had to be pressing several times in order for it to recognize the touch, it has functional issues even after the phone is updated and overall was not a good experience. It felt like an old phone though ut was brand new. Very frustrating! Not recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","There are so many great features to this phone! Battery life is amazing, very user friendly, Great value for the money. Most phone companies want $700-$1000 for this phone 😳 So much technology for the price and the amount of storage is A+++I haven't used the face recognition yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got this for my birthday and was frustrated with it out of the box. I have an older Galaxy and fond it meet all my needs. The new Galaxy s20 FE is setup with the side power button automatically opening Bixby. . . total BS. Easy fix once you dig into the setting. The much bigger issue is Bluetooth, or I should say almost Bluetooth. It inconsistently recognizes devices. After multiple attempts finally got earbuds working.Hopefully I can get all the little annoying glitches figured out and make this a phone I won't regret getting."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very dissapointed. Biggest problem, the battery drains after 4/5 hour of light use (even with its battery saver mode and dark screen). I can't believe is so bad for a flagship phone. Face Recognition is terrible as well. Most of the time you are forced to enter your password. Avoid"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm very dissapointed due to the fact, this phone lacks Dual Sim. The only reason I bought this phone because it was discounted on Black Friday to $525 approx. I have to carry two phones with me now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I inserted and installed the sim card but the device won't recognize it and it's now jammed so I can not remove it. I tried going the esim route, but AT&T thinks it is a watch, so I can not use it for its primary function.It is pretty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got this phone and charged it to 100%. Hardly used it on two and a half hours and it's already lost 30%. Starting return as this phone won't last a day without normal use of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone sold at a much better price than any of the other places I looked.The battery life is really good. After heavy use there was still 50% battery at the end of the day.My wireless company was very helpful in getting it set up and transferring all the data.The old phone was getting tired and slow. This one is much faster"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone won't connect to a 5g network. Spent hours on the phone with Amazon and Samsung tech support with no help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because it was ""unlocked"" and the Seller advertised that you can ""choose your carrier."" I spend 6 months in the U.S. then 6 months in Mexico and do not want a phone with 2 SIM cards. With an unlocked phone I should be able to switch out SIM cards depending on which country I'm in. I've done that before with a phone I bought in Australia. This phone accepted my Mexico SIM card and worked fine in that country. But I just returned to the U.S. and have taken the phone to 3 major carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. Employees of each of those carriers told me that the phone is ""not compatible"" with their service and they could not get it to work! Of course when I contacted the Sellerhe/she said the warranty had expired and it was a Manufacturer's defect. I had no way of discovering the problem during the warranty period and the phone is not defective in any way! It's just not compatible with U.S. companies. Which means the Seller advertised it falsely in the first place!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We bought it on 2/5/22, and it worked well at the beginning, but it could not receive calls from 8/24/22. We transferred the SIM to the other old phone; it worked well in the old phone. We transferred the other SIM into this Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, it still could not receive calls. We reinstalled the system of this Samsung phone and updated it with a new system today (10/6/22), but it still could not receive calls. How to fix it, where to get the repairs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the phone but didn't like that it wasn't brand new. It gets hot. I love the fingerprint and I love the wireless charging. I work from my phone and it does exactly what I need with quality photos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am coming from a Samsung 7 and loved it. The battery was going and was debating of putting in another. I decided to go with the 5G option. It's the future. Screen is beautiful, vibe, camera is better than the 7 which I thought was good. Would buy again, and it was a great price when I purchased it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We moved from a Samsung Galaxy S 5 to the S 20 FE. Major leap in upgrade technology. Our 1st time buying an unlocked phone. Few hurdles for a couple of weeks. Now, still learning about all of the things I have NEVER heard of.Great Move on our part."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just the right size & performance"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it is fast, smooth, good camera, the only thing that bothers me is the weight . it is little heavier than my old phone (note 5). One other thing if you watching videos on you tube and if you try to fill the screen at first you think it looks really great but if you play same video on the device than you know it cut out some portion of the video"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the 2nd one our family has ourchased"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this on Prime Day sale for half the price and frankly it was a steal deal.This phone is so good, its as good as a flagship phone. Its got a large bright AMOLED display with one of the best camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a green tint when i would put the brightness below below 20% probably which would make other apps have a kind of gray and blurry view on the phone. After reading the comments i disregarded them because I knew about the phone but unfortunately I got a defected one . My mom and uncle got the same phone and theirs are fine and work great but i think I'll buy a different phone after returning. I noticed it right after the box so I personally didn't get to experience the phone for more then an hour before boxing it up again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone does not have visual voicemail mail. You can't pull up the phone see who left you messages! That totally blows. Deal breaker, had I known.The phone comes with a micro card slot, and takes up to 1 TB cards. Try that Apple.Battery life is great.Also the contact charger, erases the card. Doh!I would not purchase again!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this as an upgrade to my daughter's old S7. Outstanding phone and for the price...you can't beat this. Unlocked and only needed to go to a local Sprint/T-Mobile shop to get a Sprint SIM card and worked flawlessly. Highly recommended especially the color since the local Sprint/T-Mobile stores do not even sell in this Lavender color. A+++ Thank You."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was a gift for my grand daughter. Though it was not a open box item, as per her it's airphon was missing. Is it possible to obtain this missing item from the sellor?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought as gift, so far so good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Much faster than my Google Pixel 3. Worked like a charm right out of the box. Easy SIM card swap. I need to get used to the controls, as I have had Google phones for years. Fingerprint reader is perfect. Set it up to read your thumbprint . That way you can do everything with only one hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","found the phone to be hard to understand the functionality of thise phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After my mom was nagging me for a new phone (Motorola doesn't really hold up IMO), I bought her this one on the payment plan. So far she seems to love it, and I do notice the faster screen refresh compared to my S10e (Comparable to my Note I gave away). Its too big IMO but she loves it so I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super happy with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My wife is very happy with her new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Great photos, lots of space, excellent quality at an affordable price. The speakers are very strong, I suggest to lower it a little before your phone rings."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the cell phone I ordered. It's great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am surprise with this phone. It last all day without charging, even when I watch videos for long time. It has so many features that I'm still discovering. I got it during the Prime days (so glad I did)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The display is wonderful. Very smooth and vivid colors. I upgraded from an S8 and the phone is much more powerful. The transition was also seamless. The bigger screen/keyboard is taking some getting used to but it is a major upgrade. The camera is incredible as well with many more features than my previous phone's."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sorry to say that this is the second Galaxy phone I ordered by Amazon, the first one was defective, the second one should have been new, but was refurbished and the add did not say that."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the best cell phone that I have ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","good phone for money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the Samsung galaxy s20 fe 5g. I love the color. The size is great. I love the camera quality it is like I have a dslr camera. The video quality is fantastic. The processor in the phone is so fast to respond. I love the fingerprint sensor. I give thus phone 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Can't beat the price for what you get with this phone! Love it!The camera is amazing, finger print reader is fine, and the speaker is loud. Fluent when browsing. Its like a corvette with world class performance at affordable price. Snapdragon 865, 6 gb ram, 4500 mah battery size, 6.5 inch screen with 120 hz display. Simply unbeatable for the price!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perhaps one of the best phones on the market at a decent price.Camera is spot on great face unlock and a great display i have owned a galaxy s10 plus and never utilized the quad HDThis phones battery will last much longer than an s20 because its bigger and its resolution is not hitting that 1440P.s its 120hz is addictive"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't found it easy to use but then I am not a nerd. I have only had it a couple of weeks."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded to S20 FE from a Moto G 3rd Gen and wow was i behind on technology. The reason why I upgraded because the Moto G only had a 4gb internal storage and couldn't get apps on the 32gb microSD, so my apps were limited. I really love this phone and I'm sure I'll have it for years to come."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's thinner than the s9. Big fn whoop. The battery life is no better and that is what I really care about. They could make the battery twice as big and the phone wouldn't be noticeably heavier. So now I have to buy and lug a battery case just like i did with my s9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was very disappointed when I got the phone. It was a used phone but I was supposed to get a new phone .It didn't have the right cord and the seal on the box was broken; also no instructions. I am returning this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works good like most Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This has actually been a really great phone for the price. It does everything you want it to do if you just hang around tik tok and take alot of pics."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good value for the money, flagship specs but for a lower price. The only thing that cut me off guard was the color of the phone, i bought mint cloud but i looks like a pail blue kinda a71 baby blue. But other wise good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just received new Samsung. Have to adjust from apple. New learning curve."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty great phone. Camera quality is nice and although the fingerprint reader works 80% of the time its not a big enough deal to bring it down. Battery life lasts pretty long depending on what youre watching or doing. Charging takes awhile but if you turn on the fast charge its not so bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Zero stars if possible. The phone microphone broke in 3 short months. Although still under warranty, Samsung will not fix it. The local repair shop Samsung directed me to does not have parts for this phone because it is so new. I called Samsung and asked them to send a microphone to the repair shop. Samsung refused. Samsung's only ""solution"" is to mail them the phone for two weeks so they can decide whether to fix or replace it. Not a workable solution for a self-employed person reliant on a mobile phone for business. After 10+ years of buying Samsung Galaxy phones, I am finished with them. Avoid at all costs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is everything it says it would be. The battery last almost 3 days with moderate use. The signal is almost always full bars everywhere I go. The stereo speakers on the phone are a big plus with gaming. The screen refresh rate on it is crazy good. Perfect smartphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 Overall good product but was disappointed because it came without earphones.
Made in Vietnam
Amazon customer care compensated me for the earphones separately!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE"," Overall good product but was disappointed because it came without earphones.
Made in Vietnam
Amazon customer care compensated me for the earphones separately!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got everything from my old phone transferred over and set up and noticed the case was separated at one corner so set up return for replacement. Now I have the replacement and Good phone! Great price! Love all the features but the Battery not so good. I can't get more that 12 hours of not very heavy use before I have to charge again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update~Bought 2 replacement was also stuck in a loop! Replacement also repeated 2 words in a row in most sentences and added words. I called Samsung on the replacement. After close to 2 hours they admitted that it can't be fixed! They kept changing the subject until I forced a yes or no answer to the question, "" Can you fix this problem?"" Samsung said, "" No.""

I'm not the only one because I Google it. I've done it about 9 times and followed Samsung directions to wipe the cache. It did it 2 more times! Also Almost every sentence I write I write it will repeat 2 words in it twice and it just did it while I typed this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is a good cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone over all. I'm a bit disappointed at the battery life though. With light use the battery wouldn't last two days without recharging. Which honestly isn't terrible. But for a brand new phone I would have expected better and it's obvious not going to improve over time. Do love the camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the phome but there is something wrong with sim 2. It isnt reading my other sim ,dont know if its just me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was overdue for an upgrade phone. I usually buy ones that have been out for a couple of years. But the unlocked price of this phone sparked my interest. Not many reviews yet, but so far I am pleased. I Use TracFone and have no regrets. You get the same service as you do with being a major network customer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone itself but the battery does not last very long when it's 100% and I'm not using it it will be down to like 92% when I go to use my phone and then it drops quickly when you make a phone call so I'm really disappointed with the battery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought as a gift and it was so worth it great quality vibrant colors loud definitely would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It was exactly what I thought it would. Great job Samsung. Way to use all the leftover parts of the flagship and create a more affordable phone. I didn't come from a flagship phone, so this is the best phone I bought."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome smart phone, does it all and more. But I'm not able to use mobile data on 5G with t mobile. Haven't figure out if it's network or phone issue, neither t mobile or Samsung could help me fixing it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","By far the best phone we've ever had. Great photos. I doubt I'll ever figure out how to use it to it's full capabilities. Thanks Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good processing speed, no head phone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I opened the box and checked every detail of the phone and the accesories, there weren't the headphones and that was dissapointed because I review the description and what comes with the purchase, the headphones were part of the deal and didn't come, just the pack that comes the headphones but empty. The rest is OK, the port of the headphones is different is type C, so I can't used by old samsung headphones in the new model."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love it all, the feek, the look, how fast it is and not having y o charge every few hrs! It's awesome. Just love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is sooooooo BIG! Likens to Get Smarts shoe phone. I have a tablet and I wanted a phone. This is too big for my hand, my pocket, my purse-- it is just too big. Returned the phone and waiting for my refund. I've decided on a Z Flip. Please, please, please make small phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good phone...loved it..the only thing I didn't liked is that the front camera is on the screen..which interferes and is a little distraction and it does not look good on the screen..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've ever owned. I see a lot of people mentioning they have toch screen issues so if u don't know, when u first get the phone there is a thin layer plastic u have to peel off which if u don't may affect the touch. Other than that this really is a good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","HAD IT FOR ABOUT 22 DAYS & STOPPED WORKING. BUGGY PHONE - I DON, T KNOW. I HAD TO RETURN IT."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone isnt that great for playing video games, the screen not fast responsive. But For the most part it works great.! I liked it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have used a Samsung S6 Active for years but I finally purchased a new phone. I really miss the ease of shutting down or restarting the phone. You should never have to watch a video to find out how to do this simple task but it is a requirement here. Even then I forget and have to go out and search the net on how to do it again, again... Otherwise, it is a OK phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge beautiful screen, amazing sound with the Dolby atmos... all day long and still have battery. My eyes are bleeding and arms burning with the pains of a thousand bee stings...will never let go....jack..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have nothing but great things to say about my new phone! It's beautiful, the screen is amazing and bright, and it does everything I need and more. Highly recommend if your looking for a mod priced phone. Love Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Happy w/the price.... Thought it was fair !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrading from an S8 and disappointed to see the multifunction rgb led is discontinued, it lacks a blood O2 and pulse sensor, it's significantly bigger screen and weight. But this is the closest I could find with micro SD and a decent processor that's also 5G. My S8 lasted a solid 4 years I just don't see this one doing the same."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I hardly get less than a day of usage with sporadic video feeds and browsing. Considering these phones have to be replaced when the battery dies, the planned obsolescence is almost blatant."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like the S20 FE phone. I upgraded from a much older phone. It was a much needed upgrade. Everything runs much smoother. Battery life is better. Storage space is better. Camera is awesome! I LOVE it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nope. I bought it a couple months ago and it randomly just decided to never turn on again. The phone was very well taken care of. No cracks , no water damage, nothing. Yet it just stopped working. What a waste of money. 😡"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was just advise by a repair shop that repaired a broke screen for me, that this phone did not have a 5g antenna but a 4. False advertising!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What can I say, if you looking for a phone to last and with all the newest technology that the 1000 dollar phone have, then this is the one. It does everything great and for the price it's amazing. I picked it up for 550 brand new and I'm Happy with my purchase samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had it for just over a year. It was nothing special for the high cost. Started dying all the time. It would be at like 67o/o and then just die. So I sent it to Samsung so they could figure out what's wrong. They informed me that the motherboard went bad and since I was about a month and a half past the yrs warranty it would cost me $366 to fix it. Can't afford it so they sent it back. It was a very expensive phone but I bought it cuz it was supposed to be the best. Never again! Very disappointed with Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buen celular hasta el momento todo como lo esperaba"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hasta el momento no he tenido fallast, apenas tengo un mes que lo compre y me ha encantado todo ..
Solamente que esta versión ya no tiene entrada para los auriculares o para conectarlo al carro y escuchar música ya todo es vía Bluetooth"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Este es un muy bueno teléfono el reconocimiento facial es muy bueno así como el lector de huellas y la batería me dura para un día o dia imedio dependiendo de mi uso"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to finally get a decent phone and I was looking into this one because I really care about the camera quality. According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It's been a while since I've paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn't take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn't able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also, I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn't work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work, but other times it wouldn't. I spoke to a Amazon Tech, I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone, clear the data, the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn't working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works. It might just be a defective phone, but not satisfied especially since I had bought all the protection for this phone ahead of time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is running fast and has all good features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone can your budget phone if you're not looking to speed thousand into high end. It can goes up against Oneplus 8T and Pixel 5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No me deja meter a mi samsung account 😤 y no puedo abrir aplicaciónes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Another great android phone. Purchased during prime day - def worth the money. (previous phone was 5+ years old). Love that it doesn't come loaded with a bunch of service providers apps that are uncessary."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is such a large upgrade from my old phone. The screen resolution, faster processing and the ability to is 5g has been such a game changer. The phone is super fast, it's reliable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Use for gift"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it, however, it is VERY hard to find cases for it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Viewing videos on the large sceeen is wonderful and the video quality is exceptional. The camera is amazing. This
phone is just the right size for one-handed manipulation and pack with features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint recognition is great, facial recognition is lighting fast. The batter lasts all day and then some. When on the internet there is no lag with surfing and / or watching netflix on the device. I use the hotspot alot and no issues there. I would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I replaced my Galaxy J7 with this phone and the upgrade was huge! It runs so much faster and smoother, and I can actually take decent pictures now. All I had to do was move the T-Mobile chip over from my old phone. Well worth the purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone isn't that bad, however I'm not giving it 5 stars because of 2 main reasons. 1) The battery life isn't as good as some people would claim in my opinion. And 2) every since it receive an software update, part of my screen would just stop working every so often and my home button also won't work for a period of time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Estaba nerviosa por ser la primera vez que compro un cel por este medio. Por suerte me fue bien, estoy contenta con mi celular, tengo más de una semana usándolo, hasta ahora todo excelente."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is totally unlocked and works with gsm card of differents counries(USA and Argentina, for instance). Also works great and the cameras are excelents, also the screen is crystal clear. I think this phone is a bang for the buck! The transition from from my old S9 was without any glitch."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Oh my gosh do I love this phone, this is a replacement for my old Galaxy S8+. This one is for sure superior. Great sound quality, significantly louder than the S8+. The pictures are just amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is not functioning, the phone automatically mutes or unmutes, select function when not in use, sorry i purchase,"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El móvil funciona de maravilla. Lo único que me preocupó al principio fue una calentura en la batería mientras lo usé los primeros días. Todo lo demás está perfecto. Intacto sin rayaduras. Excelente 👌"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's OK, feels pretty midrange though, might as well get the Samsung A51 or A71. Battery drains a lot faster than on my iphone 11. You can get a full day if usage isn't heavy. Performance is really good, but other things like camera, screen speakers, etc...now a total wow."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung's “Privacy Police” and “Agreement” are striking: demand unconditional permission to collect all sorts of your personal information directly and indirectly and to create a profile with stunning visual audio text details that they would sell to anyone willing to pay for it, including “professional services organizations, such as auditors and law firms”. ""Law Firms""? What that means!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved the looks of this phone. In just under 6 weeks after the 90 day warranty expired the phone had problems. I took it to a professional who was able to diagnose a hard ware problem. I tried dealing with the seller and they washed their hands of me because it was beyond the warranty. I was out over $400! I talked with Amazon and they made good on it - except that I sent it back a week ago and haven't received confirmation yet! No money back and now I'm out the cash for another new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why ais this phone so dumb?

In the 10+ years of the expansion of smartphone technology, why do I suddenly have to care to write a post about how poor my experience of this smartphone is; within a week of purchasing it? Because it's dumb. It's almost patronizing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love some of the features and some I don't. But the phone so far has worked well. Having trouble finding otterbox defender case for it. The battery life is better than any other phone I have had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone for 2 days, and I'm very disappointed that the battery drains really fast. I had my previous Samsung phone for many years, and the battery lasted from early morning to late at night, with plenty of power remaining at day's end. I would think that this new ""5G"" phone would be better in all respects - especially a crucial function like battery life - than my old ""3G"" phone. I'm not sure if I want to keep this phone, or send it back as ""defective. """
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I would recommend to anyone to buy this phone I come from iPhone XS and I don’t regret at all switching, the S20 FE has so many cool features that you’ll love, also for the price you get high end phone specs, this must be the best 2020 phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Half the price of a similar Verizon phone, perfectly compatible, does everything I need and has plenty of RAM and storage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Decided on a Note 10 instead so I returned it which took FOREVER!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a S8 and was not going to spend 1000.00 on a new phone. I saw this phone during prime days and knew I had to get it. I have been pleased every since."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is the best, very fast processor. One of the best phone I ever had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i got the white color and bought the black case for it; also the glass screen protector for the front and the rear cameras.i see people complaing about the mistake that it was posted about being 8gb of ram.im just happy that i got it for 100$ off: thank God!thanks!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it so far uts to early yet .will see how it goes but I love the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very disappointing, after several calls to Amazon in trying to bypass the pattern code it keeps asking as the phone appears to be sync to prior owner. They had me call Samsung and Samsung referred me back to Amazon for them to fix the issue. Don’t waste your time or money The only solution from Amazon was for me to return the phone and get my money back as they do not any more phones to offer me at the great price it was."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone SPECIFICALLY for the DUAL SIM CARD functionality. Its very hard to get a factory unlocked dual sim-card phone in the USA for warranty issues. SAMSUNG announced in the press the S21FE5G would be the first, starting in January 2022. As of May 2022, SAMSUNG has not unlocked this functionality.....and the website has removed references to the Dual Sim-Card. Contacting Samsung support reveals they are still working on it, but OS update date is still unknown, and they will not estimate timing.As a stand-alone phones, is surprisingly poor. I agree with most of the other technically oriented reviews. Processor is clunky. Screen isn't great. Finger and facial recognition are unreliable. ANDROID OS not happy on this platform.I CAN NOT recommend this phone. ANOTHER Samsung fail!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am loving my new phone. It takes a little time trying to get used to the new phone. The battery life is wonderful compared to my galaxy 7 phone. I can not get the fingerprint reader to work for me. I'm trying the face recognition now."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I 've been trying to resolve problems (i.e. still can't access my voice mail) with Verizon, my server.. It has been a nightmare and under terrible conditions since I,ve been experiencing medical problems at the same time and I was unable to to receive important calls that went directly into my voice mail.Could this possibly be a malfunction with the phone?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","NOT a dual sim, as advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Have had this phone for about 2 months now and nothing but happy! Has good speed on our wireless network, clear calls, better photos than I ever expected from a phone!Not even a little regretful about this purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge battery life and so much faster than my old note 5. Yes I had my old phone since 2014."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It doesn't have audio aux jack 3.5mm output! Be aware of it and think if you like to play with adapters!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera is fantastic! Many settings. Exceptional pictures. Love all the memory. You can't go wrong with 1Terrabite with a sim card. Plus the memory of the phone. The phone was perfect. Brand new. Came quick and easy set up. Very pleased!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","hasn't triedall features yet surprised no slot for sd card Otherwise, do far, happy with phone and additional storage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery dead and will not charge"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone I got is defective. I reported it to their techs and after they couldn't find a fix, they shamelessly tried a trade in on me at a predatory rate. Longtime Samsung customer, this is my last Samsung device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was what I needed plus more, amazing display and battery life and the phone itself looks amazing. Delivery cam6 days earlier than expected which is a great bonus. Would recommend this phone to anyone as it is the best phone at its price point"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So did you buy this during prime days? The deal was amazing.Either way this FE model I have absolutely come to enjoy. The right size for your hands and good features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is THE phone people should buy if they're trying to get the best bang for their buck. You're essentially getting flagship specs in a phone that is 200-300 dollars cheaper than the more expensive flagship. If you're looking for a phone right now, you should really consider this one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","2 months buying this new S20 FE 5 G it became useless and won't work anymore for mobile communication. After 2/22 , 3G towers are being shut down and depending on exact IEMI # of phone won't be able to connect to service (doesn't go on model # and some older models will work like my wife's Galaxy S10 which is fine). Amazon is selling phones with discontinued and unserviceable technology and I was warned not to buy from places like Amazon by my service provider. Now I'm told after I wasted my money and only got a 2 month usage out of it. Not good Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am so delighted with my Samsung s20 android phone. The camera is awesome and allows me to take pictures 30x and still get amazing quality photos and videos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the finger print reader 😍My last phone was a Samsung Note 3, I had it until I had to get a new phone because Sprint went 5G. I hope this phone will be as good..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super fast, awesome features.....I only disliked having the headaches of transferring contents from my old S7 to this phone. Otherwise 👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Well I like the phone but battery 🔋 is draining quickly then usually and heats up quickly while I put it on charge and takes good pictures during the day and night it especially when it is night mode.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased last year. At first this was a great phone. Great battery life. Had a problem with constantly restarting which was eventually fixed by a software update. I upgraded my AT&T service to 5g. Didn't work so I went to an AT&T store to fix. They said it's the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone! Been using it for a month now it works perfect with my knock off carrier total wireless.. I have a car, screen protector, camera glass protector. It's going to last me a long while."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone carrier has not supported this IMEI model, thus far. The phone is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from a Samsung 7. What a difference---this phone/ computer is really fast. Love the 5g. This is a really large phone so handle one first."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loved my previous Galaxy S8, but since the battery can't be replaced, multiple charges were necessary every day. The FE S20 is blazingly faster, and 1 charge is good for 24 hours plus. A best buy rating from Consumer Reports sealed it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works like it should. Like the big screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Within two months the rear camera 1x started having issues and was no longer able to focus. Pictures were blurry."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is going well, it came sealed, in perfect shape very pleased so far. It was a gift, mom very happy as well with her birthday present."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a very sophisticated phone that makes more expensive phones look just as equal and this is by far just as good as an s21 in my own opinion"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","But cannot uninstall stock apps and does not include the headset. Amazon will not acknowledge it or the false advertising.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am liking my time with this phone so far. The only problem is that the fingerprint reader sometimes has trouble recognizing my prints."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is awesome I been a samsung fan since the galaxy s3. My one huge problem is the selfish camera. It's so awful. Why does it look so blurry I feel like I don't have my glasses on when I use it, please fix this as I myself am a huge selfie person."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Extremely user friendly love the fingerprint reader and the battery life the phone lasts more than one day before I have to charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Quite an upgrade from my 5 year old HTC. Nice display, good storage, big screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't used face recognition, the fingerprint scan stopped working. Other than this love this little phone & it takes great pics so far. Was worth the money for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its a really pleasant looking phone, the camera is pretty good, I've gotten some really nice pictures out of it but it's kinda a pain in my @ss. The screen is super touchy and it'll think I'm touching something when my hands aren't even on it. The battery life is solid and the call quality is nice. I don't think it's worth 600$ and honestly I preffered my old galaxy j7 but unfortunately it broke and the only thing I could do was upgrade. Overall it's a decent phone, works fine, just a bit annoying and not very friendly for non tech savvy people."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone so far! The technological differences can be seen in comparison to my old S8+. The Samsung S20 FE is way faster, the cameras are way better, and it looks way cleaner.Crazy how affordable this phone is for what you get from it. Definitely would recommend!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone! I use it all day long. Great display! Great sound! It has 2 speakers.Nice & fast! I look forward to using it for 5 years because it is so good!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far, this smartphone is performing very well, camera is very good, and battery is great. Under normal use, it can easily last two days. And it works internationally with any carrier (I'm using it in Europe)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Aside from the dodgy screen issues, the phone runs great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For it's price, this phone is ridiculously good. It's battery life and durability is rated higher than this year's iphones. And Samsung has seemed to improve their interface as well which was needed. Just an overall great phone cost aside."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung seems to have a corporate mission statement and philosophy: if it works, update it and make sure it doesn't! Our first Samsung phones were great and now they are just another pain in the A.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item arrived with 2 cracks on the screen product was advertised as used but no mention of any cracks on the main screen or phone itself not happy plus phone don't hold charge for 8 full hours have to charge in between"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The best Android phone that I ever had. Samsung S20 fe phone rivals the iPhone 12. I'm done with IPhones. The battery last all day to night time. Very responsive and more features than I expected. Great budget phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worth the money! Superb performance. The high refresh rate really gives a smooth feeling. The audio and video are great too. The fingerprint reader is not so fast and doesn't work sometimes when it gets a little wet but not like it is inconvenient!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Good phone, but do NOT buy if you're expecting this to be dual-sim: Samsung bricks up the 2nd sim slot in the US so only one sim can be used with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life has been incredible so far. No dropped calls and no other problems. I am very pleased with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone seems nice when you just got it...but a few months later the problem starts like ...freezing up not recognizing the touch and shutdown ever so often."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","look like old product & warranty only six months. website mentioned new one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Samsung G20FE 5G is a great phone for the price, great pics, expandable memory and fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is suppose to be a brand new phone, but the one I received appears to have something dirtyalong one corner of the phone. All other parts look fine. Functions are fine so far.Will monitor the phone. It is disgrace for Amazon and Samsung to sell used phone as new!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is like new even though I buy it as used but the only complaint I have is the box and the phone was full of hair. Like that was weird"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Long battery life, great pictures, love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","LOVE IT 💘"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a Galaxy S8 and this was so incredibly easy and quick to wirelessly transfer my contacts files and photos over to the S20 FE. No scratches or dents, brand new. Camera seems decent. So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered a new phone but the phone arrived with a sticky dirty screen and USB cord opened. I returned it right away. Because the phone doesn't appear to be new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This American version of this phone does not support a dual sim. I am not sure why phone manufacturers think Americans do not want a dual sim capability, but I have two phone numbers and I want them in the same phone. I sent it back. Otherwise its a very nice phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall good phone. Very fast, all the functions of a flagship. I don't know if it's just my phone, but battery life to me is lacking."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've by chance had a total of three of these in my family, so have a decent handle on them. For the specs on paper, it seems a good deal. But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent. One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone. Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues. Just Google it. All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts. The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying. I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Justo buscaba un buen teléfono y a un precio razonable. Hasta ahora todo bien ¡Gracias!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worked amazing the first 2 days, after that the battery life has gotten worse and worse. After a year, battery life is ridiculous. Have to charge it 2, 3 times a day.The storage space is fantastic.By ""lavender"" they actually mean pink."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone to replace my Galaxy S9. It was great for two weeks, but suddenly the screen started acting like a magnet stuck to a CRT television. Resetting the phone did not help and shutting it down and turning it back on only works for a few minutes before it returns to the glitchy screen. I plan on getting a replacement, but I can't rate it higher than two stars at the moment. I probably got a bad phone but I didn't drop it and it is in a very heavy duty case so I don't know what happened to cause this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Overall a good upgrade from my galaxy 8+ hope too use this one for 4 years before i upgrade again lol"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered another issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work. We are downto one star because this is not something I am ok with."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No complain except battery do not work long"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone lag on the touch screen, also run slow. My note 9 was faster and the functionality was better. On a good note super cute color and camera takes decent pictures"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was super happy with it, was super easy to put in my SIM card and SD Card and get it all set-up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone arrived with a hairline crack on the screen. It was returned back and a refund was received. Samsung phones are reported to have a weak signal. Samsung will blame it on the carrier and carrier will blame it on the manufacturer. I recommend that every smartphone buyer research the signal strength of the phone before purchasing it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the facial recognition. Lots of memory so I no longer have to delete apps to get new apps!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works really well with lots of programs and apps, as well as being pretty fluid as far as processing goes."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was mostly interested in the camera, and it works well. I am coming from an iPhone 6, so of course everything on the S20 FE is beyond better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the box the phone came in was very dirty, and when I opened the box the phone was very dusty. cleaned everything with lysol wipes. Other then that the phone itself is great! The screen, camera, and battery life are really good. works with my samsung watch 3. Since it is a Samsung phone I figured it would work with my Samsung gear 360 camera, my samsung s9 works perfectly with it. Unfortunately the 360 camera app is not compatible with this phone and will not connect to the camera. Just wanted to give a heads up for anyone that has this camera, I did not see anyone mention this issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the device. Battery life is a little iffy and there is a deep scratch on screen that wasn't mentioned but overall great condition. I am satisfied"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Communication and information"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Affordable and reliable. It has the latest technology and it is very easy to use. Highly Recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the BoxI return the phone because my cell phone company told me they were not gonna support my phone with 3G however my phone Samsung is able to use 4G and I have to switch providers but is but I also didn't have to buy a new $700 phone so I returned the phone and didn't even take this one out of the Box"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from the S10+ this phone is amazing for the price...the finger print scanner works flawlessly battery life lasts me all day and face recognition is on point 5 stars!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just purchased this Samsung S-20 FE 5G and love it! The price compared to all the other S-20's ...well, I couldn't justify spending an additional hundred bucks for a slight upgrade.

Kind regards,

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a great step up from the several levels of steps that are little better than a $200 phone."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So the phone worked fine till I got the update on July 3rd...After that the phone though I was in a different state/timezone, then all incoming calls went straight to voice mail.Samsung sent me to an authorized repair center where I was told the region of the phone was Denmark.They only have the US software and could not help me at this point.Lucky Amazon took it back after 37 days...Definitely says US version in the description"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I mean I'm no expert but it's a significant upgrade from my relic I had.Also dropped it in the toilet and it had no damage so thumbs-up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Charging port stopped working the same day return window ends (1 month). My old S6 has endured a thousand more drops than this S20 FE, but its charging port still works after 6 years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Huge upgrade for me. I love it, besides the no headphone port."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Slowest phone I have ever had. I HATE IT! I wish I didn't give my grandson my s10 because I would be using that now instead of constantly waiting for things to load. Don't buy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I came back to Samsung after couple of years with LG and so far I am happy. The battery life and cameras are terrific. Everything else works great as well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the battery is awesome and the camera is impressive. Make sure you note that it is an S20 fe model when looking for a protective case as the ones for the S20 won't fit."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This was so easy to transfer from my s9. I would recommend it for the lower price point, than the s21"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this nifty phone. Great that I purchased on Prime day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","el teléfono es bueno como usuario normal la batería me dura todo el día"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great product dont forget to change the setting to sensitive finger print reader if you have a glass case. Great phone my fiancee love it, its fast and it charges other phone if needed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life on this phone is absolutely terrible. It goes from 100% down to 80% within 2 hours. Just regular use, just texting and looking at emails."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pretty good phone, I like the fingerprint reader. A good upgrade from my J8, but the battery life could be better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for being refurbished! I would buy a phone from this company again!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is overall good. What I can say about the phone in a word that is I am satisfied with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone...no complaints! Takes wonderful pictures too. Fingerprint entry is always quick! I love this phone!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Seriously, shipping a $600 item in a cardbox box 3 times larger than original box, with little filler.The original box shifts and rattles within the shipping box. Remains to be seen if the product itself is undamagedThis is on you Amazon, nothing to do with the manufacturer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The fingerprint sensor works, the stereo speakers are awesome. I got the cloud white, love it. The amoled screen is beautiful. Phone is fast at everything it does. Great investment, you will not be disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Randomly restarts, Googled it & it's not uncommonSamsung says no know issues & wants me to send it in for repairs.Kinda funny if they don't know about."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Compre el teléfono y lo envie a Colombia por el casillero CondorBox , todo fue excelente, las bandas están liberadas y me funciono con CLARO COLOMBIA."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because it seemed like a good alternative to the more expensive Samsung phones like the S21 or Note 20. I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket, nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support, after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone. I have a Pixel now and would never go back to Samsung. This phone is poorly designed and breaks easily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband loved his new phone! Great price and awesome battery life! Thank you so much for a great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","What I like most, it a quality device and factory unlocked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just do it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llegó bien, dentro del tiempo fijado, la caja está abierto, seguro es normal ese. Procedimiento....y el producto...es según lo q quería....se recomiendan...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Since I bought this phone the speakers has not been working properly and I tried Device Care and it was no help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is fantastic for the price I was able to get it at. The battery life is also excellent."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband bought me this phone and I absolutely love it. I am still learning new features daily."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your looking for a good mid price range flagship phone, I highly recommend the s20 fe excellent phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfect case. It secures the phone front and back. Easy to take case off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is making me give up the flagship options. Affordable, great camera, decent battery life (and charges quickly, too), and has a great refresh rate (quicker than my iPhone 11 Pro)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is exactly what I needed . Lots of features and it lasts a long time"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente producto, comparado con mi S8 siento una gran renovación"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update on my phone. It stumped the ""rescue"" crew and Samsung (the phone worked great until the update at the end of June... then nothing). Samsung came through and replaced my brand new phone... now we see how this one does on the next update. I'm giving them a cautious three stars for doing the right thing.Well, guess what? The update fried my new phone... back to square zero... Samsung is back to one star. Patience..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I ever had. Flagship specs I got it on black Friday. Good price $549. Wait for a discount."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I RECEIVED THE CELLPHONE WITHOUT CHARGER. PLEASE SEND IT TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like this phone. It is fast, the screen is gorgeous and 120 hz makes scrolling smooth. It has most of the s20 flagship features but at a more reasonable price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great company to do business with! Real products and great customer service!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not ready for prime time yet. Has a lot of features but they don't work the way they should. Just traded it in for the S21 ulta 5g. This is the refined model. Works good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got the phone like brand new condition and was very happy to hold in my hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do research before buying this product. This phone has so many operating system problems that it is almost not functional."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Feels solid, scratch resistant, Comes with nice lanyard for phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I very like Samsung S series"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I don't like the fingerprint thing on the front and I don't like all the buttons on one side"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast, perfect, amazing camera and device overall. Exceptional value."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","See the above"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is very poor. The screen looks tired if you use it at night. And another thing is that the repair cost is too high. My friend spend $300 to repair its screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure why box was missing headsets."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got a great deal when I bought it. It's awesome. Features are great battery life is awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i like this phone so much.it is pretty worth its money.the screen is fantastic ,much better than my previous iphoneX"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing Samsung phone. More features than they advertised. Samsung gave up the house in this phone. The Camera is beyond bad a**."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I haven't had any issues with my phone. Love it, thank you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn't affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Shipped fast and works great! Good battery life and fast load."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is a little too big to handle but the One UI takes care of that, gives you a one-hand mode. Love love the cameras."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone!
A big step up from the galaxy s6!
Sound quality is good, photo quality is very good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am unable to get 5g forever so what's point getting a 5g phone!, as I found out nothing. could not even pick up 4g service with It, so mad after wasting time in Verizon store packed all the time and useless tech support, returned it. I will say it has the best camera in a phone ever seen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera works great and I love the color. Great speed even on 4g lite.
So far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Compré este teléfono para poder jugar Call of Duty Mobile. Estuve tentado a comprar otro terminal, diseñado específicamente para ese fin. Pero al final me decidí por el Samsung por su estilo que es bastante más refinado y porque, en papel, sus características eran similares. Un buen chip y una buena pantalla con alta taza de refresco. Lamentablemente el teléfono ha tenido algunas fallas. Al principio era software. Problemas con Google Play, con discord y ahora con la lectura de la sim card. Debo reiniciar el teléfono para que los servicios de llamadas, mensajería e Internet funcionen. Es una lástima. Además el software de reconocimiento facial y lectura de huella en pantalla es realmente malo.
Por último, la conectividad con accesorios de marcas distintas a Samsung es bastante malo. Tengo una wristband de Xiaomi y la conexión entre el teléfono y la banda y inestable. Debo estar abriendo la aplicación de mifit para que realice la descarga de información constantemente."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","phone works great so far and camera wins with the zoom... smooth transition from app to app and most videos r picture in picture so thats good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do not buy. Had the phone for 4 months sim card reader malfunctioned sent in for repair twice. sent back by Samsung the 2nd time unrepaired according to repair paperwork from Samsung. I now have a $700.00 paper weight."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone does not work on T- Mobiles 5G. Not sure about other carriers."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this for my parents to replace the old Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all, the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn't feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all, the display has worse color uniformity, you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken, the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The finger print and face identifiers are great but not 100% and of course masks don't help. Battery life seems to be great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone keeps on overheating and shutting down. Samsung customer service refuses to replace it. If you want a product with customer support, look elsehwere."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really liked the phone itself and would have loved to have kept it but the battery was absolutely terrible. I don't even know how they are allowed to sell this phone. The phone would die about mid day and that was with the power saving mode on and location off. The phone would also get very hot for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Easy to set up and works with Verizon.
Love it!
I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought it February 2022. Currently July 2022! Have to purchase a new phone because this phone is the biggest piece of garbage ever. Unlocked for 4 months. Now there’s nothing but problems with it. It currently works with Wi-Fi only. No service. Have had it looked at numerous times and they can’t do anything. Biggest lie ever. Do not purchase. If I could give it 0 stars I would."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had this phone for 2 months! I cannot use the camera anymore and I get ""Warning: Camera Failed""! I tried every trick and reset and nothing worked! I had Sumsung Tech connect to my phone and they couldn't fix it. Simply put Samsung knows there is an issue and are reluctant to make it public. I am a very light user and very knowledgeable user and based on all sites I found where users are posting the exact similar issue, I wish I knew before buying this worthless phone but will never buy another Samsung product again. This was quickly baked and released to the market to make $$$$. No accountability Samsung! None! Please release a fix immediately or offer to exchange these clunkers that are less than 3 months old! Before you buy just google Warning Camera Failed....100's of new owners posted the issue. I also posted on Samsung's community web site. And, Samsung never called me back after not being able to fix it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Returning my Samsung s20 FE 5g.
Maybe I just got lemon, but my phone got frozen screen 5,6 times in first two weeks and than reboots, not acceptable for new phone and 6gig ram. Also fingerprint reader is horrible, face unlock works good though.
Battery life not what expected for 4500mh.
Touchscreen is not always responsive, especially on the corners of the screen.
Thing that I liked is great display/resolution.
I would stay away from this phone, on paper everything seems amazing, in reality too many issues."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","NOT ONE.. NOT 2.. BUT 3rd SAMSUNG.. in a yr and half - thats gone DEFECTIVE!!! SAMSUNG IS CRAP!!! GARBAGE, PEOPLE!!! BUY ANYTHING... but a SAMSUNG!!!

(Would've thought I'd a learned from the first 2.. but NOOOOOO... I love PAIN!! How 'bout u? Love Pain? Then buy a SAMSUNG!!)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hi, the phone looked nice. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it would not work with spectrum mobile."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! Other than the ringtones, I haven't found anything that I dislike."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was very wary of purchasing a phone off of Amazon, but this is the real deal. Came in original box with charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works perfectly. Theres really no significant difference between this and one of the more expensive flagship versions of the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it great price. Got it on prime day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. My favorite features are the camera and fingerprint reader. I'm still exploring!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Gorgeous Color so glad I went with Cloud Orange its like a orange/pink color. Amazing camera too!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The day we rec'd this phone we took it to an AT&T store for the SIM card. The card would not fit. My daughter was so upset and this was her birthday gift so it upset me too. While all the features of this phone is what brought us to this phone I will say that all of her information transferred smoothly with the Samsung app, but without the SIM card working, we had no service. Phone had to be returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent smart phone. User friendly, functionable, stylish, right size."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this phone for my husband and then when it came we went to metro to turn the phone on.. but the problem is they put the card and everything and when you try to make a call it doesn't work it keeps saying no simcard he did everything to make the phone work but nothing happened.. it says its factory unlocked when i ordered.. so i returned it on 21st of last month and i just want a refund but still didn't got it it's been two weeks.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This unlocked phone has so many bugs! The touch screen is unresponsive 30% of the time. The phone will freeze for no apparent reason. The internet gets dropped no matter if you're on 5G, LTE, 4G, 3G or 2G.

Besides all that, if you want a sleek and slim phone case with a kickstand, we'll tie gonna have to wait because they don't exist. Only the big, bulky brick in your pocket case with kickstands exists at the moment.

Bottom line... This phone was put out on the market before everything was ready."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the big battery level"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had a battery malfunction or maybe its just how the phone is. But even without usage the battery get really hot and not holding the power for more then 5 hours even without usage and screen off. Amazon tryed all they could to get the product fix instead of return but i just dont want this phone anymore and amazon is taking it back already alset with amazon costumer service"

Very nice. Lots of memory space. Super fast😊❤"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Am hooked on Samsung phones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone wasn't good battery life is awful...my old phone battery is strong than it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't waste your money on this. Phone has had nothing but problems since I got it. Can't use gamepass, keeps asking for me to sign into Samsung account constantly, and refuses to recognize the sims card sometimes making it impossible to send calls or texts. All that money down the drain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When I took the clear plastic off of the front screen protector it had some dust on it and when I tried to clean it the finger print circle got some dust on it and I tried to fix it but that only made it worse. I think there should be something in the instructions that says whatever you do don't touch that spot. Now I have to send it back and my phone will be unprotected until the new case comes."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my new phone and it has fully met my expectations and was worth the wait."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a Galaxy user since the s3. This phone is awesome and I'm happy to have it."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone . Absolutely no complaints at Ll"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it. Would recommend for a good reasonably samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life could be better but honestly, this phone is a flagship for half the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I sold my s20 ultra and bought this. No issues so far everything works great. I now have extra money to buy something else."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone . Bought a 2nd one for my wife ."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone switched from an iphone and in my opinion this phone takes the win!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It says US version but it won't work on Att network after they shut down 3g. Att said it's not approved for thier network. Even though it work flawlessly before the 3g shutdown."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not the best phone but for the price is the best option."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast, large and stylish...a superb phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","120 has is amazing. The color is spectacularThe display is perfect. I don't like the selfish camera tho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","everything i need and more"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone worked well initially. Within about a month, however, touchscreen began to malfunction, leading to long periods of little or no functionality. The screen would become glitchy, become covered in static, and freeze. It would then take awhile for any form of functionality to return."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","A quality phone with good battery life, an excellent camera, and many polished features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loving my new battery life! Amazing camera and worth the price."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy bue dispositivo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Using a note 9, then got this s20FE for a work phone. So many features missing, can't deep press screen to wake up phone, there is no fingerprint scanner, face recognition doesn't work well. The camera is too low so when you install a screen protector its within a small circle that fills with dust very easily. The rear camera lense stick way out of the phone requiring you to buy a separate protector for the back. When a slim phone case is on its nearly flush with the rear lense/glass.There are a lot less options for cases, went with same brand of case and they didn't even give it a back stand either.This phone is one worth skipping over, definitely not worth more than $250..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent purchase. I’m in love of it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its really strong... the sensor works on the first try."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Keeps restarting and going in and out of service working"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All around, worst ot S series.....Been a consumer since S3. Went from Note 8 to a disfunctional S21+.S21 is terrible for phone reception....(5g)....drops calls when walking with wifi calling...dont trade in or replace a phone that works with one that doesnt. Btw, the camera is the only part that functions quite well....but not enough to overcome other issues"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It a great budget phone. You get more than wat you paid for."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","how should I connect headphones to this weird device? why there is no a regular slot for headphones and no adapter? i'm buying S20 FE in July 2022 because the next galaxy generation doesn't have a slot for external storage! this is degradation....what is going on?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Spend 500 and dont even recieve a charger, headphones or a tool to insert the sim? Absolutely disgusting. I could care less how the phone functions, the bare bones I recieved is nothing short of bs. Go to a store and buy a phone knowing you'll receive all the bells and whistles."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone everything seems perfect the battery could be a bit longer lasting."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I order a new phone and they sent me a used phone ,too hot to touch when charged, also full of virus too bad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is disappointing. The camera is the only good feature (which is truly awesome BTW). The phone has many glitches. It doesn't always stay connected to the WiFi in standby mode, it will just give me a blank screen sometimes and need to be restarted, and MMS sometimes won't go through without restarting the phone. These are the issues I've had in the first month. I've also even killed the battery a few days. I had decided to return it, but just missed the cut off. What a joke of a phone!This is my 5th or 6th Samsung Galaxy, and the 1st one that has not been worth it. I will not be purchasing another Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you're thinking about it just get it!! You won't regret it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm still learning how to use all the features with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","phone is discounted for price and quality.I have this phone almost for two months now, having a lot of issues on the screen.Never had fingerprint reading issues including old versions of galaxy phones. Screen is garbage.if you use drawing app you will see screen misses lots of touching points when you are drawing something. Also it registers lines which you didn't make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent value, would buy again!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's exactly what I was looking for!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","AHHHH nooo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone great price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about the phone is great for the most part. However, the phone has problems charging after I purchased a fast charging cable which oddly enough, isn't even listed on Amazon anymore. I plugged it in once and now the phone has problems charging even with the cable included with the phone. Very disappointing that I need to struggle just to get it to charge."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worth the price and works perfectly fine👍."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Diffentely worth the money and excellent phone to upgrade to highly recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It hasn’t even been a year, it says “ unable to send message message blocking is active” everytime I try to text or doesn’t allow incoming calls. I bought it for my aunt who is older & that is very dangerous."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Rapido"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Product came with stickers only on thr bottom side. On top of that, the stickers were slashed open. This brings me to believe that the phone itself was tampered in some way, or a used/refurbished product. This is quite upsetting, considering we were expected a completely new and unused product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved my phone just what I wanted ❤"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it a lot"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is garbage I don't even use it. Battery life was extremely limited. I thought there was Spyware in the phone because the battery drained so fast. It was glitch, slow, frozen, functioned like it was infected with a virus (and it was not). I had to factory reset it literally once a month and ended up only adding essential contacts, it still wouldn't work smoothly. I ended up digging out my old Note9 and use it. Even with its cracked body and age, it works a million times better! Do not buy this phone, you will regret it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Camera is great for price, runs games well. The stock software on this is a bit bloaty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","💘 it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Power button fell off and 5g not working like it was in the beginning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good and easy to use"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been buying Samsung phones for over 10 years. This one is terrible.... way too big...I jab be large hands and need 2 to hold it... will not fit in your pocket. Very heavy, battery lasts 1.5 days brand new out of the box. The camera that was raved about is only slightly better than my old s7."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","still setting up the phone ""my way"", but all seems really nice so far...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wonderful phone. I really like it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone of the year considering what it offers for the price."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not nearly enough packaging, I'm very surprised the phone made it here in 1 piece"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like the phone. HATE that Bixby is tied to the power button."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excalente calidad"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung hasn't let me down."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Unstable data connection with Tmobile!5G barely works in Chicago.I have a a52 5g as a second phone, and it gets way better data connection!Other than that, it's perfectly fine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Seriously no charger? My old phone did not have a fast charging adapter. It takes 4 hours to charge this phone on that. I thought this was a premium phone? Now I have to pay more for a fast charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this phone is not good. I definitely should have spent the extra money for the regular s20 or waited for the s21. the phone is slow, it glitches all the time. the camera is terrible and freezes and shuts down a lot. my last phone was the galaxy s8 and i feel like this phone is a bit of a down grade from that one... don't buy it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No me agrado que alla llegado incompleto le falto Handset + Cling"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone was just as described!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this 5g phone. Super fast and easy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung has put in apps that I am unable to remove and they are difficult to turn off. It seems Samsung is insistent on collecting all my data!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is no good, no charger , no headphones jack, it brings a useless type c cord."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As described...the phone is like new condition"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone all of a sudden stopped recognizing the sim that was in my phone after working perfectly fine for 8 months. You can't get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it. I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired. Dealing with Samsung supports has been awful. I also purchased the 2 year protection plan that's a joke because they wont help till the manufacture warranty is expired. what a night mare. HEY SELLER get the the IMEI numbers on the invoice/receipt so we can get the device fixed if it breaks for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This product is NOT new. It is refurbished. Serial Number begins with RF and IMEI SV is 26. I bought this under the impression that it is factory unlocked and brand new. It feels awful being misled. I cannot even return it because it is past the return date."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Works great! As expected!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything works as it should. Fast delivery."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I thought that the phone was pretty poggers."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really a great phone! Love it!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone, excellent battery life, very fast and easy to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really liked this phone at first. It was somewhat too large but had lots of very nice features. Then, after owning it 3-weeks, bad things started to happen. During calls the screen would keep going dark after 10-sec. I contacted Samsung and the tech could do nothing to fix this issue. He said they were working on it and needed to re-included an app that they removed but had no alternative. Then, the answer and hang-up buttons stopped working completely and the phone wouldn't shut off. Finally I had enough of this not-ready-for primetime piece of nonsense made by Samsung - a company that I had always respected. Fortunately I was able to return the phone through Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Android phones use to be easy to use and navigate, this has way to much samsung proprietary software that is not at all intuitive. No back button, u have to swipe. Complicated for no reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was locked when it said it was unlocked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Item is being sold as new but is used and abused."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy buen telefono"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone! Fingerprint reader better than expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was missing in the box."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am So angry when I received the phone, USB C input on the phone was already worn down to the point where I had a wiggle my charger in to get it righto get it right and the battery life never lasted more than 5 to 6 hours.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We like it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Interesting device, simple design, good camera especially in good lighting conditions, but battery life is not good enough ..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best value with flagship specs. Absolutely in love with this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bluetooth don't work will not sync. Voice command is retarded, it will some times make the correct words and then re-change them to something stupid. ALSO will will Stop recording in mid sentence, after about two seconds. MAJOR REGRET buying this phone. Very little i like about this phone so far.. my old phone was great (Not Samsung)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Value for money"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm loving this cell! Sharp, clear, and precise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had to upgrade my phone when AT&T went to the 5g network. I purchased this phone for $600.This phone has been shorted in every feature: camera quality, device connectivity, security features (face recognition and fingerprint recognition), sound quality, and charging time when you don't use their special cables. The phone is slower than my previous phone.I will return this phone and try and different Samsung or go to Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very good!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cheap plastic backing, HORRIBLE 407 ppi, UGLY reds, poor screen quality overall, no headphone jack, downgraded power supply (used to be glossy with nice, visible grey lettering), no headphones included, sluggish fingerprint reader, and genuinely the most DISGUSTINGLY cheap Samsung galaxy S series phone I've ever had! Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything, without calling the downgrades out! I've never been so disappointed in a product. What a nasty joke of a Samsung S series. This is NOT a quality phone in any aspect that counts. I hate it. I do not reccomend buying this. Coming from the S9, this is a MAJOR downgrade and I'm furious about it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone ever!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has a good camera"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great at first but in less than 3 months started having issues with the phone not working properly. The issues have NOT been resolved and the phone has not been replaced. Very unsatisfied customer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super bummed that it wasn't a new phone. It does look to be in good condition. Seems to work, but didnt come with a charger or any cables."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone. Learning so much"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone today and as soon as I got the phone, I install the Touch Screen test application from play store to check the touch screen issue. I can clearly notice that this model of samsung have ghost touch issue. I really liked the phone and it could be a flagship killer phone. But, due to this issue I have to return this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","USB charging only work intermittently if the plug is in just right. Power button stopped working after a year. Phone wasn't abused and always in a protective case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The best phone of 2020."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I loveeeee my phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery does not last a full day. Less than 12 hours. When using an app the phone will close and move to a different app by itself. GPS navigation beginning to give problems of shutting down begore reaching your destination. Not pleased with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone worked well for a couple hours. Then started getting message that wireless charging paused. Would wait for charger, Samsung model, to stop blinking red. Would try again. Maybe one time in four it would work. Took the case off and had the exact same behavior. Tried my old phone and it worked 100% of tries, so returned S20 FE 5G."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's nice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am very disappointed that I received a new S 20 galaxy that was defective. My husband told me that I sound garble when I called him. I was sure it was his phone not mine as mine was brand new. After a few weeks of people stating they had trouble hearing me I realized it was my new S 20. I just want it replace. Not have it repaired. It was defective so just replace it. I was defective from day one do the right thing and replace it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is not impressive in anyway. Touch screen is horrible, the battery life is the worst I've ever had. Lack of a headphone jack still pisses me off as well.100% wish I did not buy. Usually keep phones for 3-4 years. This one wont even last a year I know it already."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone hoping that it would be a good phone also for the certified qpad fast charger. Didn't not work work the charger. Phone kept getting hot even when I was not on the phone more than 10 mins. Stopped charging and took 3 hrs to charge. Liked the phone very much hated it had so much wrong with it for the expensive price it is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it kinda"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very nice experience as of nowq"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Dislike the fact that despite being newer and having w better battery, this underperforms compared to the note 9. Firmware issues causinf rapid battery drain and wifi connectivity issues... returning phone as it overheats to the point of scalding the user."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","its a great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just got this phone 3 months ago and it fell put of my pocket (2ft. At most) and my screen completely shattered. As you can see from the pictures, my case took no damage. I called Samsung and they had no answer when I asked them about their ""indestructible gorilla glass"". It would have cost me $265 to replace my screen. So now I am out the $599 it cost me for this phone and now another $399 to replace the entire phone. Honestly, for as poor of quality as Samsung is putting out there now I think my next phone will be with Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente celular"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked everything"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La batería dura solo cerca de 8 horas. Lo tuve solo un día, y al día siguiente lo envíe de regreso. El problema es que el reembolso tarda hasta un mes en llegar"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Total piece of crap waste of money. Half the time I can't hear people on the phone. It freezes, touch screen doesn't work properly. It's as if this phone was released way too soon before it was ready. It was a pretty inexpensive galaxy tho so I thought why not. Now, I know why not. BTW the camera on S8 has better looking photos.My husband is watching my struggles with this phone and he's using it as an opportunity to say ""see, I told you you should've gone with an iphone"". As an android loyalist, this is extremely disappointing and infuriating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Simply amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Spigen makes good stuff"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone about a week ago and it's been frustrating to say the least. The fingerprint sensor is very hit or miss, mostly miss. I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased this online since it was a little cheaper than going into tmobile- its awful. I've had nothing but problems with it. It freezes, won't let me make phone calls, tells me randomly I don't have a Sim card, and nothing seems to work properly. Not worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like it overall"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everyday use"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is simply great!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is a joke! And that is a fan edition, which fan want that short length of battery? Just buy something else."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought one from best buy with hardware version 1.0 and an another with hardware version 1.1. Bought a 3rd one from amazon and I have to save all three units have the same issue.Pros-Battery life-Snapdragon 865-Size-WeightCons- Touch screen issues. Even after three firmware updates, samsung can't seem to fix the problem.- Black crush issue. This is visible on all 3 of my units. Ended up returning all 3.- Android auto and bluetooth constantly disconnect. Tried samsung, oneplus, xiaomi, and lg cables and all seem to disconnect. I never had android auto or bluetooth disconnect on my older android devices."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery has lost 22% power in less than 2 hours with during set up.. My 3-years old phone lost 5% in the same time. I will see how it looks by morning time. I might hav e to send to back for an exchange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Noticed right of hand when power one that it didn't say Samsung galaxy s21 all it showed was Samsung galaxy and then after trying to use it was slow an kinda glitches and the battery life sucked I sent it back for refund still waiting on my refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not last long. Waste 500 dollars just for 3 months and functional damage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone stopped working No service need refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is really quite simple. After 4 months of using the phone, folks at the other side cannot hear me. I looked up the problem online and found others with the same issue. From the least destructive option to the most I went through the recommendations. Ultimately I had to go nuclear back to factory reset. That worked for about 6 weeks. And it is happening again. Run AWAY from this cell phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very short battery life compared to my old s9+. My old phone also had better features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Do not buy red phone if you have tmobile or sprint it is not compatible! Even though it is in the description that it works with them we went to 3 different tmobile locations and had the issue escalated to find out that the entire line of the red phone are not compatible. I submitted my refund and they recieved the item on July 2 its now July 14 and I have yet to get my money back. No response when I sent a message to them either."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Why did this advertise, from Samsung, that it came with an S Pen when in fact, it did not!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It works, but I definitely won't be getting a Samsung phone again. This phone has a lot of small little quirks that break the Android experience for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the worse phone I have ever owned. 😫 many great features. The one thing you rely want it for is for communication. This phone will not let me have conversations for over 5 minutes on some occasions I've gotten 10 minutes. When it started cutting me off is was not often but now I can not keep any conversation without being cut off. Frankly face recognition or fingerprint mean nothing if you can't use the phone for its primary purpose. For $600 I'm extremely disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone didn't work with my wireless company.Put back in box shipped back in perfect condition and Amazon charged me a $110 restocking fee .Be careful ordering from Amazon .It's a shame such a big company steals from customers"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","One of the main reasons I bought this phone was for the dual sim function. It is a lie the phone is NOT dual sim. Waste of money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no one could hear me talk when making phone callstook forever to load anythinghad to press whatever button you were wanting multiple times for it to finally take and then start to load."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Problemas con el conector de la carga"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is supposed to be NEW!!! As you can see in the photos, when I opened the box it was dusty inside and you can't see but there's a fingerprint on the screen. Also, you can see a sim card was activated on March 8th and I received the phone on April 4th. Also, whomever had it before had 50 pages open on the internet. I do believe I need to be compensated for getting a USED phone when it was clearly advertised as NEW!!!! I'm considering sending it back! PISSED OFF!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is sub par for this expensive phone. Chatted with Amazon rep and did nothing to help me. I hate to return it and go through the process again. I hate when things are junk."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The reviews say this phone will work with Xfinity mobile. Not true, I spent over an hour with Xfinity rep, and they found out the only S20 that will work, are ones they sell. No other unlocked Samsung S20 phones will work with them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone came brand new and don't turn on"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La batería del teléfono se desgastaba rapidamente aún cuando no estaba usando aplicaciones. Probablemente estaba defectuosa, pero para ser un teléfono ""nuevo"" no es aceptable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Two tech from amazon try to help but with no good results plus I bought insurance and a case had to return it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Verizon educated me on this phone. Said it did not support the two faster levels of 5G. Had to send it back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loved it at first but then a line randomly shows up spanning the length of the display and refuses to go away. So.etimes it's pink. Sometimes it's green. Either way it is completely unacceptable and ruins the whole thing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's not a dual Sim phone. It's one Sim and a memory card"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We ordered 2 phones cleared locked when it said in the description that they were unlocked.I spent 2 hours trying to get them to work before calling my carrier to find out they were locked. Amazon lied! We are buying less and less from them because of issues we've had. I called customer service only to get a rep I could barely understand because of the language barrier. When I said I can't understand you she hung up on me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Honestly, I've never had a new phone act up this much after just a couple of months. It's constantly freezing and the system itself keeps ""not responding."" I should have spent the extra $200 for the regular S20."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything I connect it to wi-fi it drop my phone out of wi-fi. I spoke with AT&T, they said the phone is defective. $600 went to the garbage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was so excited to get this phone on Amazon prime day and it has turned out to be the worst phone ever!! I loved the fact the volume is so loud, however it cuts out daily on speaker and just cuts out in general. I am so sorry I bought this phone and unfortunately couldn't return it within the return window because I was sick with Covid and covid pneumonia. Don't waste your money!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Got the phone, couldn't make phone calls. Said it was unlocked but AT&T stated it would never work on their network. Returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ridiculous!!! I would not have bought this phone if I were aware that the memory isn't expandable like every other Samsung I've ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone has mind of its own. Closes apps while using them. Have call apps to identify and block private numbers no matter the app or membership type it doesn't not do what it should. Battery life drains very fast. Tells me my passwords and thumbprint don't match . Key board does what it wants. Example: if I type cat, the keyboard will do this caaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I type correct spelling and it autocorrects to sjsksbejdjsksns. So disappointed I'm thinking of switching to apple"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Only works half the time"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My husband had his old Samsung Phone for five years no cracks or scratches in the glass. Two days with this one and the screen is shattered from one two foot drop. Definitely buy a case this one has zero durability."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This product came without charger"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung and the US corporate overlords (Verizon, AT&T, T-mobile, etc) have chosen to prevent us from using this phone’s second SIM card slot. Evil… DON’T BE EVIL!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is great, so far. Finger recognition is hit or miss, often taking several tries before the phone will come to life. Bluetooth connectivity dropped more than my old phone did, for the first few months I owned the phone. Keystrokes are misleads a lot more than my older S5 and Moto X4 phones from 2015 and 2018.I've tried two different screen protectors. No improvement"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the phone itself. It's snappy and seems to work well (although the fingerprint reader is a little weak). My main complaint is the screen is far too brittle. I bought an s20 fe for both my wife and I and her screen has cracked once, been replaced, cracked again and mine has cracked as well. Both have been in cases with screen protectors and not been subject to abuse. Never had this problem with other phones. Sad because other wise is a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone was defective. Worked with the techs at my cell service carrier for 2 hours before we determined it was just not going to work."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Many things I did like about the phone but I had more dislike so I returned the cell phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No finger print sensor or anything that makes this phone special. I felt the camera was average as well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","this is the slowest phone I have ever had, it is constantly searching for a connection, or loading pages total piece of crap, picture and camera are average not worth the time setting up or buying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All was fine when i got it. Setup was easy. After 3 days or so though the screen went black and stopped working. I'm having to return it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Within the first 5 hours it shut off multiple times and the screen kept freezing. Ended up returning the phone. Your best bet is to go straight to your phone provider."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen is good, not bright enough, battery need to last longer. How do get my refund is the biggest issue with this device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this S20 FE 5G not seeing the fine print which stated all S20 models came with headphones (and a headphone jack) Except for the S20 FE. When the phone arrived I sent it back unopened."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Doesn't work properly. Phone blacks out and Amazon would not accept a return because return window recently closed. EF Amazon and the horrible supervisor that took this call."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Received refurbished phone instead of new. Definitely doesn’t work transferring from sprint to T-Mobile. Definitely a pain in the butt. Went out of town so missed the return window. Rip off"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sólo funcionó 30 días. Diagnóstico Centro autorizado Samgsung - Tarjeta Lógica DAÑADA. ERROR DE FÁBRICA. Ahora debo pagar pagar para devolverlo y que puedan solventar un problema que no es mío."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It has a mind of its own. It glitches on from sleep mode and turns the screen face on and off repeatedly over and over and over. Nothing makes it stop until it stops on its own. Super irritating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your looking for a phone with a great camera,,,THIS AIN'T IT.Go for a Samsung 10 .Otherwise it's your basic cell phone ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Haven't even had the phone for a month yet. Love it. Unfortunately, without even doing anything to it the screen developed a hair line crack across it. Really annoyed and I've been a Samsung user forever. I haven't even dropped the phone yet and it's doing this. Very bad quality. Going to try to return it. I'm assuming this thing is defective. Will update once it is replaced with a different phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was great for the first 6 months but now it randomly won't charge saying it has moisture in the place where the charger connects. It's not been near any moisture and a professional looked at it under a microscope and couldn't find anything wrong. Really sucks because it cost a lot of money and it can't be returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Found out my phone also has the touch screen issue others are complaining about. Tested it with Touch Screen Test app, instruction is on Youtube. Two finger swipe causes criss-cross pattern. Jittery and unresponsive swipe action when scrolling through websites. If software issue it can eventually be fixed, but not going to wait around to find out that it's a hardware issue. Returning the phone after one hour of use. Guess Samsung cut a critical corner while trying to reduce the cost of the FE version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is terrible. The screen randomly goes black all the time, in all applications. Happens during texting, in email, search engines, social media apps, games. I will be returning it as soon as I can figure out which one to replace it with. Also, every time the black screen flashes it does a hit on the battery life. Have lost nearly 60% battery power in six hours, and I've had this phone less than two weeks. It was new in the box when purchased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone was in new condition and works great but the description says it's unlocked and the one I received only works on Tmobile. The best part is I used a payment service since it cost me around 700 and I can't get that money back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a bad phone.screen response time, launcher and functionality is very irritating.Some people want a sleek, responsive and UI that is intuitive. This phone has none of these essential qualities.When I refresh this phone again, I will never look at Samsung.please look elsewhere and save yourself buyer's remorse."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","An obvious money grab. I won't comment on the phone as it has to be charged and without a charger or usb compatable cord that can't happen until I get one. <explitives deleted>"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Received with broken screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really love the phone so far! It is pretty nice. The feedback it gives when you type. It is great.The biggest biggest biggest issue is that the OS is bugged. You can not leverage hybrid SIM it just won't allow it.SIM 1 if occupied prevents SIM 2 from identifying its presence. If SIM 1 is unoccupied SIM 2 works. This is not how it is supposed to work. It is likely the phone needs a firmware fix.I hope Samsung can address this big Oops."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Friends and family call me, phone only rings occasionally. Drops calls all the time. Search Google, phone locks up. Very slow. I am using WIFI and WIFI calling with strong WIFI signal. Same thing happens on cell service. Did I get a Lemon phone? It's been over 30 days so How do I get my money back??"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It didn't work fresh out of the box. Getting refund from Amazon. Hopefully"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Screen touch ridiculous. I try Swype or direct touch in messenger or Google search and it skips and is intelligible.. Takes forever to charge . Had Samsungs forever and this is a piece of crap."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When a friend told me they got it for 399.00 I just shook my head."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bad buy...doesn't work;too slow and lot of trouble with the internet connection. Not reccomend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","COMPRE EL CELULAR PERO LO LLEVE A DAR DE ALTA Y ME DICEN QUE NO ESTA DESBLOQUEADO QUE PUEDO HACER???????? ME DICEN QUE DE QUE COMPANIA LO COMPRE"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It doesn't include earphones and if you try to connect some wire earphones via usb c to 3.5 mm jack it says device not supported"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was not able to use my AT&T sim card for this phone. The technician said it's not compatible. It's only compatible with T Mobile and Verizon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The second SIM slot is not working. I have to send it back. I bought 2 phone and both of them with the same issue..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","You would think for paying over 600.00 for a phone they could at least put a protective case on the damn thing. I didn't even have it 1 day andropped it in the sand from only 2 feet up and the entire front of the phone shattered and busted the glass and the phone went dead. WTF?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Deceptive description. This item came with a plain box looks like a refurbish item. This was not what was on the description of the item I bought. I intend to return this item but it says I cannot return this. I am extremely upset. Beware of this vendor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Reducieron el precio un par de dias despues a la compra que realicé. Debería obtener un bono por lo menos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Horrible experience with this phone and trying to get support. Keyboarf just stopped doing prrdictive text and spell check"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Does not read sim card. I got the same phone from my cell provider and it works great and read the sim perfectly. Just pay a few dollars more and get one that works. NOT THIS ONE.2/6/21 UPDATE: I sent this phone back 2 months ago and STILL HAVE NO REFUND. I have contacted the seller and amazon with not even so much as a response back. Buyer beware!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is NOT unlocked !!!! I bought it for a present and now my friend is having an AWFUL time trying to unlocked !! I hate hate thisI will never ever buy a Samsung againAmazon let me down so bad !!!’"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had Droid phones for years and had solid connection at my house. This phone with Verizon wouldn't connect at all. Moving to T-mobile has helped a little but still lots of voice drop outs and dropped calls. Putting Verizon Sim back into old Droid is rock solid connection."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I returned this phone. I didn't realize it didn't have Advanced Messaging on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Product does not work well. It’s been about 2 months and the phone gets really hot easily, constantly freezes, and MANY other malfunctions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No receipt. Phone box had been previously opened the seal was broken the instruction papers all undone out of box. Fingerprints on phone where someone had taken cellophane off previously. Thought I was purchasing a new phone that I could get a manufactures warranty, but you have to have a receipt and a new product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Typing correction is horrible. also multiple buttons to push to get to one place."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My phone will not charge at times. I think I would like to return it for the same phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","struggled trying to take out the sim card holder. once i put in my verizon card, it did not work. then i had a heck of the time retrieving the sim card so that the phone can be returned. data transfer from note 8 was easy. other than that it is incompatible with verizon carrier. its more than disapointing considering my business is built on prompt response."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It is ""MADE IN VIETNAM"" and ""Box printed in Mexico"". Once I opened the box, first thing I draw my attention is the ""paper dust"" inside. I rechecked the box sealing, looks like it is well sealed, but dust come in from which step? How Samsung handles the product line?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No charging cable/block. please mail me a charging cable and a charging block asap"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything was great until the third day when I couldn’t make any phone calls. I could hear people on the phone, but they could not hear me talk. They wanted me to factory reset the phone every time this happened which was three times in one day."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked the large screen. But there is only one problem. It cannot be activated! I have spent a lot of money on different sim cards including t-mobile, Verizon, straight talk even tracfone and nothing. SO BUYER BE WHERE!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone won't connect to my service. Constantly drops calls."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it just doesnt fit right. especially where the power and volume buttons are"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Really a $600 phone does not include a charger or a USB cord! Very poorly done!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No what I thought"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My cell phone provider would not activate because it was made in Vietnam. Had to return."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Same as the other reviews, 2nd sim card does not work at all. This is a completely stupid setting!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Una semana despues de utilizar el telefono, la bateria no carga. Voy a proceder a la devolución :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","it was missing items and the battery doesn't hold charge"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this because it said it's dual sim , but the second sim is not detected at all. I tried same sim card in both slots only primary sim slot works. Horrible...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This isn't unlocked and if you go to buy a sim it will read that you can't have service with this phone. I went to Verizon and they said they can't help me ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If your phone fails due to a manufacturing fault, expect to pay out of pocket as samsung will charge you for repair regardless of if there is any physical damage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone has great specs, but is essentially useless because it won't read the sim card. I've done some research on this and it seems this is a persistent problem with this phone. Do not buy this phone until this bug is publicly acknowledged and fixed by Samsung. I will be returning this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't buy it if you want a dual sim phone!!I bought it on Amazon since I saw it supports dual sim in customer questions. Turns out it doesn't work and wastes a whole day of mine to figure it out. Maybe the esim will work but I don't want to spend more time on this.It's a good product, but Amazon makes it hard to enjoy it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 It does not work. It is a bad phone for the cost. the display fails and it is a general failure. also when returning it, amazon charges you 100 dollars to accept the return even though they sent a useless product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE"," It does not work. It is a bad phone for the cost. the display fails and it is a general failure. also when returning it, amazon charges you 100 dollars to accept the return even though they sent a useless product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If I can give this product is zero review I I would but I can’t I just can’t explain how bad of a quality this product is just don’t get it please it’s not worth the money don’t waste your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","In the description indicated that the phone support dual sim, but it doesn't."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Too much of a hastle to get a phone from Amazon. Shown as unlocked but when the carrier tried to install their software, they were unable as the phone was LOCKED."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like other reviewers have mentioned this thing has touch issues. I can be randomly scrolling on Reddit when the phone does something else randomly. I'm started the return on this , hopefully Samsung can fix the problem for there. i bought this in nov, or dec 2020 and got my refund"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not working money back"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Refurbished ripoff. Says new and is not. The screen cover to peel off is for an iphone, missing the phone key for the sim slot. Came out of box dusty. Not unlocked. Complete scam and now I have to wait to get my money back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","We bought this phone and took it into US Cellular and they said it is NOT compatible with their network. Very disappointed, don't know if I should be upset with US Cellular or Samsung. Unsure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I will never buy this phone again... sucks. The srceen cracks way to easy.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Getting someone else's order replies from Oral-B purchase on same day I activated the phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Extremely disappointed— phone arrived locked and will not work with sim. Popped the same SIM card into another phone and it worked flawlessly. Do not buy."

calls with headphones are terrible and echo-y.
i havent had it long enough to discover new problems"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Never again will I buy another Samsung phone. My Galaxy S8+ is superior in every way except 5G. This phone reeks internal design contest by 1st year interns. Goodbye Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Un tamaño ideal y está nuevo sin rasguños o daños"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is NOT unlocked and ear buds missing! Cannot connect to mobile network; such a waste of money!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The sceen went out exactly 2 months after it was delivered. I've tried rebooting it, that does not work. This is terrible."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Same as above."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Would not recommend the small back camera glass is cracked. Only had phone for 1 day...apparently it either came cracked or It cracked by gently applying the glass protector I bought for this very reasion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I feel pretty lied to since it said it was unlocked to all carries, but when I put my virgin mobile/boost disk into it, it said it wasn't supported so it doesn't support everyone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was a knock off from wish, the GPS didn't work, it was a scam"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I ordered this phone and had high hopes that it would be what I had hoped for. This phone's screen on numerous occasions has stopped working or would randomly open apps when trying to scroll. This phone is very disappointing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This product is advertised as being unlocked. I recieved a locked phone that cannot be activated with my carrier. Very disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm so disappointed I got a buggy phone, its like I got a refurbished one. Google closes on its own, and some apps do not work right, which works fine on my 5 year old phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Touch screen cannot be zoomed, over heats and does not fast charge while on wireless charging. I had a S9+ Before this after buying this I felt like I downgraded instead of upgrading."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone was locked tied to another # and still owed payments on it. The Verizon Store said it was probably stolen.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have a Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G phone. I have been getting a burning sensation on my hands and fingers when using the phone, and I have a protective cover. Even if I use the phone for short calls, my hands feel irritated for quite a while after I stop using the phone. I wonder if others are experiencing this problem."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","samsung does not stand behind their products. had my new phone 6 days before a crack appeared on the screen with no damage done to the phone then i got 3 hours of being in a transfer loop. bought with samsung care but that is useless when the nearest repair place is an hour away and cancels appointments last minute. like the phone well enough. i will likely look into a different company when it's time to upgrade again."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I would love to give a positive review ... no sim card , I cannot use my new phone. So all negative."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Wife has been complaining about cost of Verizon for over a year... so after checking reviews I bought her this UNLOCKED phone and a Mint Mobile SIM

This Samsung does everything she wants, for $20 per month instead of $75 at Verizon

I even doubled the standard 128Gig of memory by buying a 128Gig MicroSD to go in the 2 sided option tray (one side for SIM and other side for MicroSD)

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this cell several months ago direct from Samsung, but I can't find any other place to do a review, so I'm doing it here. (Long-time Amazon customer) This phone is very glitchy. For example, the Bluetooth will not connect to my Toyota Camry properly. It stays in airplane mode. Even once connected (took 5 tries of disconnecting and reconnecting), once the car is turned off, the phone drops back into airplane mode. My prior Galaxy did not have this problem. Also, when connected to Spotify, there are small blanks in the music, where the phone drops the sound for a second, then starts up again. Also, when you tap an icon on the home page, sometimes the app does not open, but the home page shifts from page 1 to page 2. This happens often. Finally, the phone has a lot of installed apps which serve no purpose, but cannot be uninstalled. All in all, not a great phone!"

So far I have nothing nice to say about this phone!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Let’s go over the basic specs:
- Snapdragon 865 CPU
- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM
- Wifi 6
- 5G
- 6.5 inch AMOLED display
- Under-Display fingerprint sensor
- 4500 MAH battery
- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.
Pros:
- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesn’t perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.
- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.
- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isn’t stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I don’t mind One UI’s more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.
- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhone’s will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.

Cons:
- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldn’t stand the drop.
- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I can’t stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.
- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isn’t any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isn’t great. You can register a face, but it isn’t reliable in any sense and it just doesn’t hold the bar.
Odds and Ends:
- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I haven’t had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals
- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it won’t unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.

Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsung’s 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No sirve se descarga rápido y es lento"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the phone I PURCHSED is not compatible with GLOBAL SYSTEM NETWORK"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Beautiful display, fast connection but poor battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros: Very quick and lots of memory, great hardware.
Cons: Samsung apps instead of Google apps on an Android device, no visual voicemail, lost all contacts added or updated during time using this phone because Samsung is trying to take over all your data. Also, with phone securely encased in a protective cover since day one, after only three months of use the covered edges around phone looked horrible - trading it in I thought it would be in near perfect condition.

Summary - Traded this phone in after three months due to losing visual voicemail, then realized it wasn’t backing up my contacts to google as it was setup to do … Samsung wants all your data … probably my last Samsung phone due to all the Samsung apps you cannot remove. Not happy about Samsung causing my first contacts data loss in decades."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm an avid Samsung fan or should I say I used to be. I've used numerous Samsung products ranging from TVs, laptops, tablets, cellphones, monitors, PC parts, ear buds, speakers, fridges and etc.

My experience with this phone changed everything. I bought this in April 2022. I thought it was time to upgrade my S10. For a few months it worked great and all of sudden it would randomly rebooted itself.
It was just a few times a day at first and it was annoying but did not bother me enough to have it checked.
then it got worse and worse. It would freeze and reboot itself randomly more than 10 times a day. sometimes during web browsing sometimes using various apps or sometimes even during texting.
I did the factory reset hoping that would fix the issue. but It didn't work.
I finally made an appointment online and visited a local third party repair shop authorized by Samsung.
They ran a hardware test and told me that they couldn't find anything wrong hardwarewise. and that I'd have to contact Samsung and mail it in for further inspection.

I contacted Samsung and the technician told me that it would take 5 business days to inspect and fix. They refused to send in a temporary phone because their customers in the past didn't return loaner phones so they stopped providing ones. So I had to live without my phone for a week.

A week later, Samsung sent me back my phone and all they did was a software update. Ridiculous. I could've done it myself in 5 minutes.
of course it did not fix the issue at all. My phone would still reboot for no reason many times a day.
even simple web browsing was sometimes impossible cuz it would freeze and reboot.
I contacted the service center and they told me to mail in my cellphone again. Which means I would have to live without my phone for another week. Unacceptable. I asked them if I could pull up the log report from my cellphone and email them so they can verify the issue. (you can do it by typing *#9900# and choose Run dumpstate/logcat). I even recorded a video of my cellphone rebooting itself repeatedly.
They said no so I asked the technician that I'd like to talk to his supervisor. The manager repeated the same thing and told me I'd still have to mail in my cellphone or to my surprise, he tried to sell me a new phone. he said I could trade in the phone and buy a new one. He even told me that he could give me an ""extra discount"".
He gave me his quote($ 300 for the trade in value + $ 150 discount )and while him on the line, I went to the Samsung website to check how much cheaper his deal was compared to the one on the website. Guess what? no difference at all. not even a cent. I was really upset and asked him where his ""extra discount was"" and he told me he was sorry that I was confused lol.

I lost my temper and yelled at him. he apologized if his offer sounded misleading.
I'm sure there are many people who are happy with this phone without having any issues.
but keep in mind that unless you have a crack or noticeable hardware damage on your phone, forget about Samsung ever honoring the warranty and fix your phone properly.
and don't forget that you won't have your phone for a week only to get it back with the same issues.

This whole thing left bitterness in my mouth and lost faith in Samsung. I am still mailing it in to Samsung honestly I don't think they will fix it. I will navigate my option and buy a new phone either an iPhone or Pixel. but it won't be a Samsung for sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Our carrier is Consumer Cellular and we usually purchase phones through them. However on Cyber Monday Amazon was running such a great deal on these phones ($399!) we bought 2 of them. Well despite putting our Consumer Cellular Sim cards in these phones we could not get cell service. We called Consumer Cellular twice, Amazon product services, and Samsung's helpline. None of these could get our phones to work. The only thing we could conclude is that these phones came locked. And since Amazon sold out of that exact phone they would not replace it. So sadly we had to send them back for a refund. We were very disappointed!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone, don't like being forced to use a password or anything to unlock the phone everything I try to use it. The Galaxy 10 plus was not like this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phones are fine, but the company is dishonest and won't honor their own trade in policies."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Coming from Pixel 3a, S20 FE does feel like an upgrade. It's not mind-blowing, but I can see myself using this phone for quite some time before the next flagship. One big reason for the upgrade was 5G. To be honest, I can't quite tell the difference between 5G vs 4G LTE that I've been using... Still, I don't regret my purchase and going to keep using S20 FE.

Pros:
+ Look of the back: I really like the orange color and the matted texture. I really do. It just fits me.
+ 120 Hz screen speed: it makes for a smoother scrolling when I'm reading the news or e-mail. However, it does eat up battery life
+ Camera zoom: The range is 0.5x - 30x, which is more than what was possible in 3a.
+ 128GB internal storage: plenty for me, a regular phone user to take pics and videos. There's an option to use a microSD, too, for additional storage.
*Side bar: this is a useful feature of Samsung phones. A shortcut. Makes it easier to keep my screen looking clean and organized.
*Spotify 6-mo Premium: I bought the phone from Samsung directly and it came with Spotify for 6 months.
*Samsung Smart Switch App: made it easy to port data from 3a to FE.
*Water-resistant: for Pacific Northwest, this is a must...

So-so:
*Camera: The camera features other bells and whistles like slow mo, hyperlapse, super slow-mo, and even food mode for social media. The camera is catered to social media for sure. FE has night vision, but tbh, 3a had better night vision mode. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.
* Battery life: 3a had better battery, but play with the power mode, this phone can last a while. With heavy use, this phone will die on you fast on High Performance or Optimized. Can last you a day under medium power or light use. I had this phone go without a charge on a weekend camping trip, and was able to make it last by placing it on maximum power saving. Based on usage, the battery can last, just not past a day...
*Screen (videos and pictures): it looks great. Colors do look a bit saturated when I took pictures with it. There are options to change to a more natural look, but default is the saturated look. Youtube, Netflix... Streaming is fine.

Cons:
* Bloatware and features: Coming from Google Pixel 3a, this phone comes with a lot of features right off the bat. Samsung proprietary apps do feel like bloatware, but not all of them are throwaways. Few are useful.
* Screen (responsiveness): it falls short. Randomly, the screen becomes unresponsive to where my finger is. That makes it hard to unlock my phone. The phone becomes frustrating at random times because I can't unlock the phone or open an app.
*Updates: no Android 11 yet...
*Size: ... it's big. It feels more like a tablet than a phone in my hands after a while. There is a one-handed mode, but ... the physical size is still big. At least, with such a mode, I don't have to stretch my thumb or fingers for too long. It's annoying though.

Despite the shortcomings, for some reason, FE fits and gels with my needs for a phone. I can see myself using for 3 - 5 years. Even with S21 coming out, I think I'll stick with FE for a while until the next upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've only had this phone for a month. I've not used it enough or downloaded much to be getting the ""not enough internal storage"" message. Battery life stinks too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is a fantastic phone. I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.
Positives (in no particular order):
1) Excellent camera. It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief. Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it. I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image. I've never had that on a cell phone. The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good. Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees. This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera. It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.
2) Thermal throttling. Yes, this is actually an advantage. The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter. Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.
3) Battery life. I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.
4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse. Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio. Very few reviewers will cover this.
5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.
6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that. The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.
This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:
1) Weak haptic motor. Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.
2) People mention lack of glass back. I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.
3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people. Many compare it to the Pixel 6. Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many. In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6. A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal. So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison. That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.
4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot. This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't know yet to new
I read all of these comments the phone did not come out until January12 2022. Must be conifer or 4g. I order mine from Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Been buying Galaxy's since Day 1 of my smartphone life and this one, the FE20 is by far the biggest piece if crap made. I actually went back to my S10 as it is twice the phone (minus some camera stuff that is really unnecessary). Oh and the 5 G, turn it off as this phone performs twice as well while on a 3G network. Worth maybe $100 this headache riddled engineering fumble."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I currently have a Galaxy Note 10 and before that the Pixel 3. The Note 20 has been great but I've been wanting to upgrade to something with a better battery. I've tried the Note 20 Ultra (too big and bulky) and the Note 20 (not worth $999 or even $799) and finally arrived at the S20 FE. So far, the battery life has been great with 6-7 hours screen on time.

Compared to the Note line and pretty much everything else in the marketplace right now, this is a fantastic device at this price point. The screen is as good as the Note 20 line with its great color accuracy, sharpness and bright screen. While it doesn't have WQHD+ like the Note 20 Ultra, it does have 120hz which the Note 20 doesn't. So if you're running 120hz, you can't use WQHD+ anyway.

This device also has a fantastic camera system that takes better shots than the Note 20. I've compared them side by side and the S20 FE delivers more vibrant and sharper images. While the telephoto is only 8MP, it didn't seem to effect the quality and outputs pictures that were just as good as the Note 20. The Note 20 Ultra has an amazing telephoto, so if that's important to you, then go for it, but costing about $500 more than this device, seems not worth it.

If you're a Pixel user, One UI is an adjustment but I actually enjoy it with all the options it brings. Unlike past Samsung devices, their OS doesn't slow things down in the least and this phone is as fast as the Note 20's that I also tried out. Samsung has also been great about doing monthly updates and will be giving 3 years OS support on the S20 FE

I do wish it came with 8GB instead of 6 but I haven't noticed any performance issues as a result - the device feels just as fast and fluid as the other more expensive phones I tried with much more RAM. Perhaps if you're a gamer or heavy multi-tasker, this might be a bigger factor to consider in your decision to buy this device.

I've seen comments about the finger print scanner being unreliable but I haven't experienced that at all. In fact, it's been much more reliable and way faster than sonic ones in the newer Note 20 devices I tried.

If you're considering this over the Pixel 5, the S20 FE seems the better value with better CPU, 120hz screen and more versatile camera system (but the Pixel will undoubtedly take better pictures as its the camera king!), expandable storage, bigger battery and faster charging.

If you're considering this over the Note 20 (standard not Ultra), the S20 FE is a much better value for less money giving you 120hz screen, expandable storage and better camera. Unfortunately you lose out on the S-Pen with the S20 FE, but if you can go without, then the S20 FE is a much bigger bang for your buck.

At the end of the day, I think this phone is a superb value at $599 and the best you can get at this price point."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole. Just peek at the phone and you know the time & notifications. Always-on is the best feature. Perfectly happy with the styling and performance. Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.

I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery. Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter. I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.

The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention. A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly. Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including: phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more. What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps. It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to: Google App certification approved a set of ""unbranded"" apps to exist. The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information. For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity? There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"". [Try to find that in my apps.] The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos, swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous. Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed. Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements. Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.

The out of the box experience can be daunting. Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone. Setup can be never-ending. Each time you want to turn on the phone: you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be. Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let's just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.

A minor tip: The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box. For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting. After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot. There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top. The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got mine through ATT. I haven’t had any problems or issues. I use the Google Assistant a lot, and it’s better than Siri on my iPad. It brings up the results pretty fast and is usually accurate. This is really important to me. Battery lasts a long time, I can be on long conversations during the day and still have plenty of battery. It’s a large screen, which I like, especially having small screens in the past. But it’s smaller from side to side, and it’s perfect for me even though I have smaller hands. My photos are pretty good, I’m happy with them, and you scale it to way up close.
This is a really good phone in my opinion. However, the best phone I’ve had is an Alcatel 3V, but they don’t make them anymore. The best battery life is Nokia, but that was when you couldn’t access the internet"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.

Pros:
Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.
Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.
Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.
120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.
MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.
Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.
AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.
Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.

Cons:
No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.
Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.
Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.
Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.

Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.

Edit - July 2021 Update:
Been using the same phone still since September of 2020. I saw this phone was on sale for $479 a couple weeks ago for Amazon's Prime Day. This phone is a no brainer at that price. The touchscreen issues were all resolved with a few software updates late last year. I have not encountered any touchscreen issues since then and don't have any further complaints in the past year. Battery life still lasts a full work day from 7am to midnight with around 25-30% battery life left."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am notice all the bad reviews about this phone come from peoples who can’t even know how use a phone . Don’t pay attention if you want a real reviews look from professional tech . I am in shock how people complain about a cord or memory card slot in this time any high end device come like this also headphone jack is completely removed from any big manufacturer brand. If you want a good screen camera and performance buy this phone in my opinion is best value compared to the new galaxy s22 ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have no complaints about the phone, so far it has only exceeded my expectations. My problem is with how I received my package, which to be honest is probably Amazon's fault and not the seller's but regardless, I spent roughly $600 on the s20 fe, plus a charger, cables, and a case. The package arrived a day ahead of schedule but when i opened it I realized there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. You'd think for 600 dollars amazon could throw in a couple of plastic bags filled with air, or even just some crumpled paper."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.

As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.

I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It's amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I've gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.

Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it's solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can't attest to it's usefulness in this review; but I'm sure it's fine!

My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can't knock it because of this.

Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone in December 2021 because I had broken my Google Pixel 3a (first time ever without an OtterBox, and first time ever breaking a phone). This older model was on sale, and I desperately wish I hadn't done it. The camera (which I use a lot) is, frankly, CRAPPY and not worth anything. If you don't much care about the camera, it's a fine, generally functional phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything about this phone, I hate it...I can't get AT&T to replace it unless I get a whole new plan....RIP off!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just received my new phone and so far it’s working good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you want a big phone with state of the art features, the S20FE really has no competition. It does pretty much everything the more expensive S20 phones do at a much much lower price point. And if you have a decent phone to trade in (go the Samsung site for more details), it is practically a a steal. I traded S10e and got this one for $285. Hard to beat.
There are few minor difference from the more expensive siblings, like a glass vs plastic back and a 10X vs 3X optical zoom. The screen res is bit lower on the FE but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference. It is great screen. Oh, and no millimeter 5G, just the low end version of 5G, which is all that exists now anyway in 95 percent of the US. And a lot of places don't even have that yet.
If you can live with those minor shortcomings, this is the phone for you. Also be aware this phone is actually bigger than the S20 and almost as big as the plus.
The super fast 120 refresh rate is a big selling point. Something almost no other phone, beyond the S20 lineup, has. Makes scrolling super smooth and fast. Stereo speakers sound better than most phones. Wifi 6 support. In screen finger printer reader works well. But also has face recognition unlock. Infinitely customizable, as most of Samsung's high end phones are.
There are only a few downsides. It comes with a low end, regular than fast charger. But if you have an older Samsung phone with fast charger, it will work here. Some idiot decided to do away with a simple power button. You have to press volume AND the Bixby button to turn if on or off. Insane. You can change that in the settings and make the Bixby button the power button (which should have been the default). Bixby (digital assistant) is a major pain in the butt, but you can drive a stake through its heart and get rid of it completely with some effort. Google it. Many different settings must be changed.
Overall, this is the best phone for the money I have seen in a long time. Don't bother with anything else if you want a state of the art phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice Phone, loads fast, good camera, and good battery life.
Purchased on black Friday at a good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.
One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.
I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.
Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!
Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?
So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I use Lapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.
Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.
Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update when I test them.
Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!
Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed to get a most feature phone and must admit I'm quite satisfied, although most of the time I have LTE+ on the network bar instead of 5g, and the battery life is not that awesome. I don't use my phone that often with stuff like you tube or social medias but I have to charge it every night."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Is this phone dual sim?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","9/10 I have had this phone for about a month, waited to write a review to see if I was going to run into any issues, the only slightly negative thing I can think of is the facial recognition doesn't register a lot, unless I'm holding the phone at a certain angle. And the finger print sensor might take two trys sometimes. The camera is amazing, the battery life is even better. Charge time is quick, I had a note 9 before this and I am very pleased. Ignore bad reviews. I gave this phone time to have issues and found none."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Terrible phone can't recieve messages and calls.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I went from a Samsung Galaxy S10+ to this Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. It sucks. I'd almost like to go back to my S10+! (Except that one was ancient -- it had become slow and the battery was dying way too quickly between charges.)
Anyway, back to the S21 ... this has AWFUL reception. It also has HORRIBLE connection issues -- when I'm on WiFi, I can't even send text messages. They spin for a while, then bounce back to me. I try again and again, and they may or may not ever get sent. Pictures will stall and not send and maybe randomly get sent 8 or 12 hours later no matter if I'm sending them (well, trying to send them) over wifi or cell to an iPhone or another Android phone, and regardless of the recipient's carrier.
The screen is clear and responsive, and it takes nice photos. But overall, I'm very disappointed in this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It says unlocked for all carriers, but Verizon couldn't activate it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls. I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either..... The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe. I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges. This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.
I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.
I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential. It has reasonable storage.
The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still miss In fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.
THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone. This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL. I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case. The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger. So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.
It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.
I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.
I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one. That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.
Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch: The Wear app doesn't do much. It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face. As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My greatest disappointment with this phone was the fact that less than 3 months after I was having serious issues with the charging port. Amazon doesn't provide much support and was referring me directly to Samsung to have my issue resolved or ask for a refund."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","About the same performance as my budget phone. Unbelievable how much more money. I do not recommend. Won't buy another Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone has worked great for me. It is annoying how big it is but I am slowly getting used to it. I bought it for the large battery and it has worked out great for me. I only really have to charge it once a day unless I am watching videos then maybe twice. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after 10 months of having it my power on/off button on the side fell out. I have not been ruff with the phone. I haven't dropped it in liquid(s) or on hard surfaces. It just fell out from normal use, phone calls, texts, and watching videos. So far samsung doesn't seem to helpful and it sounds like this is an issue with the phone model, along with the volume button falling out. Hopefully that doesn't happen for me soon. Samsung said that it isn't covered under the warranty and only software issues are covered under the warranty. The were sneaky and sent me an email saying they were going to charge me about $151 in repair fees without even asking me if I was willing to pay."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm not a gamer with new toy. First thing was to disable/uninstall before temptation sets in. By doing so and using this phone for calls, messages, browsing, photos it is now been a 10 hour day and I still have 85%. The hardest part has-been finding a solution to butt calls to 911. Solved. No lock screen. Not worried as phone is with me. All accounts password protected. All apps are in folders so no problem there. Except I then had to disable ""gestures"" because of all the screens hots while in pocket. Bixby keeps coming on all by itself but somewhere I did see a remove Bixby button. Must have been once in a lifetime shot. Can't find it again. I think it is in a privacy setting. Pictures are good but honestly my old note 3 can compete. I had used fingerprint which works great but it brings back the chance of 911 calls. They should reconfigure the 911 button to bring up a dialer with just 3 numbers 091, then you can call 911 or operator. I got a case from caselogic and the plate charger has no problem. Also disable the phone suggesting stuff to me. Too stupid. These guys think I bought a traveling billboard. IT IS A PHONE. It would be sad to be addicted to a gamer, kill the battery and not be able to call for help."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone and dropped it while trying to unlock my door which wasn't very high up. I had a sturdy phone case and the glass cracked from the inside out where the fingerprint scanner is so even though I wanted to keep using it it annoyed me because I couldn't feel the cracks but the phone couldn't read my finger prints. I sold it at a phone recycling kiosk for 60 bucks."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Update#2: The reason you want to buy the Fan Edition of Samsung Galaxy phones is because you can use the Samsung DEX app. If you don't use the app than any android phone will work fine. But with the Samsung DEX app it makes all the difference. only the S phones are supported on the DEX app. Although the A series supports Windows Link. It's garbage compare to the DEX app.

Update: been using it daily for 3 months now. All the accessories for this phone is cheaper than the rest of the S20 lineup except the battery. The battery for this month is 3~5X more than other Samsung phones. Makes it expensive to repair, like if Samsung doesn't want you to replace it.

So far I thought the FE 5G is a pretty good phone.

You get the camera app of the s20 ultra.
Pro camera settings you can only find on high end cameras.
Dolby Atoms audio.
Micro SD memory slot. yep it's a option that's missing on the S21s.

Some minor issues.
Bluetooth audio device missing battery % indicators."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone for the price! I love the color and style. It's very fast working, great sound, love the non-curved screen!I have seen some glitches with the fingerprint scanner,connection issues, and issues with messaging. Overall,definitely love this phone and always recommend it to other around me !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got my phone at Costco, and I like it for the most part. I bought a basic protective case without a glass screen. My phone has dropped 2 times from about 3 feet with the case, and the screen has cracked. I'm now investing in a case with a glass screen protector. I don't beat up my phone, but that is just WAY TOO Sensitive."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far so good. Item arrive earlier than originally expected.
If it does not work on your GSM sim card, do a little troubleshooting before you call your carrier to make the assistance efficient.
In my experience, when they activated it, it automatically work as 5G. I got that sim card with the phone carrier early this year. Idk if that makes a difference. I am still exploring but so far so good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I wanted to love this phone. It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.

1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.

2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.

Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is a good phone overall but
The front facing camera is blurry in low light and the selfie makes your teeth somehow browner which is not good for a selfie lover.
Wish they fix this on update."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not sure about anyone else but after 1 year the battery life is no good. Don't hardly talk ot text and have to charge it once to twice a day. It otherwise been a good phone. Note the battery draining started after a Samsung update and has gotten worse"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Every time i try to unlock my phone it doesn't register and you have to spam slap the s out of your thumbprint scanner with your thumb a million times before it actually unlocks, the face reco sucks, and i hate all slower methods so it's a giant regret for me. I've tried every option i can possibly find on google/reddit to fix it, but in the end it's just garbage. The rest of the phone is ""decent"" i guess when you can finally unlock it. I'd suggest either buying a cheaper phone and getting the same performance since it doesn't matter when the ease-of-use is not there, and everything else is just kept up to modern standards. Or buy a better phone for 150-200$ more. I'd suggest anything under the 20fe if you like samsung, or a google pixel, orrr any iphone 10 and above. gl."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros:
1. FLAT SCREEN. Thank God now i can get a cheap tempered glass protector and not have accidental edge touches. Works great.

2. 120hz screen. Full HD+ is perfect for this size and the 120hz does make a difference scrolling through websites and images.

3. Micro SD card Expandable storage, wireless charging, on screen fingerprint scanner, fast charging.

4. Huge 4500mah battery lasts two days for heavy users.

5. Triple camera setup. The 3x optical zoom on the telephoto is nice.

6. Nice feeling plastic back i like better than glass. No cracking.

7. Water resistance.

8. Great lower price!

Cons:
1. 6gb RAM is more than enough for my use case even when i play games but 8gb would've been nice to have.

2. 3x optical zoom camera is nice but also maybe a bump up to 12mp or 16mp and a bigger aperture would be an improvement.

Best Samsung Galaxy phone in the last 5 years!! Stick with flat screen and lower prices Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Absolutely the best phone to buy and have in 2021 it's perfect for everything you need trust me definitely a must have .

Also the battery life on this phone is extraordinary."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone works fine but not enough memory."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Every member of my family got one of these phones when we switched to Verizon a few months ago, and every single one of us has experienced at least one critical failure with these phones. One doesn't receive half of the texts that are sent to it, and it doesn't notify the sender nor receiver that something went wrong. Another will unlock itself randomly while it's in a pocket and start opening everything and anything and then send or submit random gibberish text to anyone and anything it pulls up, and this is despite having the accidental unlock protection on. Mine has had repeated issues with the accidental unlock protection as well, but the icing on the cake was today when it changed my unlock pattern without any input. It was in my pocket since the last time I unlocked it, so it's safe to rule out someone else changing it to mess with me.
This phone is a completely unusable piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs. You'd be better off with a Nokia brick phone from the 90s than one of these overpriced plastic turds."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone is alright. After about 8-9 months of use the battery life is taking a significant dip. On the other hand, Samsung support is terrible and doesn't listen. I tried to get their help with a minor issue and they dragged it out into a 3 month process and they didn't even attempt to resolve my issue. I'm done with Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","When you look at texts you have to push another prompt to be able to call the individual who texted you. Why not just push phone? Maybe not a big if you have time but if you need to make 3/4 calls in 5 10 minutes it is. The playback button is right next to the call back. If your in a hurry and busy that causes issues because, and maybe it's just me but sometimes I push the call back and have to hang up or talk to someone when I'm pinched for time. Another issue, that I had with my S10 when you push phone massages I keep getting texts massages. WTH! Only way I can get to my phone message is by restart which is more time intensive than the S10.
The people who designed this have no idea how busy a professional can be between clients, customers. If you have lots of free time and patience and are very tech savvy this might be the phone for you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.

The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Camera Picture quality is nothing compared to my note 10 and newer models and the battery life is horrible even after adjusting everything possible. When I looked into trading it in it's not even an option thru Samsung I guess I'm stuck with it. Save your money and by the note 10 or a newer nicer model. Don't settle."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It feels like a generation has passed compared to the iPhone 11. First thing I liked best is the zoom lens that zooms in 3x and does not loose a bit focus or clarity. Plus the screen is AMAZING. LED 120hz it is very smooth and fast. The downside is the OS. APPLE has android beat hands down for OS smoothness, screen sensitivity (I am often cought touching the sides of the phone screen and clicking when I wasn't trying too on samsung.) Being 23 years old I can learn to navigate android but APPLE IS BETTER FOR 40+ years old! Next year will be switching to iphone 13 but battery life is good OS just needs simplification."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cute phone. Feels a little plastic and light weight. Has a bad battery or something but I didn't have any problems with getting it to connect to my mobile network. My mobile network is T-Mobile/Metro."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had four Samsung smart phones. One bought from carrier, others bought from Samsung. The first one is Galaxy A, about ten months later, the inner speaker doesn’t work, have to use out speaker to pick up calls. But the carrier replaced it for me quickly. The second one is S9, about 13 months, it can’t charge by cable, because out of the warranty, I have to buy a wireless charger to use it. The third one is S9+, about 15months, the fingerprint reader doesn’t work properly, I have to use pin or face ID to unlock the phone every time to use it. The fourth one is Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, about 10 months, the WiFi cannot turn on. I went to a repair spot authorized by Samsung two times in a month, then they said they can’t fix it, need change the mainboard, no values for repairing. I have to contact Samsung. Guess what they said? They refused to replace it and told me I have to mail in the phone to Samsung then they will decide what they can do. That means in about one month, I will have no phone to use. For saving your time and money, think twice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love the phone 📱,

Not crazy about the buttons on one side because of the screen shot process, will get use to it.

I used the S20 FE all day, more than usual, to see how the battery life was and to me it was great. I upgraded from the Galaxy S9 because I was tired of constantly charging it.

Do wish Samsung would give the ok to have Otterbox and other companies have cases available when the phone is ordered.

Well worth the money, did not want to spend a fortune for the S20."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Pros: competitive pricing for its specs, almost no bloatware, durable, colors look amazing

Cons: battery life is awful"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","On paper the phone looks great. But coming from an S9, I wish I would not have purchased the S20FE. The virtual proximity sensor is awful. 8 times out of 10, it will inactivate the phone if it's against your ear. But 2/10 times it will not and if you are moving around while on the phone, you will dial other people, hang up, put the call on hold - you name it. The LED notifications are gone and replaced with on screen notifications. First thing I noticed was the charging screen notification, nothing will burn in a screen like repetitive text. The fingerprint scanner is worse than prior versions - again the S9, was far more advanced. The Gorilla glass 3 will be less impact resistant than the 5 used on other phones. The glass has an odd cheap feel, like I have plastic on it, but I don't. The camera produces ok shots, but all need some touchups when I get home. Either over exposed or too much contrast... Selphies are also pretty bad, the fixed focus just doesn't do a good job. Then there are the screen problems. I haven't quite figured this out, but I get ghost touches and ignored touches. Playing with the sensitivity does not resolve the issue. If you, like me spend a lot of time on the phone, you better get a headset, as using this phone, as a phone will result in hangups and all sorts of issues because of the crappy proximity sensor.
I tested the Wifi compared to my wife's S9 and the S9 would consistently get > 120Mbs, the S20FE was averaging just over 100Mbs. Used the same SSID and was in the exact location. So the S20FE loses the battle against the S9 in terms of screen quality and scratch resistance, fingerprint scanning, proximity sensor, typing accuracy and wifi speed. Pretty bad that a 2 year old phone is better than a brand new one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's good I got this on sale because it's not worth full price. Battery sucks, camera is good but doesn't capture movement very well/easy to blur, the voice text is glitchy and doesn't offer correct words when it guesses wrong, and the Bixby was sssuuupppeerrrr annoying. Also wish it was a touch smaller. MAKE SMALLER PHONE FOR SMALL HAND PPL!
If they actually made better phones in 2020 or 2021, I'd get that but honestly there really isn't anything much better xp"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","got this as a gift, so I returned it ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

no sd card slot!! It's like a bought an Iphone - garbage with limitations! Charging for more memory when sd cards are so cheap...Samsung can shove this phone in the trash with the old exploding phones they made!

Go to an older model or a different brand!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I took advantage of the T-mobile trade-in program to upgrade my aging early 2018 Samsung S9 64GB to this new late 2020 Samsung S20 FE 128GB which allowed me to get this phone for $200 + taxes. Overall, it's a very good phone for the price even without trade-in, but there are some pros & cons which I'm going to lay out below.
*** Pros:
- Price / Affordability. Obviously this is the biggest pro of the S20 FE as you can upgrade to one of the newest phones from samsung for not too much without having to shell 1000 dollars or more.
- The S20 FE has 6GB of RAM which is an upgrade over the S9's 4GB of RAM. Although looking at my Android's settings Device Care info, I seem to see a larger RAM usage for the S20 FE (around 3.4GB usage without any apps open which leaves about 2.6GB available when idle, versus around 2GB of available space when idle for the S9. So you gain a little but not as much as expected. This may be due to the new upgraded Snapdragon 865 processor being more memory hungry than the outdated processor on the S9.
- The S20 FE has 128GB of onboard drive space which is twice as much as the S9. So this is def a big plus. Also you can add up to 1TB of SDXC memory.
- The Cameras are much better on the S20 FE than my old S9, no doubt. You benefit from the 3 camera setup with good performing lenses on the 0.5x, 1x and 3x lenses. As a professional in the photo/video business, it's very welcome and you will be happy with the S20 FE's camera performance overall. The selfie camera also is a big improvement over the S9.
- The Fingerprint sensor placement is much better at the front of the handset below the display. A big improvement over the S9 which was at the back of the phone.
*** Tie
- In terms of overall performance and daily usage, I would say you get about the same performance as the S9. You won't notice that the S20 FE is snappier or slower than the S9 for most apps used. Browsing feels about the same, even though the S20 FE touts the 120Hz display, but has a lower pixel density in terms of screen resolution. Colorwise, they are about the same in terms of vivid colors or contrast/brightness.
- In terms of battery life, I see to get about the same performance as my S9, even though the S20 FE touts a larger battery, but also has a bigger display so it evens out.
- In terms of 5G performance, I tested it in a few places and I don't see much improvements in terms of Upload or Download performance over 4G LTE. It's very uneven depending on where you are. On T-mobile, I get about 40Mb/s to 90Mb/s downlink with 5G vs 50Mb/s to 75Mb/s with 4G downlink. and around 25Mb/s uplink for 5G and 4G similarly when I'm in a good area. So I decided to just switch back from 5G to 4G LTE settings on my android phone, so meh... as far as 5G is concerned... maybe this will improve over time.
*** Cons:
- My biggest con is the S20 FE definitely feels heavier and is much larger to hold than the S9. It is about the size of the S20+ and I wished they kept the width of the S9/S10/S20 so that one-handed usage is much easier. With a protective case added to the S20 FE, you will be hard pressed to use this phone one-handed unless you have big hands. I don't unfortunately. After all, they called it the S20 Fan Edition, so why make it so much larger? Samsung could have made the S20 FE taller but kept the S20 width... Food for thought for later iterations! Please keep this in mind Samsung. Not everyone wants a larger screen at the cost of having to use 2 hands all the time.
- As others have said, why did they put the volume buttons on the right hand side? Why not keep these buttons on the left hand side? Probably because it's a two-handed device, so they thought, might as well have everything on one side so you operate it with your thumb... Poor design/UX in my opinion.
- Loss of the 3.5mm phone jack. Alas this is becoming standard on most higher end phones from Samsung/Google/Apple... Sad... Now you have to use a dongle and can't charge & listen to music with a wired headset at the same time unless you buy another heavier dongle with those 2 ports (USB-C & 3.5mm) which may or may not work seamlessly... I decided to buy the Samsung 3.5mm to USB-C dongle because there doesn't seem to be a dual port dongle that works perfectly yet. And I don't like using bluetooth all the time with a wireless headset.
- It's still early for the release of this phone, so you won't get many good covers & screen protectors alas... I bought a clear cover from T-mobile TO-GO branded, and so far it is just too bulky & uncomfortable of a cover and way more expensive than on Amazon. But the covers on amazon are not yet shipping... Something to bear in mind as you will pay 2x or 3x more via T-mobile to get those accessories right away.
- One last small pet peeve, is the loss of the kind of clean wallpapers I had with the S9, now you get those flowery preloaded wallpapers that are just not UI friendly, they are too bright and busy so your icons & Time/Date don't separate nicely from the wallpaper background... You gotta download themes/wallpapers from the Samsung Store to get some equivalent ones... but not exactly the same as S9 which were so nice.

So in Summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G offers a nice cost effective way to upgrade your aging android phone that's say 2-years old or more... like it did for me with my former S9. You gain in RAM, drive space, and a larger display, but you lose in terms of one-handed usage and a heavier phone to hold, carry around, and larger to slip in your pockets, and no more 3.5mm headphone jack... sigh. There isn't much improvement in terms of performance, operability, or battery life over the S9, but at least you know that this S20 FE is close to being the latest and greatest from Samsung for the next couple years until you upgrade again to another iteration... For me, it's a 4/5 star phone and is worth the upgrade from the S9 still but I'm missing my S9 already because it was so good at doing most everything with just one hand... now I gotta use 2 hands with this phone most of the time... but at least I have enough onboard fast memory space with 128GB which will allow me to add more apps/take more photos/videos when the apps need the speed of onboard memory to take the photo shot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great all around phone. I have never had a samsung phone before. This phone is solid all around and an upgrade from my LG G7. I love getting 5G signal all over the place. The phone's battery lasts all day. The screen is crisp. The camera is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","All the features I want for a reasonable price during black friday!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. It cost only $750, tops. I'm upgrading from the Galaxy S9. Although I can't find many changes, I can see that it's much faster. And all the previous features have been upgraded to present day standard."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I couldn't set phone voice volume outside of a phone call (even though I thought I had maxed out every volume option available) and I couldn't hear an important phone call. No headphone jack."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is excellent, I love it. It has everything plus more. I love comparing it to my girlfriend, iPhone 12 plus which has no fingerprint unlock. And the features on this phone are endless."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone to buy IF Samsung fixes all the screen problems! Some software updates have been released but problems still persist."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had the phone for about year and it works fine in the beginning but the phone began to lock up after system update. I sent it back to Samsung for warranty repair and got my phone back and the problem was never fix and the pin unlock is still not working. So I will stay away from Samsung from now on. I have been using Samsung for over 10 years and this will be my last Samsung phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No me agrada el grosor del móvil, para ser última y alta gama, muy grueso. (Mismo grosor de los móviles en los últimos 4 años)
No me venía auriculares, y en la descripción indica que vendrían manos libres.
Algo lento en ciertas apps.
Lector de huellas muy bien.
Reconocimiento fácil muy bien.
Vida útil de la batería similar al de Galaxy Note 8 (El que he usado por casi 4 años)
No vuelvo a comprar Samsung, probaré Apple."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had it since middle of Oct. 2020. MY GRIPES: (1) As usual, I have tried 3 times to dictate this and I watch it flashing, then it stops and types NOTHING. (2) It FREEZES all the time, no matter what app I am in. (3). When I dictate period at the end of a sentence or comma somewhere, it spells it out. (4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase. (9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head, white shoulders and an orange background. I just noticed it a week or so ago. When I clicked on All Contacts, it shows Phone, where I back up my phone to and Verizon Cloud. Almost all Contacts had backed up to my phone. It was a nightmare to fix and get added where I 2anted them to be. I had duplicates galore. When I tried to delete or merge the duplicates, IT ADDS THEM BACK AS A 2nd Contact of the same person THAT CANNOT BE ERASED! I don't know it it is because this phone has Linked Accounts at the end of every contact! I think that is the problem.

I gave tried 4 times to dictate this to no avail. THIS PHONE HAS BEEN ONE MASSIVE HEADACHE AFTER ANOTHER. SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND TROUBLE!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am writing this review just to let everyone know that either some or all of the units have defective touch screen issues. Just Google it and you will find out. Samsung is not very helpful in this matter and their repair option thru ubreakifix wants to just change my screen which is not acceptable option."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is bad but not horrible.

Samsung software is like a virus you can't delete"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This review is for the experience buying this phone directly from samsung.
Trade-in, purchased worked ok
They offered 6 months free spotify but it never worked. CS doesn't help but asks me to directly contact spotify"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this phone from Amazon in November 2020. In most ways it's an excellent product.

However after 6 months of routine use the POWER button fell out of the phone. I searched online and discovered this was a common problem, but I imagined it would be a simple repair I brought the phone to a Samsung Authorized Service Center which told me that:

1) Loss of the POWER button was considered “cosmetic” damage by Samsung and would not be covered under the 1 year warranty

2) The POWER button is integrated with the display and cannot be replaced independently. So in order to fix the button I would have to pay for a new screen.

I phoned Samsung customer service and they repeated the same explanation, but offered that I had the option of bringing the phone to a Samsung owned service center (a 90 minute drive each way) where they would inspect the phone and if the loss of the button was deemed a manufacturing problem then the replacement would be free. Otherwise I would have face the same charge for screen replacement and I would have wasted half a day getting there and back.

It's extremely disappointing that the only frequently used moving parts on this otherwise fine product are engineered with such flimsy plastic.

It's extremely disappointing that Samsung does not accept any responsibility for the design problem.

Any customers who buy the phone based on its otherwise good performance and value should exercise great care when pressing the POWER and VOLUME buttons to avoid unwelcome repair expense."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I HATE THIS PHONE.
For starters: The gallery icon disappeared from the text app and I can't get it back.
This is typical. The phone make changes and never shows you how to restore them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First things first: it has no headphone jack. Every phone should have a headphone jack. Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead. If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you. The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras. Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.
The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes. My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.

It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review. But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Performance = 9 / 10 - fast Snapdragon cpu but only only 6gb ram

Design = 8.7 / 10 - flat screen but bezels could be smaller

Camera = 9 /10 - great main cameras - selfie camera is MEH and pics can be blurry on moving objects

Features = 9/10 - three years of software updates..5g...a lot of color options .. ip68 .. wireless charging .. dex"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","trying to group apps into folders. When I select the app I want to group, normally it should show other apps that I can drop it on & create a folder. the Galaxy S20 FE 5G sometimes lets you do that & most of the time doesn't show any other apps that you want to group them with. I wish LG still made cell phones because this phone is a POS which is short for piece of crap."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone itself is pretty good, but the glass they use on it is terrible. Try to find what they use, good luck. Corning doesn't list this model as using their glass. If you need to have the glass fixed, it is easily the cheapest of the Samsung phones to repair. My phone fell 1 foot onto a wood floor and cracked all the way across. Cheapest replacement glass, no listed version of what they use, and it breaks after a laughably minor fall = bad glass. Do not buy this phone. But any other version of the S20 or a S21, they at least admit they use good glass on those."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.

I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.

The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.

The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.

Pictures are blurry.

Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.

Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought the S20 FE so I could utilize the MST payment feature in Samsung Pay but since I received an International version of the phone, Samsung Pay does not work in the US. It is ridiculous that a Samsung app on a Samsung phone does not work in the US."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","AVOID THIS SELLER: TOTAL SCAM!!
WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STAR REVIEW!!

Have had nothing but issues trying to connect to a network. I have at&t, the phone won't allow me to make calls, can only use this phone with wifi access. It's essentially a small tablet right now. Even though I have at&t, the phone still says ""Sprint"" in the upper left corner. I'm trying to work with Amazon to return this phone currently. I'll update this review when I get a response.

UPDATE
No word from Amazon or this Seller still. This phone is absolutely useless. Sprint doesn't even exist anymore. I could not be more disappointed or furious. May as well have burned the $700 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If I sound incoherent it is because I am using this device's is this device's voice to text function is function to write this review to review so that you can see 1st hand you can see 1st hand how buggy this device is this device's. It's worse, you cannot open the weather app because it will automatically because it will automatically open about 20 crap apps of no Is possible interest to anyone . So you don't use it. But then it opens its but then it opens itself and it's 20 friends. Isn't uns. It even downloads new apps without it's it's new apps without asking if I want them and keeps changing my keypad and keeps changing my keypad to Greek or Swahili or is Greek or Swahili or Croatian or God knows what period . Is I am mystified as to why 80% of reviewers gave 5 stars to this piece of junk"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I had my unlocked phone for 5 days--bought directly from Samsung. I had it in light bumper case, with reinforced corners. Clearly it was not enough.

I was in a forested park today when I dropped it on soft ground. The back lower right corner hit a stone. It is cosmetically perfect, but it will no longer turn on. I've tried multiple ways to reset and charge, but it is dead. I've had 4 Samsung phones before. But I've Never ""bricked"" one.

I was disappointed in the case maker and the phone maker. I do not have a protection plan, but I feel like this is a failure of the maker of this supposedly shock resistant phone. I will contact Samsung, but I thought I should leave this as a warning.

It is a nice phone, but get a thick case, people."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.

UPDATE: well, things went south fast. This phone seemed great first couple of weeks but then it started showing problems. The brightness ALWAYS acting up, even after disabling adaptive brightness, when I am in direct sunlight outside it DIMS and I can barely see. The phone freezes and gotten very slow. Also every software update seems to make it worse, mostly recent update (3/26/2021) caused several apps like weather app to glitch. It's just so much trouble. I have only had this phone for few months and I already want to switch back to Google pixel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this phone at AT&T store - good phone overall, except for noted samsung weaknesses, including spotty fingerprint recognition, mediocre front facing camera, but the real weakness is a screen that dims to black on a warm (84F) day in full sunlight. The phone is not usable outside in bright light after 2 minutes due to overheating and black out of display."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Worst phone I ever purchased. I researched and took time to choose this phone and thought I made a good decision. I was so wrong. Its overbloated with a lot of junk that dosent work. Battery life is terrible and charges incredibly slow. I can't depend on it to go to the store and have it work for me the full trip in case of emergencies. Calling it wireless is funny! It always has a wire for charging attached to it. Im used to Motorola moto z phones. I switched to Samsung to try something new and I'm so sorry that I did. My heart sunk when I took it out of the box.Never again. I doubted that it was even new cuz it had a funny sticker on the back that I had seen on refurbished phones id gotten in past. The most dissapointing purchase of 2020 for me.. oh i bought 2 :>(. Ugh im stuck till next year boo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had the Samsung 20FE for about 5 months. Had to replace my Galaxy s10 plus. What an absolute downgrade. The phone is buggy, has screen and charging issues. Constant bluetooth issues. Horrible audio feedback via bluetooth echo and static on calls. The phones hardware is a step down from all its borthers and sisters meaning this is the ""ugly stepchild"" from Samsung. Save your money, this phone will cause more stress and headaches worth than the extra 300 you saved from its better brother. My provider will not accept a return even thought ive been a customer for 20 years. Worst Samsung phone ive ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone is nice, a solid upgrade from my S8. But it's basically an air hockey puck and will slip off of flat surfaces unprovoked. The glass is also not impact-resistant. Mine fell 18"" from a living room table while I was on the other side of the room and the screen cracked. $300 to repair after a week of ownership. Oh, and protective cases are on backorder everywhere, so if you order the phone, lock it in a drawer for a few weeks until your Otterbox arrives!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you plan on traveling internationally and need eSIM support, this phone has eSIM disabled by Samsung. The hardware is there but for some reason (likely politics between US carriers and Samsung) you cannot use this feature."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is the worst phone I've ever owned. Run. DO. NOT. BUY. My husband was on a trip 4 weeks after purchasing and while walking through the airport it deleted all his data and photos and then locked him out. Too late to get a refund. Last week while my phone was in my purse the accessibility mode turned on. Then would not allow me to reset and eventually froze me out. It took 2 calls to Verizon and one call to Samsung to get it fixed. These are horrible phones. If I could give negative stars I would."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","the screen literally cracked the first time i touched it. Don't waste your money. TRASSSSSSSSSSSSSH."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","If you buy the new s21 phones you are getting ripped off. The s21 and the s21 plus went down in ram, display is less, and the ultra starts at 1,400. I want to see Samsung eat these phones and lose money because there just taking advantage of people who don't know any better. So buy an s20 plus gets a lot for your money or but one of these phones they are equally the same as the 21 and the 21 plus. Thanks for reading"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Phone lags a lot and constantly have to reboot it. Certain apps cause the phone to wig out. My S8+ that was 3 years old was better than this phone and i wish i still had it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not a good phone. Does not stand up to other samsungs. Has a lot of glitches that just aren't getting addressed by samsung because its the cheapo version. the touchscreen works maybe 15% of the time. the rest of the time it is ""lights on but nobody home."" the fingerprint reader is absolutely awful. even when the touchscreen is having a good day, the finger print reader never works (it's also in an awkward place). nothing fancy about the screen, functions, or camera. overall very unhappy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The first handset had an unresponsive screen and was overheating like crazy.

The second one, the replacement, seemed fine out of the box until it started to overheat again and the battery would drain like crazy! Yet again! Also, this phone would just randomly freeze.

This was supposed to be my first samsung phone (based upon its great reviews), but, i wont probably ever get a samsung. My 2 year old Mate 20 pro is superior in almost every way!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not worth the money. Get a a71 5g for half the price for more bang for your buck."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The specs are great the camera isn't the best but you shouldn't expect it. The only thing wrong with the plastic back is that it's way too slick, even the edges. But the worst thing and the reason you shouldn't buy this phone is because the used old gorilla glass the break really really easy. Including the camera glass. Do no buy. Doesn't matter the rest of the specs if your phone shatters with the slightest fall. Look this up if you don't believe me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Don't waste your money on this phone. Retired my s8 and got a new phone with the same issues - lousy battery, screen freezes, and GPS does not work. Piece of junk for $700."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is garbage since Samsung wants to force its apps on the customer. There is a so called ""Free"" app that wants to push contents on you. There is no way to get rid of it. It is always open and as you switch apps, it comes right as the first option"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've been a OnePlus fan for years. I've owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They've always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.

So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I'm so happy with the 7t?

Well, I have to confess. I'm getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.

Then there's this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I've been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t's wide-angel lens isn't all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.

So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I'm not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it's 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it's 5x zoom? Nuts.

$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?

Now *that* was worth a look.

I'm glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I've only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I'm duly impressed.

Now I won't belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.

So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don't think there's really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""

The Good...

* I've never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I've dialed mine back to 60hz. I'm not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.

* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I've seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn't squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don't have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)

* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it's app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.

* <drumroll> The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It's a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone's crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I've printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it's workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn't use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they're unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I'm paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I'm getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don't do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.

* Memory Card slot. Why can't Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn't Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!

* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn't as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It's just not annoying. ;)

The Bad

* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?

* Plastic back. Some people don't like this. I'm fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you're spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn't going to win you over.

* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that's the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.

* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don't need 12gig, and I've never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it's time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.

The Meh

* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don't need 5G. I'm not streaming 8k to my phone. I'm just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.

* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it's utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!

* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.

* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can't tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )

Bottom line...

This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it's in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it's a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Had the regular s21, and it was all right. Screen broke do to my on negligence. So I seen to s21 fe on Amazon for a good price. Everything on the FE is better fingerprint scanner face recognition and it's faster even though it's got six gigs of RAM instead of eight. I love it!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i had the following questions:
1. would it really be new out of the box?
2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?
3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?

The answers:
1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal. Flawless condition

2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera. With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.

The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness. The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen. i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness. But that means much less battery life.

3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediately

Conclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera. You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.

If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Did a lot of research after my old favorite LG phone's battery slowly died. This phone was categorized as something of a 3rd tier phone, and kind of the economy model of S21. Some of the ""experts"" has some critical comments about it, but I decided to give it a shot. So far, this has been a great phone that I'd recommend highly. Battery life has been terrific - up to 2+ days per charge - photos are very good, it's a good, easy to hold size and the 256GB of storage should be all I need. The phone is much faster than my old LG. It may not be considered a 1st tier phone, but it's all I need. My only criticism is that the phone is a little slick, which makes it feel like it could easily slip out the hand. The addition of a slim case solved that issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","After a couple of weeks I really like this phone. It's fast and has a beautiful screen, big but not too big. My S7 died so I had to upgrade, this was a major upgrade for me. I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat. My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn't really lose anything, the rest was backed up to my Google account. I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor. Not bad for the price, I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did. The S7 was the only one that ever died on me, I have my original Galaxy, an S3, S5, S7 (dead) and my Samsung flip phone still. Now the S20 FE and I can definitely recommend it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The Galaxy S10 has a raised curved screen so the sides can be used to scroll and get flashing notifications. There are no cases that can protect the screen, replaced broken screen protectors all the time. The Galaxy S20 FE G5 has dropped in price and you can buy cases that protect it. The screen protectors glass work well because the screen is not raised as much. 5G is faster than 4glite and gets more bars in our area where 4G lite is poor. Also T-Mobile’s new 5G home internet can use 4G Lite bands for large movie streaming users. My 4G phone internet has slowed down on T-Mobile. Need to upgrade my other phone to 5G. Galaxy S20 FE has a plastic case with a metal band around the outside. I always use a good case so didn’t need to pay for the S20’s with stronger housing’s. Great upgrade for 5G and save money if you use a case and screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgraded from Galaxy S6 to this S20FE and it's night and day difference. Mild use of phone daily and battery is still 89% at the end of the day. Comes with battery option to stop charging at 85% to save your battery as well if you're interested. Great features all around. No 3.5mm but USB C dongle works just fine if you buy one separately. Can hook up USBC to HDMI and use it like it's own little computer or stream to a TV which is crazy. Can play PS Remote Play on monitor/tv if you hook it up that way. No controller lag with PS4 controller, both original and updated."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Before this, I had the Samsung S8. The S8 was great, until the market stopped 3G service. This is why I purchased the S21 phone. 4G and 5G capable. Works great on AT&T/Cricket Wireless network. Fingerprint reader is great. QR Code reader is great. If I have any issues I'll return and update this review."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","These slippery glass, expensive toys are too hard to handle - securely. Aside from the hundred of dollars, they are a pain to move from a broken one to a new one, a pain to reconfigure too. The Samsung S20 series are best of breed, whatever you will use it for, it is versatile, flexible, and there is an 'ap' for it that will do whatever you want any cell to do! It is sized to fit my hand, I think that it will fit your hand too. You'll need a teenager to get it going, configured for you and the flexibility is totally awesome. there are erbatteries in other phones, but this will cover you from sunrise to sunset."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from a Samsung J7 using Net 10.
Getting Net 10 phone number switched to this phone was not easy as I installed the ATT Sims. Net 10 switched the number OK but I couldn't call in or out. Finally I used the Verizon Sims and all is OK.
Note that Amazon has a Net 10 Kit for $1 with 3 sims, ATT, T-Mobile and Verizon. So try to find out which service your old phone uses. I gave them , the old phone sims # and they said to use AT&T but it was Verizon.
I love the S21 Fe's display, speed, everything works good but BIXBY is a PITA as I couldn't turned the phone off and the chat line was waiting for me to changes the sims. I found how to disable Bixby and all is OK.
It is very light and apps install easy. All is well using Net10.
SmartSwitch App was very helpful in moving contact, etc from my old J7."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my parents and so far they love it. The battery life span is great for a everyday use. The phone service is fast and easy to use. So far nothing negative about the phone.

Compare to the S20 and S20+ it's a bit smaller in size but you won't be able to tell the difference.

Camera is amazing. Pictures comes out HD.

I highly recommend this phone if you want a good everyday phone. For the price it's worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Legitimately love this phone, probably my favorite phone so far. It's lightweight, thin, sturdy build, fingerprint reader and face unlock work tremendously well. Comes with Android 12 out the box, cameras are amazing. Processor is smooth and amazing all day battery. Overall, perfect phone. It's a Samsung, so you can't expect anything but the best."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Forget the hype over the expensive, bank-breaking phones. The S20 FE is the next best thing, performs extremely well, takes great photos and video and does just about all the phones costing much more will do. The best part is you get to keep a few bucks in your pocket."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just got it yesterday, and so far I am very happy with the phone. I upgraded from an S7 Galaxy, this one is much faster and has a lot of great features. The changeover of my data was fairly painless as well. I think most people would be happy with it. Wasn't too sure about the color when I ordered it , but I find that it is kind of nice to have one that doesn't blend in with whatever I put it down on. Also nice to have one that doesn't look like every other phone out there!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","While this is a great phone and big improvement from my old J7 I strongly recommend either Amazon or the seller make a bigger effort to inform the buyer that you also need a 5G SIM card. Maybe try the bundle offer and it would be more obvious that the phone does NOT come with a SIM card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery life is pretty good depending on what you do, so if your watching lots of videos a mid afternoon boost helps. So far I love the cameras and their capabilities, is it a ""wow"" phone, not really but it is a pretty decent phone with no real complaints."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Battery holds up ok, drains from 100 to about 93 percent within 10 to 15 min of very minimum use after taking it off the charger. After that, battery last all day. Screen is fluid and processor is fast. The finger print reader is a bit slow. Face unlock is very quick. Camera quality is great. Night time picture looks as if it was taken at sunset.
Would love to see the 8 gb ram version in the 5g model. Overall the price is decent for a mid range phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! great replacement for my old phone and very happy that I could take my sim card out if my old phone and put in this phone. Skipped Verizons upcharge and high phone price and I may never buy a phone from them again lol. Glad I made this purchase. This phone also had SD slot for those that need that like I do... The face recognition and fingerprint security work great too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Upgrade to previous smartphone. It is a nice phone, larger in size but still suitable for pocket carrying. It charges quickly and holds a charge for the entire day. A very good camera and I am pleased with the S20 and did not feel it was an advantage to go to the S21."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought this S 20 fe in January and March 12th Green vertical line appears on right of screen return period to Amazon was on March 3rd and
contacted Samung chat on many occasions and was unsuccessful.This phone was $580."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Loving this do far. Everything is so fast and smooth, response time, load time, recognition, etc. Only complaint is I feel like the battery drain faster than I'd like. After about 8 hours of listening to podcast, it's at about 30%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I am hooked on Samsung, and have used straighttalk forever. I am not a ""put it on my plan"" type. I am still finding new things on my phone! I love it, super happy with purchase. Quick shipping, packaged well."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","i dropped the phone from literally less then a 1 foot drop and the camera cracked theres no cases available for a couple more werks which is almost asking for people to break there devices, camera sucks, they expect you to not drop it when the material itself if very slippery and smooth, big fail from samsung i wpuldnt buy this phone save your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me gusta"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","WAS going to buy an S21 5G… glad I didn’t…This gives you great features PLUS external memory card access… which I’d rather have… larger capacity of storage and removable JUST in case phone screws up… most newer phones don’t seem to have external... e.g. 5 S21'sHad almost a month and STILL putting in apps I NEED.. lolGREAT pictures and video… super clear with Night Mode…Video and it’ SOUND… did a short video in the Van Gogh Immersive Experience with super Loud music… audio was perfect… not overly compressed and sounding true to live as you can get from a PHONE…(I used Master music for TV, Movies, CDs… so DO have an ear… lol)…Anyway... GREAT phone for the $$$"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nice one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is great! I'm not sure how the flagship version is better, because this has everything I could want, and for a savings of about $500, I'm very happy I chose this model! Works great. Great camera. Battery life is LONG. Face recognition is not the best choice, right now, because of masks, so I can't speak to that, but the fingerprint reader is on point."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone, very pleased with finger print reader... However you can only record 3 different fingers. Very good phone - excellent camera, especially front facing!My only complaint, why it was 4 stars instead of 5 was we bought the orange color phone for my husband and when it came it was more of a light peach/pinky color. A nice color, but obviously more girly than anticipated. It's an easy fix to cover up, but we were disappointed because the color online looks more orange than it actually is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Fast shipping, great screen, it's big and fast processor"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung Sells overpriced phones on their site and repeatedly remove phones from 2020-2010, so they can sell pricy phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Like so far"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Is snappy, quick and does what I need it to do. Which is mostly watch videos and send memes to my sisters... it works. Looks good too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is really cool. Using it right now. Had issues at first, contacted customer support, an update came out and fixed my issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have this phone but I didn't get it for the cyber Monday price Amazon had it at, I bought this one for my daughter, great price a steal really, thank you for these deals Amazon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es bueno el teléfono lo que me debe son las fotos a veces no salen bien de ahí todo fluido aunque le falta cierta aplicación como ejemplo poder grabar la conversación"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have an issue with touching the screen too. I always miss calls due the touch phone doesn't work when I try to answer the phone. Thought that my finger touched or swipe not correctly. Now just reading the one-star rating seeing that others have the same problem. Supposed to return it, but the window return is passed a few days. What's a bumper!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I have to agree with you all on Samsung. I've also been A fan of them I recently had the 10SE for 24 months they offered A trade . I got the phone. It's not charging and the phone is burning my hand. I feel within the past several prior to COVID-19 Samsung has gone down hill in their product's. So I have agree don't waste your money on this new S21FE either it came out on the 12 my birthday and I'm very disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I liked what it provided and is a great phone for my needs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have use galaxy's for years, this was the worst I have encountered and am going to Iphone. Lots of Bugs, fragile as an icicle.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I already had this phone for my wife and it was incredible i am getting this same phone for myself and for such a phone it only costs 600 bucks which is amazing and 128gb is enough storage."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My girlfriend loves it, it's probably the best phone she's ever had. Everything on this FE is amazing the Face recognition is on point, fingerprint reader is fast as he'll and you can store up to three fingers which is awesome. The battery life is well you know it's pretty much the same as all Samsung devices. But all and all it is a great phone and the price you can not beat. I the S21 and the S20 FE is just as good as mine."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The battery life is the reason I bought a new phone. So far, this is lasting two days on one 100% charge. Not to mention all the other great features."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great Camera and memory and storage for many files"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got the phone july 5th. I haven't even had it a month yet and this morning when I plugged the phone in to charge it started smoking and the charging port on the phone now smells burnt. They refunded me my money but now I have to try to find a phone for the same price. I don't understand why they couldn't just send me a replacement phone. Huge inconvenience and now I have no phone until I buy a new one since I can't charge this one."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great phone. Very pleased."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Bought to replace Samsung S8. well constructed and the cameras are fantastic. Wish it were smaller like the S8 it replaced. Unless you have a purse, it is too large to carry around in pockets"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.Second Update (March 18th 2021) Nothing much to add about the phone. My original opinion still stands. The fingerprint scanner can be a pain sometimes but works the majority of the time. Samsung has been doing a good job updating this phone too. I just wish this phone had a headphones jack (at least it has expandable storage)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love the phone. I am having some issues with carrying it in my back pocket, the screen doesn't want to work for a few minutes. And when I try to scroll, it clicks on things."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Needed to upgrade from my S9. This had everything I needed and didn't cost $1000. Got it on Prime day for less than $400"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No issues, will update if anything pops up"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The camera quality is super!! I am still getting used to the phone. Learning a new phone is tough for those of us over 60."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just Got My Samsung Galaxy S20 FE yesterday and I open and tested it if it is a good phone....it is a nice looking phone, but the problem is it was heating up and drained the battery to fast.....only 4/5 hrs of use time at fully charge!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","NA"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Its not cheap but its the best phone I've ever had. It works great with zero issues and works perfectly with my Samsung smart watch."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Nothing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Everything is as it should be. Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I previously used the A71 4G (international version) and loved that phone. However, it had severe signal problems after I moved to a new area, so I started looking for a US version 5G phone. I was considering the A71 5G or the new A52, but I couldn't find one unlocked that would arrive quickly enough. Then I remembered this phone and boom...exactly what I needed, and for just a bit more money than the A52. I don't absolutely need flagship specs, but I must say that I'm enjoying the upgrade from my A71. Everything works flawlessly and fast. Camera is excellent. I do miss the headphone jack, but I got an adapter that works fine. If you're buying unlocked, I think this is a better deal than a new A-series Galaxy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","waited forever for this phone to go on sale. Finally bought it on black friday. However, the phone i received was clearly an opened box: screen plastic film was the wrong fit, the box seal was not original, the wire was not in a tight bundle.Be careful with Amazon, it is starting to ship opened box/returned items as new items!!! I just cant believe that they are doing this with high value items such as cell phones now... extremely disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buen hecho, detalles hermosos ,su función bajo el agua es muy útil.Bastante rápido no se me ha congelado ni una vez en 3 semanas de uso recomendado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This is an incredible cell phone (but for me I came from a much worse cell phone), its construction, its screen, its fluidity, everything was incredible... until the big bugs began, I don't know why I experience so many bugs in apps like YouTube and some games, I do not know if it is a factory error or what, but in the cameras I notice a small fluff that is in a camera (it does not bother the camera) and I already confirmed it and it is not a scratch or a stain that can clean."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn't get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it. The box was closed with tape but very loosely. As well as there being dust inside the box when opening it. Kind of suspect in my opinion. But only time will tell I guess."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","First off, love this phone. Works great for all my needs, and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service, I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home, I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there, but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability, including the gurrilla glass- I still can't believe I'm typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this phone! It works well and would suggest to anyone to buy it. The flat glass is a good improvement over the curved glass of the last one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excellent phone for about 450 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No where does the description of this phone say it is a used or referbished phone. This seems to be a bait n switch deal! Very shaddy to not put in the add that its a used or referbished phone!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","My SO has been a longtime iPhone user and wanted to try something new. I as an Android person suggested this phone as a good place to start and she hasn't put it down (mostly because she is learning the ropes). Otherwise, it is quite a capable phone. She loves taking pictures and this has the dual Sim/Micro SD slot so I put in enough extra memory that she will be taking pictures for quite some time. Battery life is great and the big hang she loves about it is the quality of pictures it can take. I will definitely be looking for an upgrade along this line of phone in the future."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Just works as it is advertise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have no clue what items the phone is supposed to ship with. I was surprised that this was a used (Amazon terminology is renewed) phone and the price was almost that of a new phone. I don't use fingerprint readers nor face recognition. I have no idea about the battery as it is a used phone (maybe the battery is OK). I had to Google search to find out where the SD card went. I chose the S20 instead of an S21 for the SD card slot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have had the phone for about two weeks. After waiting on TCL 10l 5G, Oneplus Nord (that didn't launch state side)_, and Google Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 I had to jump on on this phone. I was able to get the phone for $100 less then Pixel 5 with a stronger processor by preordering the phone. Another plus is I also got a $70 Samsung gift card for preordering the phone. This is my 3rd Samsung phone since the S3. Sadly their phone were getting too expensive with only two years worth of updates.The Positive: The phone comes with the latest flagship processor,120 hz display, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, and at least 3 years of updates. It comes with fast wireless charge, power share, the underside doesn't feel cheap, and battery last me the whole day between work and playing games. ""The 1st thing that came to mind when I turned the phone on was how I have been missing out on how beautiful Samsung's amoled screens are on.""The bad: It comes with gorilla glass 3 I would invest in a screen protector. The phone doesn't come with a 25w super fast charger I guess to keep the cost and it is missing a USB c to c cable to transfer data. (the 15W fast charger it comes with takes about 1hr 30 mins to fully charge my phone while the $12 super charge I bought of Amazon takes exactly 1 hr to charge my phone to 100% Another negative for me is Samsung UI which will delay Android 11. My second thought after 1 hour was ""I don't miss Samsung horrible UI and I would prefer a more vanilla android experience."" I really shouldn't have to use a second launcher like Nova to customize my phone.Overall: This phone is feature proof with 5G (won't be viable for another 3 years) and 3 years worth of updates. I am very excited about the phone and look forward to Samsung releasing more affordable phones with flagship specs in future. Definitely a better value then any other phone on the market if you can live with Samsung UI.Oddity with 5G not the phones fault: I have tested 5G and 4G on T-Mobile network and for some odd reason I get half the speed 4G gives me. (5G is definitely still in its infant stage and don't expect any real speed differences to come until 2022 with 2025 being reality.)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So, I have had many wireless phones over the years; I actully worked for Sprint back when PCS was first starting, and this is the first time I have ever purchased a phone from some place other than a brick and mortar store. The phone worked great and the transfer of pictures, text and apps went without a hitch. I took the SIM card out of my old phone and put it in this phone and the only problem I have is that my car still thinks it is the old phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was seating on the curb and my phone fell out of my pocket crashing screen. It was less than 1 feet height!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","GOOOD"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like everything on it, excellent flagship smartphone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Purchased this for my nephew, he really, really is enjoying it… great camera!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I did some research on the S20 vs the S21. The reviews were accurate. Although its not the latest Samsung product, the S20 is just as good as the S21. For my needs, the differences were minor and the refurbished price was too good to be true."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Best phone I've got for a good price every thing about is worth each penny. The plastic back doesn't feel cheap. I can actually get a grip on it with out a case not like other phones with glass all over that slip off my hand consistently"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone! Had S8+ for 5 years and have to say with the exception of a few sensors and appearance this phone is great for less than half the cost ! Bought one for my wife and after 5 months of her using it and needing to replace my old phone I purchased one. Very happy with it and look forward to years of service from it !!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I got this phone to keep up with the technology of the cell phones. My S7 just got too slow and too outdated. It still works but it won't be long before it can't be updated or supported by the newest versions.I like everything about it. Much faster for streaming. Pro camera for pictures and video with editing. Lots more memory. Etc."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So far, I really like it. Some features are taxing my nerves, but I expected that since I am technology challenged. It was easy to change from my old galaxy and still have everything I had before, only better and more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","It's everything I wanted and I'm very happy with it. I have not been happy with the A51 I've been using and I'm thrilled that this phone works more like the old Galaxy that I had except better!! It is also compatible with the Consumer Cellular network and I had no issues getting hooked up. It's nice that it comes with the tool to remove a sim card."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Was an ordered item as per family members requirements."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Security , battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Cameras - check, with good zoom up to 10x (more is so-so).Battery life - check, with 2 days of use.Screen - check, gorgeous AMOLED with fast refresh rate.Fast CPU - check, Snapdragon 865, games are flying.Carrier LTE compatibility - check, see kimovil website.Brand name - check, Samsung FTW.Friendly price - check!Anti-bloatware - check, see xda website.???Profit!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The voice quality is very clear and the two buttons works well. The screen size fits me well. The picture quality is great. I need some time to get used to the screen unlock gesture because it seems to be easily confused with the camera function. I have also been directed to Samsung Pay without intention of using it. Overall, I think I have made the right choice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono es bueno pero antes del mes se daño el sistema de carga y en vez de cambiar todo el teléfono… cambiaron solo el sistema de carga… creo q si algo no está funcionando bien. Deberían cambiarlo por uno nuevo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Shipping was very fast! I see another of customers are talking about the sim card not included, but it says in the print! Very simple to purchase the sim card anywhere you're activating the phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Estoy muy contenta con mi nuevo samsung S20 FE 5G pero hay algo que no encontre en la caja donde venia y es muy importante para mi: LA GARANTIA."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Replaced a S8. Transfer was quick and features are good. Battery life is good but not great. Needed 5G capability and larger screen. Unlocked so we have flexibility to shift carrier."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La duración de la batería con lo justo llega a 1 día"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I'm totally happy with this purchase. I haven't had it set up long enough to do face recognition . battery life seems to be OK. The power cord does not work and quick guide is for a different phone but other than that it's great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I was waiting for the Pixel 5 which came out the same time. The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi & cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts & and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts & call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded from the Samsung S8 and this so far has been great. Pictures are crisp and clear, runs quickly. The only thing I found is that the battery life is not all that great but I am also using the phone a lot."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Changed from iPhone SE to this Galaxy20 FE. Very glad I did. I like the larger screen for all of my tasks. Very intuitive, much better than iphones in my opinion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love this new phone. User friendly with great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Liked all the features, still learning about the phone. The shipping and handling had no problems. Very good service."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The phone works, as I am using it right now to leave this review. There have been no issues with functionality and the camera is a major upgrade from my S8! Also, the larger screen is nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","This phone is pretty sick, I came from a galaxy s8 plus 4 gig with an exynos cpu, which had died and wouldn't turn back on. So I decided to just go with this, its fast and has a great display, takes good pics and all that. Its definitely a good bang for your buck. There is something just slightly off about the touch screen its literally nothing big its like my s8nalways hit the numbers to unlock even if I was typing super quick but sometimes this phone will maybe miss a key press but its rare."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Definitely not orange. The orange color option is definitely Pink instead, so thank you for sticking me with a pink phone for the next two years"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like this phone for what it is. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S7 that was on it's last legs. Since I need to have a phone for work, I decided to stay with Samsung as I like their hardware more than any other phone I've tried. I work in IT and I can say that the Samsung phones are pretty reliable and fast. This S20 is no different. The screen is nice, large, and vibrant. My apps are opening very quickly and the battery lasts a lot longer than the older one in my S7 was. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a good phone with nice camera setup and good screen. Make sure to pickup a case for it and you'll be good to go!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I bought this phone for my wife and I have the Galaxy S20+, but besides the screen size we haven't been able to tell a notable difference other than the FE being much more affordable. Having Galaxy phones since 2011, they are the best and will continue being the best over the fruit phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Very nice mobile phone. Easy to set up and use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Not impressed with the battery life otherwise a nice phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I love this phone easy to use an the camera is everything! Battery life is amazing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","great phone for the price that I purchased for new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llevo usándolo por más de dos semanas y no tengo inconveniente alguno. Venía de un S7 Edge y el salto es increible, la batería durá aproximadamente hasta 10 horas de pantalla con mi uso normal, la fluidez de pantalla en los 120 Hz se nota y hace que en general se sienta mucho más veloz toda la interfaz y el uso de aplicaciones.Para mí no es problema que la parte de atrás sea de plástico ya que me parece que aún así se siente muy bien a la mano y no pierde el aspecto de celular premium, además que es más resistente que el cristal a las caídas.Tiene carga inalambrica, carga reversible y un cargador de carga rápida de 15W, que podría incluirse el de 25W en la caja ya por el precio, pero tampoco es demasiado drama. Las cámaras están muy bien en definición y calidad y en general es un gran teléfono para uso diario. Recomendado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it - clash of clans works perfect on it. It is hard to talk to people on it sometime bc they cant hear me but its due to the water proof case. Its run very good since I got it a few months ago. Can't complain"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","ProsThe phone is quick loading appsDual speakers instead of one speakerFinger print scanner and face rec have worked without issueConsConsidering what is available nowadays the camera quality is mediocre. Should have just put a better main camera and deleted the 30x zoom lense that's just too pixelated for distance shots.Battery life barely makes it through a day even with the phone on medium power saving/disabled app background usage. (Battery drained 10% in 10 hours overnight while not even being used)No port for headphone.Overall I could have gotten a cheaper phone and lived without things like face rec and in screen finger print scanner, wireless charging, etc. Would prefer better battery life and better camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Esta divino"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I've had this phone (S20 FE 5G UW) for 20 months so far and it's as good as new. Camera is really great. The processor is as fast as a flagship phone of 2021. My favorite feature is the battery. It will easily exceed 24-36 hours between charges with normal use. The superfast charge will go from 0% to 100% in under 90 minutes. I really have no complaints about this superb phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Ya casi 2 meses de usarlo funciona perfecto, cumpliendo con todos los estándares de un celular de esta gama. El único pero que le daría seria el peso que lo vuelve un poco incómodo, pero la batería me llega a durar entre un día entero de uso continuo a 2 días de poco uso.Pd: le compre una SD de 500G y funciona perfecto."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I love this phone. The camera system could be the best out presently. The ability to add memory. I can' not imagine what I DON'T yet know about this outstanding phone. The reception and clarity are great. Noise and dropouts have yet to happen. This is a very fast operating phone. The sound is great. Got mine on sale for $599.99 (Amazon) and could not be happier. Amazon is an authorized seller. Avoid 3rd party's if you want the warranty intact. Contact any dealer before you buy to be certain the phone is new and under full warranty. Samsung can also answer this. Be sure to put a good protective cover on it. Also. Some complain that when they install a screen protector the tough sensitivity and fingerprint ID don't work well. There is a simple menu setting to adjust touch sensitivity under SETTING's. This solves the issue. Even without a case, this is a well built phone. But use a lanyard so if you do drop it, it won't hit the ground. Best phone out there for the money. 5g ready and acts as a hot pot too."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I upgraded (?) from the Samsung S9. I've only had this phone for a few weeks, but here are my first impressions. Looks like I'm going to have to spring for another set of $100 + for Bluetooth headphones since this phone doesn't have an audio port for them. I often use headphones for an extend period of time. When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings. Other than that, it's a decent phone. I may just keep it until I find something that fits my needs better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I have bought it at Thanksgiving. Everything in the phone make me happy but delivery. I received it 8th Dec. I knew that it was a pre-order but delivery was later than expected."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","As advertised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","I like the bigger screen. I was worried about no phone jack but I bought a really cool wireless headphones set and it's actually better. I bought the Tracfone Sim Kit so that was a super easy process. Definitely recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Amazing phone for the price.I would say price per feature this is the best deal I have ever got on a phone in my life. Upgrading from an s8+ I wouldn't know what could possibly even be better on the s21 models that just came out.I used to be all about the latest phones but it gets tiresome after a while. If you are looking for a cheap phone without sacrificing anything in terms of quality.. This is the phone for you. Amazing speed, amazing pictures, fast and snappy."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Keyboard disappears here and there and you have to relaunch it somehow.I guess it's a matter of getting used the phone is all. Updated to Android 12 on 2/5/2022The battery life is just average, but that depends on how you use your phone, how much you doing the internet, downloading, etc.Otherwise, it's a really nice phone and I'm really happy with it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Great cameras, great display, fast UI, good sound, etc. Wife loves it and it is a big upgrade from Huwei Mate SE. Battery life is good and everything seems to work well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","So I got this phone around 12pm, activated it with tmobile around 2. Got a screen and case for the thing. First review was in regards to the box not being wrapped and there was ALOT of dust on the screen. If the phone is new why is there dust and a thin screen protector thats slapped on sideways. Fortunately for these folks I already did to much to the phone to want to go that far to return. however I would of returned based on the face I just spent from 4pm to now at 8pm trying to successfully update my phone. This is my SECOND S20FE and im very technology savvy. For I use to work for Apple, but I prefer galaxy all the way. But why do I have a brand new phone and I have to to through articles hard resets, updating over and over again just for it to tell me its not updated again! Well finally at 8pm and me not giving up not wanting to have to return the phone I finally was able to successfully update the phone. I called Amazon HELP and they hung up on me. All the way I want to give the phone amazon and SAMSUNG 2 STARS 1 star because I still love galaxy and the other star for my self I guess cause no help from amazon or samsung I fixed it myself. Oh and im also very upset that u locked samsung phones don't have the read receipt feature have to download messages and that even took me another half hour reading articles and discovered on the forum I had to download the carrier services app to even be able to use messages chat features. Even though it says my phone should be compatible to use at this point im just tired....I'll end up buying another phone down the line but right now I don't have time and I guess ill just be grateful for the time being.... will NEVER order from samsung again I guess to get all features you have to be a SLAVE to a carrier!!!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Beautiful phone! I Love the pictures it takes. It has a very nice big screen for watching videos and movies.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inalámbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, batería 4500 mha, Cargador ""mexicano"" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro 😊. No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión, pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería, nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado, en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería, llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseñas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras, el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los años, yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 años, siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos años este es tu opción ideal, no te vas arrepentir."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Antes que nada deben revisar cual es el vendedor porque para este teléfono hay como 5 o mas proveedores, en la foto aparece el color azul pero a mi me llego uno color rosa, la verdad no me molesta pero si es un punto a considerar.La funcionalidad es buena, la cámara también es bastante buena, creo que en general cumple las expectativas excepto por la bateria, la bateria le dura poco en realidad, buscando en internet al parecer esto es normal, no solo en este Samsung S20 Fe sino en otros modelos del mismo Samsung, te da aprox 6 a 7 horas de pantalla activa con los HZ en 60, para 1 día alcanza bien pero creo que todos esperamos mas siendo este un modelo 2020"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llego el pedido relativamente rápido en menos de una semana, todo bien hasta el momento espero no encontrar alguna falla y devolverlo, hasta ahorita va bien si es nuevo eso parece (venia en su caja) , en fin todo bien, el único problema es la batería no dura casa nada , en primer lugar tarda casi 2 horas para cargar a 100% en cuanto lo prendes la batería se empieza a desplomar y eso me desánimo mucho, tenia muchas expectativas de este celular, la verdad la bateria🔋 si es un aspecto de gran relevancia para mí"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo malo es que no es tan rápido en respuesta 😅 Muy bonitas imágenes de captura de la cámaraSi lo recomiendo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Recien lo compre y el telefono llego en buen estado y conforme a las caracteristicas mencionadas en la publicacion, probe con dos sims distintas las cuales fueron Telcel y AT&T y funcionaron sin problemas el unico problema es que el cargador llego de la version europea pero con un adaptador no hay problema y respeta su carga rapida."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","The media could not be loaded.
 El teléfono llegó super rápido y lo compré por un excelente precio $13,500 más o menos.

La pantalla es muy buena y no le pide nada a los otros modelos s20. En tanto a la pantalla lo único que me ha pasado es que un par de veces después de desbloquearlo no reconoce mis gestos o cuando toco la pantalla en algunas partes, desconozco el por qué. Fuera de eso me funciona de maravilla la respuesta tanto que juego COD mobile.

El sonido es muy bueno porque tiene un par de bocinas con sonido estéreo que te hacen tener una gran experiencia al consumir contenido multimedia.

Los métodos de seguridad funcionan bien, nada del otro mundo pero bien. Sigo prefiriendo el lector de huella físico que el que tiene integrado pero tarda un par de segundos en responder. El desbloqueo facial es bueno pero podría ser mejor.

Las cámaras soy muy buenas y puedes grabar a 60 fps en 4k, en esta configuración no tiene estabilización pero para una toma estática va de maravilla. La cámara frontal es muy buena y reconoce el rostro para saber si tiene que ampliar la toma en dado caso que detecte dos rostros.

La batería, 45000 mAh dan super bien para un día de uso empezando desde las 8 AM hasta al rededor de las 10 de la noche cuando ya estás en casa y lo puedes comenzar a cargar. El cargador que viene de fábrica en mi caso fue el tipo americano de 15w y carga suficientemente rápido. Lo anterior con la pantalla a 60 Hz. No he podido probar la pantalla un día completo o una carga completa en 120 Hz.

El rendimiento es bueno, 6 gb de ram son buenos aunque con 8 sería perfecto. Aún así el snapdragon hace un gran trabajo en el rendimiento, no se traba jugando o navegando, no se calienta por el uso, claro siempre y cuando le des un uso normal.

Los contras que le encuentro al teléfono es que sí extraño el Jack de 3.5 mm para los auriculares, tengo que ocupar unos Bluetooth que tengo. Es difícil encontrar accesorios cheveres y una mica específica para la pantalla porque aún es un teléfono relativamente nuevo. Quiero resaltar que aun con una mica de cristal templado lee bien mi huella pero el cristal que conseguí no le quedó a la perfección aún así el chiste es que lo proteja.

Los pros o puntos a favor son demasiados por todo el extra que ofrece además de las cosas buenas que ya mencione. Samsung te ofrece grandes cosas como la carga reversible e inalambrica, filtro de luz azul (es buenísimo para la vista y lo recomiendo), conexión a Windows (tiene alianza con Windows haciendo que sea muy fácil vincular el teléfono con un equipo de computo Windows y poder recibir notificaciones, hacer llamadas, transmitir la pantalla del teléfono en la computadora, etc), Dex (vuelve tu teléfono como una laptop), puedes grabar la pantalla del teléfono directamente desde los accesos directos y la barra edge deslizando desde un costado de la pantalla, también se ilumina el borde de la pantalla con las notificaciones que configures entre muchas cosas más. Es una gran opción y lo recomiendo."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sí, este equipo cuenta con el procesador Snapdragon 865 y con 5G, lo pedí directamente a Amazon México y viene con un cargador de 15W dentro de la caja.
Pedí el color lavanda y aunque un sector se quejó de que la tapa es de plástico ni siquiera se nota, al tacto se siente de un material muy bueno y semi premium que le queda excelente y el color lavanda se ve hermoso.
Ahora hablando del rendimiento, es muy potente. Me corre juegos pesados con una fluidez que asombra, no he tenido ningún problema de sobrecalentamiento y las pocas veces que aumentó su temperatura, bajó muy rápido.
La batería, dependiendo del uso que le des y la fluidez que tengas activada en la pantalla (120 hz o 60hz), puede variar entre 7 y hasta 10 horas de pantalla, en mi caso es suficiente para llegar al final del día (siempre tengo encendidos los 120Hz y hasta el Bluetooth y la batería no se drena rápido).
La cámara trasera es muy buena para foto y video, aunque la frontal para selfies pudo ser mejor, pero no me quejo mucho ya que hace un trabajo aceptable.
Sin duda es el mejor celular que he tenido."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Tiene el procesador Snapdragon, es 5g, llegó con cable y cargador"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sin detalles negativos, estoy satisfecho con la compra pues si tiene el procesador snapdragon, no tuve ningún problema con el proveedor de red"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La batería es patética. El teléfono sí llega nuevo y con el estado de la batería al 100, es solo que el manejo de la batería del propio teléfono es ridículamente malo. Sí la autonomía no es problema para ti,compralo. Sí no puedes estar cargando lo cada 5 horas, busca otra opción."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es una buena opcion ahun en 2022. Pues este modelo cuenta con el procesador Snapdragon 865 por lo tanto soporta 5G. Una de las cosas que mas analice fue la calidad de las camaras y a pesar de q son de 12MPx la calidad es muy superior que las de 48MPx, analice esto a profundidad y puedo decir que valio la pena. Cuenta con carga inalambrica y es sumergible al agua por 30 mins max a una prof de 1.5mts. Tamien trae la opcion de desbloqueo por huella dijital el cual funciona bien a secas, mientras el desbloqueo por reconocimiento facial es muy rapido. El audio me parecio muy bueno mas no se porque dice q es stereo si solo cuenta con 1 orificio de la bocina... El unico inconveniente es que trae Gorila Glass 3 asi q te recomiendo q le pongas un protector de pantalla para minimizar el que se rompa en una caida.
Yo lo compre en Abril del 2022 por 10,100 pesos Mx."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Un excelente teléfono. Llego el que pedí, antes de la fecha programada de entrega. Galaxy S20 FE Es la versión 5G aunque en mi región no hay 5G, con snapdragon, y funciona perfectamente con el chip de Telcel en México. Viene en su caja normal sellado, su cable USB y cargador, y trae su pinchito, pero no trae funda.
Ya tengo una semana usándolo y sin problema, lo que note es que el consumo de la batería es mas que el anterior que tenia el Galaxy A71, y lo que extraño es que no trae entrada para audífono 3.5, ahora tendré que comprar un adaptador para grabar los videos con micrófono de solapa.
Su costo fue de 11999 pesos mexicanos y tenia la opción de pagar con tarjeta a meses sin intereses."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","me llego con 15% de bateria, en lo que se configuraba se quedo en 3%, lo cargue al 100%, despues de 1 hora de solo usar instagram me queda en 65% solo usando instagram! no me imagino usando juegos o aplicaciones"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Mi celular pasado era un Xiaomi, con las mismas características de almacenamiento 6GB y 128GB, solo que el Snapdragon de este samsung es de 865, y la verdad no siento el cambio sustancial en cuanto al rendimiento, se siente igual de rápido. Puedo decir que no siento que sea de mejor calidad este Samsung que un Xiaomi con las mismas características.
Otra cosa es la cámara, las selfies di mi otro cel tenía 20MP de la cámara frontal y éste es de 32MP, hice la comparación de las tomas y me gustaban más como salían en mi Xiaomi.
Lo que no le discuto a este cel es la cámara trasera, es buena, pero se calienta muchísimo el teléfono al usar la cámara.
Para terminar, siento que la pila no me dura mucho ni por que le activé el modo de ahorro de energía y tampoco uso el cel para jugar, no tengo ningún juego en mi cel.
Y por el precio, la verdad me ubiera comprado otro xiaomi con mejor rendimiento, pero quise probar el samsung por sus cámaras y la verdad es que no vale la pena por la cámara. Quise regresar el cel pero en Amazon decía que este producto no era elegible para devolución.
Otro punto malo es que no tiene grabador de voz, tuve que bajar una aplicación gratis que tiene muchos anuncios buuu. Estoy decepcionada de este cel."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me frustra no poder activar la doble sim. Tengo otros celulares con doble sim. Y jamás me había ""roto"" la cabeza tratando de solucionar este problema. Aún sin lograr solucionar. Por lo demás totalmente satisfecho. Espero alguién pueda ayudarme con algún secreto o truco para solucionar este problema."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llegó super rápido, a pesar de que fue traído desde Estados Unidos, todo bien sellado, si me llegó con el procesador Snapdragon 865 que es la versión 5GSuper recomendado 👌🏻"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hace 5 días me llego mi Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. Me quede impresionado ya que llego antes de lo esperado. Llego el equipo en buenas condiciones y totalmente sellado, con su cargador y su cable. Decidí comprar este producto liberado ya que según tengo entendido viene con la versión de Snapdragon. Al venir de un celular de huawei (y al no tener acceso a las aplicaciones de Google) opte por comprar un Samsung de tal manera que ya habia tenido Galaxy S3 hace bastantes años. Estoy fascinado con su pantallas amoled (característico de Samsung) su calidad de imagen y video, sin olvidar su fluidez ya que cuenta con 120hz (ajustable a 60hz). Me encuentro satisfecho con la compra, sin embargo, el unico ""pero"" que le pongo es... He leído otros comentarios que hablan de un ""buen rendimiento'' y sinceramente por horario de trabajo le he dado un uso básico, visitas a redes sociales espontáneas durante el día. Siendo ya la 5 pm tengo menos de un 55% de bateria tomando en cuenta que casi no lo uso en horario de trabajo. Mi experiencia con Samsung siempre su batería es mala y alargo plazo tiendes a fallar mucho sus baterías (experiencia a equipos anteriores). Quisiera saber si alguien más le ha pasado? Ya que he leído buenos comentarios de su rendimiento."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llevo aproximadamente dos semanas usándolo y me encanta! No soy de jugar muchos videojuegos por lo que el procesador Exynos no es un problema para mi. Llegó en buenas condiciones y funciona excelente. 100% recomendado"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El celular no defrauda realmente, cumple con todas tus espectativas es muy potente y eficiente, se siente el poder de su procesador snapdragon 865 y la eficiencia de la batería es formidable te dura todo 1 jornada laboral de 8 horas sin ningún problema llegas a tu casa fácilmente con el 30 a 35% de batería con un uso frecuente del dispositivo durante el día. te permite saltar de aplicacion en aplicacion rápidamente y navegar por ellas sin qué el dispositivo se alente en ningún momento, se calienta muy poco a excepción de los juegos ahí suele subir considerablemente su temperatura pero no es de una manera exagerada. Las cámaras son excelentes y cuentan con una resolución e interpretación de colores muy balanceados y el modo noche es una maravilla las fotos en cuartos muy oscuros las saca tan claras como si fuera de día.Pero como dije el celular no decepciona el qué decepciona es el estado en el qué lo envían, ya que desde que habres la caja te das cuenta que no protegen de movimientos o golpes bruscos a la caja del dispositivo qué viene dentro y va totalmente suelto. De ahí una vez qué sacas tu articulo te das cuenta que ya ha sido habierto ya que la caja dónde viene el celular no traía los sellos oficles de Samsung, si no más bien un sello común y corriente que puedes conseguir en una papelería, una vez que rompes dichos sellos y abres la caja para ver tu celular y revisas los documentos que suelen traer un celular ""nuevo"" te das cuenta qué la garantía del dispositivo no viene dentro, reafirmando una vez más que la caja fue abierta antes. Después de 20 días de uso del celular el botón de BLOQUEO/ENCENDIDO, se comienza aflojar y se termina cayendo dejando al botón incerbible. y sin la hoja de garantía dentro de la caja te ponen en un grave predicamento ya que no puedes exigirle una garantía a Samsung porque no cuentas con la hoja. afortunadamente ésto me sucedió antes de cumplirse el mes de oportunidad que te da Amazon para regresarlo y pude devolver el equipó pidiendo mi reembolso, pero si esto hubiera pasado después del mes y sin la hoja de la garantía del celular hubiera tirado 14 mil pesos a la basura. Revisen bien como llega el celular y chequen si su articulo lleva la garantía y si no es así usen y pongan aprueba su celular de manera intesa para detectar los defectos rápidamente y estén a tiempo de pedir el reembolso de su dinero."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Samsung es garantía para celulares. Bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lamentablemente el teléfono viene bloqueado por AT&T, no es desbloqueado de fábrica, incluso cuando lo traté de desbloquear en el portal de AT&T, me sale un mensaje que tiene plan y no se ha pagado.El vendedor me atendió y aunque le envié imágenes y datos no resolvió el problema, fue atento y amable, me ofreció regresarlo para reembolso. No lo regresé porque aunque no actualiza android ni UI por el bloqueo, todo lo demás funciona bien, es muy buen equipo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Vengo de un S8 y buscaba actualizarme, opte por éste modelo pues viene con procesador snapdragon y compatibilidad 5g, ya que en México en tiendas oficiales solo distribuyen la versión 4g, además de la posibilidad de expansión de memoria por medio de micro SD tiene excelente rendimiento, es muy veloz y con excelente respuesta táctil, la calidad de las cámaras no le pide nada a los modelos más recientes, la batería me rinde todo el día a pesar de pasar buen tiempo entre diversas aplicaciones, excelente compra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es muy buen teléfono, si llegó la versión correcta (versión 5G con procesador snapdragon) pero claramente fue usado porque el número de IMEI SV no estaba en 00 o 01, estaba en 20. (Esto significa que no es nuevo). Además, llegó en una caja sin los sellos originales. También, la batería sólo le dura 6 horas, si no te molesta llevar un power bank contigo a todos lados, es una buena compra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Opté por este modelo 5G para reemplazar un S8+, el tamaño es el mismo y funciona bien, pero opté por el S20 y no el S21 porque había visto que esta era la última versión con expansión de memoria mediante tarjeta micro SD, y resulta que ya no tiene la expansión, solo se puede agregar la tarjeta SIM."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El celular es de lo mejor en el mercado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El producto llega cerrado, completamente nuevo y en mi caso, justo como lo pedí. Tardó muy poco el envío aunque para el precio, esperaba que se sintiera de mejor calidad el acabado del celular, pero es más cuestión de gustos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Soy usuaria convencida de SAMSUNG desde hace muchos años, y nunca había tenido uno con tan mala recepción de señal telefónica."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Calidad y precio"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me gustó qué trae procesador snapdragon, los materiales y sobre todo el precio, lo que no me gusto fue qué en la publicación decía 8 gb en Ram y trae 6 Gb.

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Mi primer celular Samsung y todo de maravilla, la carga es no tan rápida pero suficiente para mí, los juegos cómo COD y PUBG Mobile me los corre en ultra HD, me da 6 horas de juego continuo en 120Hz, la cámara es muy buena, según escuché que es la misma que la del Samsung galaxy s20 Ultra, no se calienta tanto cómo había escuchado incluso siendo Snapdragon."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo compré cuando aparecía a la venta con Samsung USA, la verdad estoy complacido, ya que el color era el que quería y se siente tan bien. Además ésta versión era la versión 5G lo cuál me deja aún más contento, sé que en México aún no tenemos red 5G pero al menos estar preparado para cuando ocurra es lo ideal.Lamento mucho que Samsung México no lo venda en versión 5G.La duda de muchos es si funciona con las redes de México y la respuesta es sí, viene desbloqueado de fábrica y a mi me funciona muy bien, tengo un chip de Telcel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Realmente ha sido el mejor telefono que me he comprado, incluso mejor que los iphone, en lo personal pase muchos años con iphones, pero cambie a telefonos android desde que Apple aumento sus precios.Este Galaxy S20 FE, tiene varias ventajas, llevo dos semanas con el telefono y funciona perfectamente, me permite accesar a el desde mi PC contestar mensajes y llamadas sin problema de conexion entre PC y telefono, toma muy buenas fotos, el modo noche sobre todo funciona bien.El modo escritorio del telefono es perfecto para quienes trabajamos en la PC diario, facilitandonos utilizar recursos que tenemos en nuestro telefono desde la PC.En resumen vale la pena el telefono."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El equipo es increíble! De muy buena calidad y ofrece buenísimas prestaciones, es fluido y rápido además de que su cámara es idéntica a la de un S20+ solo que con menos zoom (lo cual ni utilizas tanto realmente). Es la mejor manera de adquirir este equipo por qué en México solo venden la versión 4G y con exynos :( pero este equipo es la mejor versión (5G y snapdragon) y tiene una gran diferencia de precio (yo ahorre más de 4 mil pesos a diferencia de comprarlo en México) El equipo viene sellado y súper cuidado, sin duda la mejor manera de comprarlo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Dice navy blue pero es lila. Si es 5G. La ranura para SIM y memoria extraible es la misma"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","este celular me encantó, tiene casi todo lo que un S20 normal tendría, aunque bajaron unas cosillas para mantener un precio algo más económico, pero eso no significa que sea menos, ya que mantiene un excelente rendimiento en su software (con el procesador qualcomm) y en cuanto a fotos/videos, han salido muy buenas tomas a mi parecerlo recomiendo muchísimo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me gusto, la rapidez con la que llego el telefono antes de la fecha programada, sin embargo creo que el sonido al tener una llamada y poner el speaker es muy bajo, anteriormente tenia un S10e, y tenia mejor sonido, el telefono es rapido, considero que si el telefono esta diseñado para FAN de samsung, debio incluir audifonos, aunque se incremente un poco el precio, se me hace muy básico, creo que definitivamente hubiera elegido el S20 Plus, es mucho mejor,y la diferencia no es mucha, creo que le falto un poco en lo estetico y accesorios, es muy muy básico, solo telefono cargador."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Hace unos meses compré el S20 plus con exynos y debo decir que ese celular es una basura. La batería le duraba 8 horas en uso normal! Y 4 horas de pantalla encendida. Entonces lo devolví y ahorita compré este celular el S20 FE 5G con snapdragon y es muy diferente, la batería le dura como 20 horas de uso normal y 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida (eso sí, le dura eso con los 120hrz de pantalla apagados) pero estoy satisfecho con mi compra. Juego PUBG y COD durante dos horas y no se calienta casi. Entonces si lo recomiendo, llevo como 2 meses con el"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono tiene buenas características de un gama alta y no le pide mucho al S20 normal, la cámara es muy buena, la pila si dura mucho lo único que flaquea un poco es la pantalla, que aunque es muy buena la del tope de gama es superior, no me arrepiento de la compra porque la relación precio calidad vale mucho la pena"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es bueno, so far so good. La version de snapdragon es brutal, la batería me aguanta el día entero aún en 120Hz. Lo único malo es que en dos ocasiones el display touch, no me reconoce el dedo en ciertas zonas de la pantalla, creo es un problema de software, habrá que esperar a que lo arreglen los de samsung. Fuera de eso, estoy maravillado con el celular."

Pasé de un Galaxy S8 y la mejora en rendimiento, batería y cámara es notable, antes llegaba a casa con mínimo de batería o en ocasiones se me apagaba, ahora llego con 50-40%. El pero que le ponen muchos revisores es la cubierta posterior de plástico pero con una buena funda ni lo notas y el color es muy agradable.
Excelente celular hasta ahora."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llego sellado y si funciona con chip de Mexico, de hecho, en la caja dice que esta desbloqueado por Samsung.
Apenas llevo 1 día con el y me ha resultado bien, el envío no tardo mucho en llegar, llegó en 3 días.
Muy seguro, aunque también se le debería comprar una funda porque no viene incluída en la caja, pero fuera de eso todo bien."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente calidad del equipo, el único inconveniente es que al ser importado fue abierto en aduanas al llegar al México. Pero comprendo totalmente que no fue problema del vendedor. A pesar de que llego abierto con todo el contenido suelto fuera de la caja del samsung todo llego en buen estado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Celular en perfecto estado, solo el embalaje no muy bueno, pero todo bien. Algo tardado para recibir el producto, tal vez por las distancias de lugar a lugar."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El celular vino en caja cerrada completamente nuevo, me ah funcionado sin ningun problema y es original con snapdragon y el 5g, aunque en Mexico no tenemos aún línea 5g ya está preparado para recibirlo, me ah funcionado con telcel y AT&T sin problema"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No me gustó que me msndaran un cargador donde en México. No se usa esos contactos. Así mismo no viene los auriculares"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No venía sellado pero supongo que porque la aduana abrió el paquete, el teléfono si es el correcto y funciona perfectamente hasta el momento."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo necesitaba con snapdragon como dice en las receñas y viene con exynos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llego en buen estado y tiempo pero según esto era el s20 fe 5g con procesador snapdragon y me llego con versión éxynos 4g . Pongan bien sus anuncios aló que venden
Ya no lo pude devolver por que fue un regalo . Y ni modo de quitarselo ala persona que lo tiene"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Se tardo mucho en llegar, tardo en salir de aduana y llego sin audífonos, de ahi en fuera excelente equipo totalmente nuevo, sellado"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Sin problemas con el paquete, venía totalmente sellado y va a la perfección. Recomendado por el precio de la versión snapdragon, está más caro en telcel con todo y que venden la versión exynos ..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono lo he tenido desde enero y debo decir que no me ha decepcionado ni un poco! La cámara es buenísima y no hay fallas con la colectividad celular. 100%recomiendo el teléfono."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es de los teléfonos con mejor relación ""cálidad - precio"", sin embargo tuve que devolverlo, principalmente por sus problemas de toques fantasma en la pantalla, no todos tienen este detalle y en algunos es más evidente que en otros, sin embargo en mi caso fue molesto que al usar 2 o más dedos sobre el teléfono (como al escribir o jugar) de repente se hacen toques no deseados en la pantalla."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El equipo es muy bonito, la verdad no sé siente el acabado de plástico, el rendimiento es muy bueno y las fotos que toma están muy bien, la cámara tiene flexibilidad lo que hace que tengas que aprender varios modos de captura."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono llegó de USA antes de lo esperado.
Aunque no llegó en las mejores condiciones de embalaje, el equipo estaba completamente sellado.
Hasta el momento tiene extraordinario rendimiento, sobre todo con snapdragon.
La batería, genial! tiene larga duración y se carga rapidisimo.
100% recomendable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es un excelente telefono, si ya usaste antes telefonos de la marca samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","no le llega al s20 normal, pero para el precio esta bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Realmente llegó el que pedí, aunque aún no hay 5G en México lo compré por el rendimiento del Snapdragon 865 y del teléfono en general. Sólo lo he usado un día pero se siente excelente y vino bien protegido a pesar de haber salido desde USA, recomendado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Incredible teléfono en relación calidad precios, decidí dejar Apple para probar Android y la verdad el S20FE 5g me dejó más que satisfecho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente, hermoso y muy rápido, cumplió con mis expectativas, ningun problema con la señal en México, desbloqueado y todo perfecto, lamentablemente no trae una funda como la versión que se vende en México, llegó en 5 días desde EUA muy bien empacado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Su carga es demasiado lenta, probé con cargador de realme 6 pero igual carga lentísima más de 2 horas conectado usando el teléfono y no carga ni 80"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El celular funciona muy bien pero venía con un defecto en el botón de encendido que venía flojo y con el tiempo se termino de caer y ya no tengo botón de encendido"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Al principio tenía duda de comprarlo para Mx pero no me arrepiento,
Es un excelente equipo y más por el precio que pagas por el.
No me arrepiento de la compra y funciona al 100%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Lo probé con att y funcionó sin problema alguno, todo es configurable a español. Hasta el momento todo funcionando bien. El 5g es un bonito extra ya qué aun no tenemos redes 5g"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Todo excelente pero venia sin audifonos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente teléfono. Me encanta. El diseño, el hardware y el software son geniales. De las mejores compras que he hecho. Tal vez la unica crítica serían un poco las cámaras. Pero por el precio están bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La entrega fue super rapida, en 3 días estaba en mi casa. Lo pude obtener a un super precio gracias a las ofertas de black friday. Muy recomendado, rápido y con una cámara de gran calidad!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","16 meses de uso del celular y de un día para otro dejo de funcionar el detector de la tarjeta sim, acudí a un centro de atención y me dijeron que quizá lo bloqueo alguien por un reporte de robo, mal y de malas con el celular que me funcionaba bien pero se descompuso como si tuviera fecha de caducidad"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","muy buen producto, cumple con las espectativas, de muy buena calidad. la entrega antes de lo previsto, sin ningún golpe o daño en la caja, todo en orden."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono viene en perfecto estado, la caja en donde lo envían viene un poco grande pero tiene protección de burbujas aparte me llego 2 días antes de lo previsto
Excelente compra 👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El teléfono funciona de maravilla, su diseño es muy elegante y la calidad de las fotografías son excelentes. Estoy muy contento con este dispositivo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llegó super rápido a México , además de tener un buen precio. El celular es excelente, lo que más me encantó fue la cámara. Le doy una calificación de 10."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","En mi caso todavía no cumplo un año con este teléfono Samsung S20 FE 5G y el botón de encendido y apagado ya se desprendió sin motivo. En verdad lo he cuidado mucho de caídas y maltratos, hasta la funda original de Samsung compré para mayor protección, lo que indica que el desperfecto viene de fábrica. Más cuidado aún al comprar la versión de USA porque para la garantía ni Samsung México (fabricante) ni Amazon México (vendedor) se quieren hacer responsables. Quedé muy decepcionado de ambas compañías, no pienso volver a comprar electrónica de Samsung y menos en Amazon México."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","La publicación mencionan que es la 5 G que con Snapdragon así como las reseñas que mencionan que les llegó, pero lamentablemente de mi es la versión e Europea con Movistar por lo que posee Exinos, el equipo me llegó bien solo la molestia es que no sean sinceros o se cuelen para vender versiones que no son, del equipo funciona con los detalles del procesador Exinos que se calienta cuando lo usas, de ahí en fuera todo está bien al parecer con el celular, y la compra pues una gran molestia por dar algo que no pediste, suerte con sus compras y espero que no les hagan perder el tiempo haciendo la devolución del producto"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Funciona perfecto con Telcel en México, buen teléfono de gama alta con buenas capacidades a un precio aceptable. Me llegó en menos de una semana."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llego bien el producto, bien cuidado.. solo que llego abierta la caja del celular pero si incluía todo, esto es cubo de cargador cable y el celular, no así audífonos ni funda."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Llegó antes de la fecha lo cual se agradece, el dispositivo funciona bien, es 5G, procesador Snapdragon,
sin fallas con telcel.
Espero no tener fallas, actualizaré despues de probarlo un tiempo, hasta ahora excelente."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me encantó este celular. Toma fotos muy bonitas, no se calienta para nada y para lo que yo necesito está super. Estoy muy satisfecha."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Es un gran celular, gran procesador, es todo lo que buscaba"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me llego en tiempo y forma, garza ahorita no eh tenido ningun problema con el equipo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente producción, solamente no traía mucha protección la caja. Pero llegó sin problema.
Ingresé chip Telcel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente teléfono. Vengo de un Galaxy S9 y sentí la diferencia. Gran batería, desempeño súper potente, gran cámara y muy buena pantalla."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Super buen producto. Funciona con att en México y va muy bien. La cámara no es de lo mejor pero es bastante decente y aceptable"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente telefono, la caja llego abierta pero creo que fue porque es de exportacion y la aduana lo ve."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Muy decepcionado, en una de las preguntas que le hacen al vendedor le preguntan si es dual sim y el dice que si. Yo necesitaba un equipo dual sim y me animé a comprarlo. Cuando llega, resulta que si tiene las dos entradas para colocar el sim, sin embargo solo es funcional una de ellas. Cuando me puse a investigar, resulta que en USA están prohibidos los equipos dual sim y por eso ningún equipo que venga de allá será dual sim. Necesito el teléfono para el trabajo y no tengo tiempo para regresarlo. Pero definitivamente no estoy feliz con el producto y me siento estafado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Un cellular completo siendo de gama media alta la verdad va más a alta que media. Las fotos son muy buenas y la batería me aguanta todo el dia."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Me gustó mucho el celular las fotos salen super bien, fue una gran compra, y me llegó súper rápido 😍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No tuve ningun inconveniente y llego 2 días antes de la fecha hasta Cancún ,todo excelente...llego sellado y completo...gracias"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente equipo, muy rápido y potente, tener 5G es un plus esperando que llegue pronto a México"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Buen teléfono en prestaciones y precio es de los mejores, la versión 5G es mejor que la que venden en México por su procesador snapdragon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","Excelente equipo, llegó más rápido de lo esperado, es la versión Snapdragon a un precio increíble, gracias Amazon USA"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","El producto llego en buen estado incluso dias antes de lo que me decia la app. Funciona bien lo recomiendo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 FE","No hacen factura tengo días solicitando la y no tengo respuesta

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I freaking LOVE my new Samsung Galaxy s21+!!! My s9 of 3 years was acting up on me so it was about time I upgraded. I heard that it only includes a recharge cable but not an adaptor, which was alright since I had to replace my own a week prior to me getting this. What I don't like (which is why I gave this phone a 4 star) is that Samsung pulled an Apple and also took out the audio output to plug in your headphones! So if you love listening to music like me, get a special type c audio adaptor for the s21 and s21+. Or if you don't mind that be sure to get wireless headphones or earbuds that support Bluetooth. Be sure to back up all your files to your Samsung account and Google accounts (like G-Photos) that way when you do the transfer (wireless or though cable connecting) you'll get everything downloaded on your phone. Reason I say this is because these newer phones don't come with a micro SD card slot anymore, Probably because of all the extra storage it already comes with. (mine is I think 182GB) All in all, I love my new phone and have no regrets!! 🥰"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the phone itself, there is pretty much no compalain.. except with the Finger Printer Reader. I have added a 360 cover but unable to detect finger print. Would hope Samsung to come with a more sensitive finger print sensor.

With Prime Deal, it's a great deal but not the best. I bough an S7 on Prime days 3 year ago and it was much much better deal. Would hope to see better Prime Day deal with Samsung phones in the future

With the shipping to Canada. It took a bit of time, would hope to see a quicker turnaround. Also, with my order, it was shipped the first time and somehow the courier returned it back to Amazon. I have to call and they have to process a ""return"" to trigger a re-send. It costs me another 3 or 5 days. Could have been smoother but overall it's ok. Also, the Import fee is resonable. It charged me around 15% but sent me back a refund after. Overall, the fee was around 11.5%, which is slightly cheaper than my provincial tax."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I came from the Samsung A70 (a $400 phone), and coming up to a flagship is a MASSIVE difference. I liked the camera on my old phone, it was fine, but on the s21+, it is phenomenal! Just the camera upgrade is great, but the 120 refresh rate is great too. I've heard YouTubers talk about the refresh rate pretty often, so I had high expectations for it. And I got to say, the experience is very real. After about a month of using this phone, I set my screen to 60hz, to see how long I could last with the old refresh rate. The difference was immodestly. In less than an hour, I had to switch back to 120hz. The Battery life on this phone is great too. I'm not a heavy user. Normally, I'm on youtube, texting friends, check emails, etc, and the battery is more than enough for it. I also use Google Maps a lot, and by the end of the day, I have about 30-50 percent battery left.

Overall, would definitely recommend this phone for anyone that is looking fro an upgrade"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I just got the phone, as of right now, it is great! Not exactly excited to have to buy adapters to make it connect to my car for the android auto but, in the grand scheme of things, it's really not a big problem."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's my first smart phone. I like it. I don't worship it and do NOT live my life by it. BUT, it is there when I need it. I love the color, performance and freedom. I like the larger screen size and amazing photo and video resolution. I could not bring myself to pay $400 more dollars for an Apple JUST for a storefront. Thanks Samsung!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I think Samsung outdid themselves, beautiful phone, got it one day early. the camera is great, the battery life is amazing, unless you are playing or some screen intensive task. The phone CLEARLY lives up to its hype and expectations, it truly goes above and beyond of what the S20+ was... I jumped from an S7 Edge to the S21+ and let me tell you, it was a huge jump, I can feel it with every swipe. I got a Spigen case armor so the phone is a little chunky now but I rather its like that than it breaks on the frs fall. The down sides of the phone: doesnt come with a charger, doesnt come with headphone jack or headphones, doesnt come with MicroSD card slot. All of those features I knew it didnt come with, its part of the market trend. I bought the original charger at samsung store, I do have Samsung galaxy buds so the headphones I dont mind, I DO miss the MicroSD card slot but I got the 128GB phone so I think it'll be fine..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Glitches with screen hardware. A few months ago went black out of the blue, finally came back after having a tech person check it out. Couldn't find any issues.... now the screen goes orange/green, was never dropped or in water... Will be buying a Google phone next, not trusting this 800.00 tool any longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Got this phone to replaced a 5 year old phone because AT&T is requiring all phone to have HD voice feature. Performance is great. I use this to play Genshin Impact at max performance setting, which is often used in reviews to gauge real-world performance, and it manages to maintain frame rate even after 30 mins without overheat like some other phones. The only complain i have is the under screen fingerprint reader is virtually useless after putting on a glass screen protector, even though the screen protector I put on claimed to be fingerprint reader friendly. There are other phones with newer fingerprint reader tech that can read through glass protector. But at least the face recognition is there for quick unlock."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is very good but can be much better
Procs:
Perfect screen
Very good camera photo/video
Highest performance
Design

Cons:
Absolutely backward charger max 25w, it is ridiculous. It is not a flagship smartphone. Any Chinese flagship has over 100w charger and can 10-100% for 20min.
Can`t find a dual sim/ esim support as described by Samsung. Looks like it will be added after updating to UI 4.0 and Android 12. Let`s see."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is a great phone if your into the Samsung ecosystem. I know this review seems to to be not picky but if I am paying $1000 for a phone it better be amazing. Sadly Samsung did not deliver for me. This phone will push you to use more Samsung products and apps. It got really frustrating for me because I was content to using googles ecosystem. Bixby is not that good and Google assistant is so much better. This phone also has a lot of features but it feels like with this phone is that they stuffed as many features they could without having a cohesive strategy on how they work together to improve the life of the user.

I will say this phone has amazing battery life and the screen movements are buttery smooth. It charges on wireless chargers fast and the screen is bright. However the skin of Android is not for me. I can see why people love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Just a bit disappointed that there was no adaptor, as some persons would not have switched phones for a while leaving them without the super fast adaptor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love this product! Saved my phone screen. Actually does what it's supposed to do (too rare these days). Easy to install after watching the brief video. I dropped phone several times over past 5 months since purchasing this. Had several cracks but when I removed the old screen protector it had multiple cracks in the protector but my phone was PERFECT! Unbelievable. They provide everything you need to do the install and you get 2 so have a replacement. Am buying again. Cannot review the face rec or finger print function as I don't use either. I have never had good luch with those functions even without a cover."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought at least 8 phones from Amazon without any problem . This time the Samsung S21 plus crashed after 4 months and restart many times a day but it self . Amazon can't do nothing for me . Now i should by a new one but no more phone from Amazon . I will buy it in samsung directly. I went to samsung likely i have one year of warranty. They fix the problem"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery life is excellent. I'm getting easily 2 days out of the battery. Great display. Photos are beautiful in daylight or night. My only gripe is I wish it was only 6"" long because any thing over that is tight in my pockets when sitting. Unfortunately the trend seems to be 6.25-6.5"" anymore."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The width is a little awkward with case even with large hands but not a deal breaker. I would buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The assurion protection plan is impossible. Don't spend the money just invest in a nice case instead.Not sure why Amazon partners with Assurion as they make the claims process impossible and have terrible customer service that hangs up on customers. See my review of that product for more information."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The sound feature drives me crazy! Why not keep the S8 plus feature. It was easier to adjust! I can hear my phone ringing even though I turned the phone volume down. Now if I'm in a meeting I have to go into the phone settings everytime to mute the phone for a customized time frame. That's too much...a person would prefer to just lower the volume from a touch of a button to silence it!Also, if I'm getting a call from an app I never see it appear on my screen if select notification. I see the message after. They really screwed up with the sound features on this phone.I must say camera is great! Scrolling is quick, but that's the only positive feedback I can give at this time. I wish my S8+ did not break!! This was supposed to be an upgrade. Not worth the money!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's a crying shame my carrier is forcing me to ""upgrade"". I'd keep my Mate 20, which at best is an okay phone, over this s21+ any day, but the carrier won't let it work on the network as of next year. Anyways, the good, I like the display alright... there must be something else, oh, I suppose battery life is decent. I guess it is smooth and fast out of the box, but aren't they all, flagships that is. Now for what I don't like. No headphone jack, and I knew it didn't have one, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Display aspect ratio, please quit making these phones look like a remote control. I couldn't reach the top on 5.5 in 16x9 screen, but I could reach both sides. Now I'm even farther away from the top of these sticks. All glass, hate it. Samsung bloat, not as bad as I remember, but still there. I thought the camera was supposed to be great, but I get way to many blurry photos. Fingerprint sensor is no where's near as good as any I've had on the back of a phone. Doesn't recognize it quite often. I'll miss not having an ir blaster, still used mine daily. I'll miss not having sd card slot. I'd love a removable battery, but I know I won't see on here. It's to bad, I'd love to see android phones from 5-8 years ago with modern specs any day over the current line up of iphones wanna be's. This is not an upgrade to me, it's settling for the least objectionable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great product, fingerprint reader much better, as advertised."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Overall, a good phone so far. Fingerprint takes a few tries. Battery charge could last longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Came with charging cord but not a charging block. Cord requires a different block that has a type c adapter insead of USB adapter. Now I have to buy a new block to be able to use my new cord. Also didn't come with headphones since they took away the headphone intup adapter and bow have to use headphone with the type c charging cord end. Other than that I love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","They make it so easy to switch to a new phone and keep all your information, photos and contacts. Loaded with features and runs flawlessly. Great battery life and an incredible camera. I scored top brownie points with this gift to the wife she loves it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone has an incredible display and very solid battery life. The camera on this thing is INSANE. I showed several people some videos I took and they swore it looked 8k (may have been shot in 8k, but the S21+ screen is only 1080p).The 120hz refresh rate screen creates a silky smooth and snappy experience, especially when scrolling. With this phone, I was able to take advantage of all of androids customization with the software without experiencing any lag.Highly recommend this over the regular S21 if larger display and battery life are key aspects for you."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Long battery life, great screen, good speed.Finger print doesn't like me...but I have several 'seasons ' on me, and it may be operator error!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Me gusta recomendar las cosas que funcione porque de esa manera se ayuda a las personas con mi experiencia recomendada 100%"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Functions great some quirks I didn't expect. Battery life not as long as I thought and it sometimes had to be restarted in rural areas as it loses track of signal. But it's better than smoke signals and walkie talkies. Great video and camera features."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Se congela la pantalla"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Beautiful display, very good photos. So far good cellular service. But the fingerprint reader is the worst. ""Upgraded"" from my S9 Who's fingerprint reader worked instantly. To this, that takes forever to learn my fingerprint. And then not be able to read it after it says it's got it. And locks me out, and makes me use my pin."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It was advertised as Special Features as having expandable memory….but I have not found any expandable memory ….. misleading"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good if you're looking for a phone that can do a little bit of everything for you such as high quality pictures, excellent performance and even great audio quality (loudness is okay, nothing crazy), there are a lot of better options out there, however depending on the price and how much you like or trust Samsung devices this one will be a perfect fit (I've been using Samsung Products for quite some time and the only one to let me down was a Galaxy Note 3 after dropping 1 time). Definitely feels like a high quality product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My wife got this phone for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It was easy to set up, and my wife says it is very fast. She is very happy with it, and I'm happy she loved her Christmas gift!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great battery, there are times I can go two days without needing to charge. It was easy to set up, took the phone to T-Mobile and the process was done in 15 minutes. The performance is amazing, apps never crash and everything loads really fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really love this smartphone. At first I couldn't transfer my contacts to car so the car never showed who was calling, and couldn't dial by name, then the Android 11 update hit a couple of weeks ago and all is well now. Perfect phone, no complaints, works wonders."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Recell was great. Phone arrived and look brand new. Work flawlessly. Very happy with the condition of the phone. Bought it for my wife and she thought it was too big so returned it. Return was easy and seller was very helpful. Would order a refurbished phone from them again in a heart beat."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I rated the fingerprint and facial recognition medium as I don't use either. But the phone is great. I was replacing a GS10 I thought I lost with GS21+ 5G and then I found the GS10. But after trying out the GS21+ 5G, as I had read, the graphics will dazzle you. They did, graphics are amazing! I was disappointed the 3.5 mm head phone jack was gone and I didn't know no external SD Card support. But 256GB internal storage should be more than enough, since most photos and stuff are in the Cloud. Great phone, love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have had this phone for almost 2 months and it has been working fine until a couple of days ago. I was sleeping and when I wake up and try to unlock the phone, I found that it doesn't turn on the screen (phone was on, and I can unlock it with the finger but the screen remainedblack). Looking on Google (S21 black screen of dead) I found this is quite common issue with the S21 phones, on my case I was lucky enough that after some hours it start working again, nevertheless now I'm worried this could happen again.For a phone this price, this kind of issues should be unacceptable. I have been a Samsung user for years but after this experience I thinking that my next phone will be from another brand"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Tengo unos 2 meses de uso y que belleza de móvil, antes de comprarlo tenía pensado comprar un iPhone 12 pro, pero el iPhone por sus características y precio era muy caro, sin embargo cuando compré el s21 plus estaba a 799, un mejor precio a comparación"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good phone. Camera is terrific!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The S9+ was a great phone. Unfortunately the speaker that you listen to while holding the phone to your ear was failing. The S21+ might have a faster processor, a better screen, maybe even longer battery life but the lack of the notification LED sucks! You don't know how much you relied on this feature until it is gone. The fact that it would stay on until the notification was acknowledged is a much needed feature. If there is a way of doing this with the S21 line I haven't found it. I'm not the person that carries their phone with them all the time. I really miss the ability to see if there is a message or a email without interacting with the phone. It might be sitting on a table or in the charger and just looking at it from across the room or whatever and seeing a blinking light that notifies a message or email is so much better than having to pick it up to determine if there is anything waiting. A decision made by Samsung based on higher profits to the detriment of the devices functionality and the used satisfaction I am sure."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Compré S21+. El negro de 256gb y el plateado de 128gb. Ambos funcionan excelente. Me cambié de Huawei P20 pro, y se nota bastante la diferencia de la velocidad.La cámara esta perfecta y la batería dura bastante. El precio al momento de la compra fue de $799 cada uno. Honestamente vale la pena la inversión. Y viene desbloqueado. Funciona en Panamá perfecto.Si tienes un celular viejo de más de 3 o 4 años, vas a notar la diferencia en la velocidad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like the phone, very nice style and the face recognition is awesome. The fingerprint reader is in front screen so make sure your screen protector is compatible with fingerprint reader.I don't like it because it has not headphone connector, and it has not notifications light indicator or charging light indicator."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Upgraded from the s8 so there is a noticeable change. As in battery life, I'm able to use it up to 5 or 6 hours just on youtube alone, less for gaming obviously. Also, if you are looking for tempered glass protector with the fingerprint reading actually working, I recommend using ""unique"" tempered glass screen protector. Overall, it's a nice phone that feels luxurious and performs smoothly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is very good. Do not like the fact that three weeks after receiving, the price dropped $200. Tempted to return and reorder. Amazon should make a price adjustment for these situations. For the telephone's performance, would give 5 stars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Best most amazing phone ever. Cost a lot but WELL WORTH the money. BUY IT. You won't be disappointed!!! I'm still finding the incredible things it will do every day!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is an awesome phone!!! I got the 256GB version for $799 it's a very good deal that was new delivered unlocked over knight and it has a lot less useless pre installed app's that are installed from your cell provider. Consumer Cellular is the way to go for the cheapest and best service available! I got the Otterbox Defender case for it and I'm well pleased with the whole thing! Update: now it's $1049 thank you Amazon for this great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is packed with lots of features and 5G capability. We are getting 100+ Mbps on T-mobile 5G network. The battery life is better than expected. It lasted almost 2 days with normal daily use (web browsing, little gaming, etc.). Wireless charging is definitely a big plus and is very easy to use. It's a great replacement for our outed Android phone. Amazon's promotion and payment plan also made the phone really affordable."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Well this is my first flagship phone and it hasn't let me down at all, the fingerprint sensor does struggle with alot of cases and screen protectors but everything else has been absolutely fantastic! The camera qualities fantastic in everything except snapchat unfortunately. I use it for alot of games and other hardware intensive apps and it's gotten abit warm but aside from that it's handled everything great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've only had the phone for a few weeks but so far I am most impressed. The daily battery life is outstanding. Calls are clear and crisp. Display is outstanding."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like my Samsung 21+ phone. It has fingerprint reader & facial reader. I would recommend this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I purchased a galaxy s20 plus for me and a galaxy s21 plus for my wife. They are both good phones, but the auto focusing is a nightmare. I use some apps and scan products, but sometimes I try to scan more than 10 times, and it doesn't focus to the barcode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Por el precio es mejor comprar el s21 normal ya que no hay mucha diferencia más que el tamaño de la pantalla"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The biggest failure on this phone is clearly the fingerprint reader. With or without a screen protector about half the time it will give a error saying that the finger must cover the entire sensor or to press harder despite having a full size thumb covering it. The facial recognition is a little bit better but still has a high failure rate of recognition. The battery life is decent enough, processing speed and storage are satisfactory so no real complaints there. But my several year old Huawei phone is definitely better at both fingerprint and facial recognition. Very disappointing product from Samsung for this at this price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it, still learning all the ways to use it, the SG21+5G. NONE of the cases or protective front covers fit. I asked for S21+ & didn't know there would be such a size difference between the S21 & the S21+ when I was shopping. I know, ignorance, not tech savvy, my bad. I didn't return items because I opened each hoping at least 1 would fit."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was at first skeptical about purchasing an unlocked phone because I have never done this before, always went directly to a cell carrier. But with the outrageous prices they charge for a new phone plus all the extra stuff they get you on, I said why not.So far so good....battery life is great, best value for your money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I really like this phone the color and the size is great I thought it was going to be to big but it's perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So far, I love this phone, I am getting my emails faster on the phone than on my computer. It is still only been a few days so there is still so much to learn.I have now had this phone for quite some time and I am very halt with it. The battery last at least 24 hours, I have never had it run out in me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Estaba dudosa en comprar el equipo por el tema de la aduana, pero debo decir que lo recibí sin problemas y me funcionó con la red de México en mi caso Movistar, la vdd fue un cambio drástico de tener un galaxy s9 a este nuevo, lo que más me gustó la duración de la batería, muy feliz y me salio mucho más barato que comprarlo directo las samsung store"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","No charger and you need to buy a type c to usb A adapter !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone has not impressed me one bit. I ""upgraded"" from a Galaxy S9+ to this Galaxy S21+. So far, every aspect of the S9+ has been better. I cannot tell any improvement, but the ergonomics have definitely gotten worse.The fingerprint scanner essentially does not work. And that's if you can find it. The scanner is in a random spot in the screen. Once you actually find it, it just says ""press harder"" or ""cover the whole sensor"" no matter how much pressure or coverage I use.And moving the buttons all to the same side makes using them much more difficult. Everything is now operated by one finger rather than being able to make use of your index finger (this also makes screenshots more difficult).I would not recommend this phone as an upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Todo en orden. No trae cargador solo el cable del resto bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I went to multiple carriers AT&T ,Verizon ,metro ,And t-mobile was only 1 it was able to operate with because it was carrier locked"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything is working as it should, Love the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought this phone as an upgrade from a Pixel 2XL. Wow is it smokin fast!!! A highly graphics intensive game I play (Eve Echoes) is really really fast. Faster than my Galaxy Tab S6. The only negative is the battery is advertised as 4800 mah but I actually got 4300 mah per Accubattery so I'm really not happy about that part."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Funciona sin problemas en Venezuela"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","a well balanced phone and has great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This product is not for me, was for somebody else. But till now there is now complain about it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great features and functionalities. I love the battery life ability."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am not very happy with my S21+. The most significant loss was the camera quality. The S21+ camera is not that sharp and colors are not that bright as in S9+. The S21+ software cannot focus correctly at closer distances and white balance looks a little bit shifted. Another problem of S21+ is the fingerprint reader that would not work with screen protector. The one more bad thing is that there is no SD card anymore. I see only three positive things in S21+ comparing with S9+. There are: 5G cellular, Wifi6, and a flatter screen. If I knew all the negative things about S21+, I would never switch from S9+ to S21+."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","In case you weren't aware, this phone has got a flat screen. A FLAT SCREEN. That's right! A flat screen on a Samsung flagship. No more super dumb curved screens. Just terrific. Brilliant even. Other than that it's a nice phone that does normal phone things. Battery is great! FLAT SCREEN"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Hola era un regalo , cuando me llego lo envolvi y no me llego el cargador del telefono."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought for my daughter to replace her s8+.It was easy to set up, and is more than adequate for her needs.It is quick, responsive, nice camera, and allows her to do her Instagram cosplay, art, and photo editing very well.Plays her favorite mobile games flawlessly.Overall great upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Amazing so far. I come off having Hwaei M9 for the last 4 years and this is truly awesome to use. First time also with a flagship phone. Any way I'll be updating the further I use the phone. This is purely an adrenaline indused review.Great product Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love everything about this phone, I upgraded from an s8+. No complaints yet, came brand new in box unopened. If you're looking for a great phone to use that feels nice, has a long-lasting battery, charges super fast, big screen, and awesome camera, choose this one!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Definitely a good upgrade if your looking to buy a new phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I dont used the face recognition. I use finger print."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am a long time Android user and a Samsung fan. This phone changed all of it!Fingerprint reader is the worst! They tried to solve a problem that does not exist. On screen fingerprint reader is pointless, utterly useless, and does not work! More so with screen protector. I setup multiple times, and keep getting worse!Edit: just noticed this bixby joke cannot be disabled anymore(you could disable in earlier generations). It has access to EVERYTHING sitting in backseat all the time. Obviously it is not equivalent to siri, its just another door for Samsung to collect tha data. Samsung i am soo done with you!!Battery is great but you pay the price by weight, my fingers getting numb trying to hold this brick.Gorilla fingers guaranteed after using is couple more months."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Es lindo, pero la carga es mala y aparte se calienta mucho"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is absolutely amazing, now I go thru a lot of highend phones, the camera..the screen.. the battery.. the feel.. the speakers and the performance is on another level than anything else on the market, the new iPhones can't compete with this phone. This is a Triple GO!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Todo perfecto, todo funciono muy bien lo compré desbloqueado para usarlo en Ecuador y todo va perfecto hasta ahora."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love my Samsung 21plus. I didn't realize how slow my previous phone was until I purchased this phone. Wow what a change.Transferring data from old phone to my new phone was a breeze. Thank you samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So far, so good. Love the phone and it is very responsive to touch and very fast compared to my old S8. No complaints and glad I got it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is absolute garbage. My phone, since day one, gets extremely hot to the touch. The battery charge does not last, even when no apps are running in the background. I can spend an hour on the phone browsing the web and lose 20-25% of the charge. I have wired and wireless charging issues, even with new Samsung-branded accessories. My old phone gets a better signal from my carrier's towers (for voice AND data) compared to this ""upgrade"". Also, for an unlocked phone, the amount of apps they pre-load on the phone that you cannot delete is beyond belief. Gone are the days of buying an unlocked phone and getting a pristine install with minimal bloat. Samsung has turned into a disappointment. Do not buy this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Hasta el momento todo bien es snapdragon y anda muy bien en consumos de batería"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Cost $1059 & screen went black while using & was almost fully charged just 6 months after purchase! Customer service no help other than advise to take to a local service/repair store. Ridiculous!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I had 17% upon receiving so I did Not get very far with NO way to charge Device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I live in a complete dead zone, so I need calling over wifi and texting over wifi to function (especially when the device theoretically supports it.)My S9+ works great with Wifi calling on Republic Wireless, and Ting.This S21+ with the *same sim cards*? It doesn't even have the option for wifi calling on Ting or the Mint trial I tossed in to see. Not in Phone settings, not in connection info. Wifi calling showed up on the Republic Card, seemed to work, but then my number transferred to Ting so I can't test further. But so far, one out of three carriers? Oof.And Mint can't even get Data *and* calling working at the same time while on cellular, it either gets LTE/5G with a circle and slash for bars, or when you make a call it forces itself down to 2/3G but gets no data. Yeah, I tried all the APNs I could find, Samsung is just incapable of releasing software that works, and I'm not quite willing to drop ~$1,300 after tax on a phone that doesn't do what it's advertised to.Pictures are nice though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So much faster than S7 it replaced. Glass is fingerprint resistant. Face recognition does not work with masks. I don't use a screen protector, so fingerprint sensor works wonderfully. 5G is better than gym's wifi. Happy camper."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is soo good and exactly what I need in a phone, I highly recommend to anyone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My s21 has been working well so far, no problems, good quality! Face recognition can be a bit slow at times but smooth performance and good camera quality. A quality smartphone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","There wasn't a charging box included."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is decent overall, it's a beautiful device. However after using Pixel for 3 years I am clear that the Samsung UI is of no good. They try to make it funky with too many options they you won't ever need, but the simplicity and intuitiveness of the Pixel is insanely amazing.Also, I HATE the fingerprint sensor on this stupid thing. It does not work 75% of the time. You have to find the right spot on the screen, press hard enough and 9 pit of 10 times I have to try multiple times in the hope that one time it will recognize me. This makes day or o day usage irritating, despite good battery life and a decent-ish camera.Not a bad device, but go for the Pixel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Can't complain awesome battery life and performance is top notch"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","a great upgrade from her previous phonegood battery life and camera is very clear and photos look great.bought it just in time for our daughters 2nd birthday."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought my device used, the listing said used- good condition, was expecting minor scuffs but the phone came out practically new, the phone works great have some great pictures and awesome display."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it better than any other phone I have ever had work with metro by t mobile 5g super charging best and also the ai learns my wake up and sleep schedules really great highly recommend."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","As advertised its a brand new phone, all it had was a scratch on the box. Super fast shipping, best price I saw out there. thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excellent phone, large 256 GB, very nice camera and perfect size overall."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is a huge upgrade from my pixel2"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Slick phone--Very fast, great screen. Very happy with it. I upgraded from an earlier Samsung--only wished it could transfer all the notification noise settings for texts, applications would have been transferred. Would definitely buy again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I thought I was getting a new phone. I specifically looked for a listing that didn't say renewed. The description didn't say anything about a renewed or refurbished phone. The box is in terrible shape so who knows what the phone will be like. Paid way too much for a used phone. Definitely returning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The S21 is a downgrade from last years S20 than an upgrade. Also, Samsung decided to be greedy like Apple and decided to stop including the headset, charger, and no sd slot. It also gets very hot, and more expensive to the point where it's not worth it. I use to use Apple products but stopped because of those very same issues, now Samsung is just as selfish and greedy as Apple, except Apple are actually better products as far as reliability and performance. For the same price, the Iphone is actually a better product, but I don't like Apple so I would get a different manufacture, such as the new Sony Xperia 1 iii cellphone. Hopefully the others don't follow Apple/Samsung greediness..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love Samsung phones and I've gotten them through Amazon on prime days twice now. It's the best phone. Cameras are always great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is amazing. Fast, clean, and works really well. It is also great 4G and wifi connections."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It was a very good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone has been great. Had local Verizon store help set it up and has been great so far. Fingerprint reader doesn't work well with screen protector though."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great camera, battery and screen. Sorry I waited so long. Keep your old phone for tv, remote control and camera. Long wait but great price on excellent phone. Highly recommended."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it love it love it. Battery life is great, very valuable for the price. Quick delivery and exact product expecting!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Never expected Samsung's flagship Galaxy S line would be this mediocre... Battery get's through the day with a big power saving from my end or 10-20 min on super fast charge. I expected one sim slot, but did not expect it to be even without e-sim option. Camera must be from 2018. Fingerprint reader is quite demanding.Coming from Huawei P30 Pro, I expected 2 years worth of advancement, but alas it does feel like downgrade in every aspect. Wish Huawei still had the google play, Samsung would be hanging for dear life in this market. I think with biggest competitor removed Samsung dropped their game."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have already tried to have this phone repaired by the local authorized Samsung technician to no avail and mailed it in to their Texas technicians because apps constantly crashing and phone randomly reboots. After getting it back the second time the phone crashed before it even got to the connect to WiFi screen of the new setup and it crashed twice in the 15 minutes following that.Samsung would not replace or refund and only offered the option to mail it in AGAIN for a third attempt to repair it.Regret purchasing this phone. I have had issues with other Samsung products and will not purchase another one again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Useless fingerprint reader.No way to adjust the resolution on the camera, wastes lots of space for unimportant photos.Backwards control buttons, moved to the right side.Deleted all sensors available on earlier models of Galaxy.Bigger screen with worse resolution than on Galaxy S9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Got this phone on prime day. It has been a very good phone. Had not had any problems yet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Upgraded from S8 to S21+. It's a terrific phone, albeit a bit heavier than I would like. Battery, screen quality, camera all significant upgrade from S8."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Nice"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone stopped working (stopped reading sim card after 10 months). The Samsung webpage is dysfunctional, with it impossible to initiate the phone warranty process (tried multiple different browsers, it just sticks you in a loop that looks to me to be intentional, I'll have to find the time to wait hours on the phone some time to start the warranty process).Additionally, coming from pixel phone, I found Samsung software to be inferior to that of the pixel in nearly every case. Phone is listed as Esim capable, but is not in US. Samsung Visual voicemail is a joke , the message app is horrible. There is absolutely nothing about this phone that gave me a better experience than my much cheaper pixel phone.Between this and my Samsung TV which is shoving ads down my face, my Samsung refrigerator whose icemaker freezes over every week, and this completely disappointment of a phone, if I never own another Samsung product again, it will be too soon."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My girlfriend love it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Other than not coming with a charger it was a smart choice. I like it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","la bateria le dura todo el día, la camara buenisima, deberia esspecificar que este modelo no trae doble sim"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","pluses large 4k screen nice fast 5g reception great cameraminuses no micro sd slot"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Pixel quality has really gone downhill so I came back to Samsung. So far very happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is absolutely amazing for all the cool things you can do with it. The camera is incredible!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is amazing was like new I didn't see anything wrong at all all packed right and shipping was fast I give it 100%"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Upgrade from the one plus 6T, definitely met my expectations. Best quality and value for money. I would recommend to get one."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love the battery life. No idea why I need this phone, but it was a nice upgrade from an s8."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like the size of the screen, the face recognition works very well and the fingerprint reader. No good with the screen protector"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Strongly resent Samsung's decision removing the micro-sd card from s21+! I mistakenly assumed s21 has micro-sd just like my s10+. Would say bye-bye to galaxy phones if micro-sd is not returned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Fastest Smartphone I've ever Had"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Overall I loved the phone. Fingerprint sensor was very touchy though. The only problem I have is that after a year and a half the screen just stopped working. You could tell it was working and it would still ring, but nothing would light up. Restarting the phone didn't help. Also, no the phone was not dropped and it was in a protective case."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Este telefono es muy completo exelente"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Went from a 7 edge to an S21 plus 5G"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I loved it at first. It worked great, then one day I kept getting messages, but could not see them. The screen is completely black. Cannot do anything with it. I even watched YouTube videos for suggestions on how to reboot it and clear, as they called it (the black screen of death). Nothing worked. I had to buy another phone. This time I went directly to Verizon. At least it is covered that way."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Nice large display,love all the features"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Fast, looks great, camera takes amazing pictures"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Takes super pics. Good size to hold. Crisp screen"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sick phone. Wish there was a 256 gb version."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Best phone I've bought in years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","What a joke! I am visually impaired and hoped the phone would have more features to help me use it efficiently. As soon as you turn the power on you have to agree to let Google, Samsung and who know who else, track and record everything you do. I can't even use the voice to text feature without allowing Samsung to record my message!? I rely on this feature and Samsung is taking advantage of my disability. Then Google starts streaming unwanted and unsolicited ads that totally interrupt and confuse me as I don't realize I'm reading and ad. If I spend $1000 for a phone I do not expect to lose all of my privacy rights. I'll stick with my old phone."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love the phone works great no problems."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sadly I had to return the phone. After doing a soft reset (vol down and power at same time), the phone would not get past the Samsung and Galaxy logo on the boot back up. It is called a boot loop and happens on a very small percentage of phones. I took it to the tech guys at T-Mobile and uBreakiFix and they tried a factory reset but it would not download the O/S. I only had the phone for about two weeks before this started happening My previous phone was an Apple Iphone 6 Plus. Compared to that phone, the Galaxy S21+ was unbelievably fast."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Killer photosAll day battery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really a great phone !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Muy bueno"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone was listed as new so I paid new phone price and received a used/refurb with PICTURES FROM PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP!I like the phone but am very disappointed in paying new retail price for a used phone.The phone's gallery has a neat function and will ask to auto edit pictures which are blurred, correct bad lighting, delete old documents etc. After three days of setting the phone up, dealing with idiosyncrasies and updates, a notification suggested I check out some pictures to edit. They were pictures from June 2021 yet I purchased this phone in December 2021."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelent product!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The youtube apps is not working."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Stop working after 1.5 year. Matherboard crashes. No repair or warranty. DO NOT BUY IT!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","One of the best phones I have ever had."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good value"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Like the phone. Disliked nothing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Me encanta,lo mejor es samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Didn’t receive a charger with my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Hermoso"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love the phone. Works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought a [factory unlocked us version] s22 plus the 256gb. I intended to use this on visible as visible lists this model as compatible.Unfortunately when I entered the imei number on visible web site it said it is not compatible.Ugh.Trying to decide if I should just return it. Unfortunately the price has went up.Ugh"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","What a huge disappointment. After exhaustive research, and saving up to get a what I was convinced, was a quality phone, I quickly realized it was a dud. I tried customer support, and had to reset everything, and start from scratch, which helped, but not for long. I honestly cannot give any feature of this frustrating thing, a cursery positive mention. Call quality, signal, volume, etc etc etc. Quite poor to say the least. It's so buggy, it's difficult to even perform basic tasks without swearing at it. Save yourself a headache, and pass on this one"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone itself appeared to be in good order. No scratches or visible damage. I was on a phone call, using the speaker, and the screen just went blank. I was not able to do anything with the phone, not even shut it off. I took it to my local Verizon store to see if they could get it to work and they could not. You're always taking a chance with a refurbished phone. The 1 month warranty should have been a clue there would be an issue. I recommend purchasing a new phone from a local vendor."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone is nice. As I'd hoped. Looks and feels brand new. The fingerprint sensor takes 3-4 presses to work. Not sure if it's me or the sensor...Regardless, it's better than my old A21. Think I'll buy a refurbished tablet next."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone black screens and usually you can force reset it, but this time (11 month old phone) it went black and nothing is working. Trash like this shouldn't cost anywhere close to this much."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was looking forward to switching back to Samsung after the one Google phone I had. This has been nothing but problems. Samsung had me take the phone in multiple times because the camera would not work and that still is not fixed. Now the charging port is not working correctly and the phone is not even a year old. These phones are to expensive to have to deal with all this hassle. I'm so disappointed"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Charger did not come with an adapterNot sure if this phone is actually s21 ""plus"" the options/ features are not the same in videos"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded.
 From the day I bought it the phone isn't working properly. Now it froze and I don't know what to do with it.as you can see from the video I posted. I would appreciate if you help me to return it and get my money back."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't buy S21's. Any model
High failure rate per cell phone seller's
Factory launch was too soon before adequate field testing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Compre la versión Americana de 256 GB, y lo traje a mi país, Ecuador, el teléfono a los 8 días de uso, se reinicio automáticamente y a lo que se encendió se quedo congelo la pantalla (se quedo encendida) y se puso caliente y no lo podía apagar o manipular, cuando pude reiniciar el teléfono no se volvió a encender, decepción total con el equipo, tenia muchas expectativas.
El teléfono nunca se cayo o mojo."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Do not get this phone. From day one, apps that worked fine on my S9, crash constantly. The phone also locks up randomly and I have to do a soft reset. When it does lock up, I will not receive phone calls or text messages. Contacted Samsung and the only option I have is to mail it in to them and be without a phone for 30 days or more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","If the finger print reader is important to you then do not buy this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","HORRIBLE PRODUCT.. the speaker stopped working after barely one month of use! This must’ve been a refurbished device that was fraudulently listed as new."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the illusion of buying this products they also sell you the need for a case, protectors and extras. Super annoying, my phone lasted a month."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I dislike this phone because it has shut off and restarted since i bought it. Dont buy"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","not worth 1000. Why did the price raise up from 799 to 999 in a few days?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Crap, I so hate I missed the return window, my last phone a $250.00 Motorola G7 power, 100% better then this phone, I feel robbed, I really wish I would've bought something else or thought to return this in time, the battery life is trash, charging time is trash, pictures are nice, speaker phone is trash, Spend your money on something else."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Already returned! I am very worried it might explode. Charge speed is super slow. Only worth $400. Don't buy!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The product is an eight hundred dollar phone. The item was received without a charging device? Really, I have one charging device in my household. I purchased a new device expecting to be able to use the device out of the box. All bets are off. I received a defective device. (I cannot determine whether its operating correctly)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good luck getting wifi to work for more than 20 minutes at reasonable speeds.

My home network is 1000Mbs and it only connects at 7Mbs. All other devices at the house, Samsung included, work perfectly except this phone.

And no, it's not a router issue. It's a phone issue"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't buy this crap, it has too many issues and Samsung is NOT able to resolve it. Echo's like you are talking to someone in the MARS. Missed calls, nothing is good on this new device i can mention."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery won't last the whole day, battery only last about 6 hours. And the finger print is not that great either."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Terrible purchase."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Complete scam! Even the box was fake!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","too hot
while playing games with this phone, the phone becomes too hot, since the phone is too hot the screen stops responding, your game is lost!!!!!!!!! Tranks Samsung! made me lost my game and waste my time!!!!!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was informed it would be a unlocked phone and upon me taking it to the store. They inform me there's nothing they can do because I was sent a locked phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Do not buy from this seller. Quality of the phone is very poor. Comparing the packaging to Verizon box, it seemed too sketchy and wouldn’t even let us set up the phone properly"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is supposed to have the best camera out there, but the quality is just pitiful. Even worse, if I try to send pictures to my computer for editing, they become even more pixilated/grainy. I'm thinking I'm gonna return this one..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Caja abierta
Y dice que no está abierto"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very disappointed, the phone heats up so quickly, just 5 minutes after using it.
My previous phone that I got from Verizon did not!

I would not buy a phone from Amazon ever again!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","not unlocked"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Returned this item. Does NOT work with Sprint/T-Mobile, different antenna, seller did not clarify. Still waiting for a 1700 dollar credit on Amazon card. Be careful when buying phones online!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Loved my phone, the battery life, the speed. Up until it shattered for no particular reason front and back. Had a full case on it the whole time. Very disappointed!!!!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I want the extra protection plan for my phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","With the in-screen ultrasound fingerprint sensor, you have to choose between a screen protector or being able to use fingerprint. By VERY far, the worst fingerprint sensor I came across"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery dies after like 4 hours of use. Phone repeatedly freezes and shuts down and very slow to load even with full signal."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This item is not intentionally unlocked. It is not dual sim compatible. The hardware was nice, but it did not meet my needs"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Highly disappointed with Samsung I purchased a brand new unlocked phone that wouldn't even turn on after taking it out the box SMH"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Realmente me costo que me cojiera mi huella estoy arrepentido de este teléfono no coherente y la señal super mala"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Phone constantly drops calls and then reboots. Poor quality product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Battery terrible, no way near the money,"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't work, battery fried in it after 2 months"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Aside from the aforementioned, be forewarned; if you're going to use the phone's mobile hotspot, be ready for the dreaded ""Connected without Internet""."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Pretty much crap phone randomly restarts typical junk, just buy a iPhone instead and save yourself the hassle"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I got a second-hand phone, no doubt."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is not coming on!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Not compatible with TMobile 5G"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","So I got the S21+ 256GB for $799. When I was gonna buy it I could pick between 128GB vs 256GB for storage, but the price was the exact same for either. Also when I look now it is up to $1000 for both models.
I don't understand the pricing structure here.
1080p screen is fine, I have to get within 3 inches to see pixels and even that is difficult. You won't notice the screen unless you do phone virtual reality, and I don't know who even cares about that now.
For all other comparisons just look up videos on YouTube they are all pretty accurate.

BUY S21 IF:
-If you don't want to spend over $1000 for a phone
-Want a smaller-ish phone
-Want the best specs and camera

BUY S21+ IF:
-If you don't want to spend over $1000 for a phone
-Like big phones
-Want the best specs and camera

BUY S21 ULTRA IF:
-you don't care about money
-Like big phones
-Want the best specs and camera

DONT BUY THESE PHONES IF:
-Can you wait until September 2021 when new phones come out?
-You do competitive gaming on your phone
-Dont want to spend $700+ on a phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have had an iPhone for over ten years. I upgraded from the 4 to the 8. The only reason I was getting a new phone is because mine fell in the toilet. Rice trick didn’t work. After reading the “new” iPhone reviews, I decided to read the Galaxy reviews and was impressed. Thankfully, I received my Galaxy s21 5G 2 days earlier than expected. Honestly, I love this phone!! It’s so user friendly, and I’m finding new features almost everyday. I don’t see me ever going back to iPhone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have low call volume issue and found out that if i hold my ear not to center like usually, but in the middle of center and left edge - then the call volume is ok.
This is a very annoying issue and requires holding the phone in a clumsy fashion."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've had the phone about a month and I am happy with it. I used to have a Note 4 so the S21+ is a lot faster. I don't spend much time gaming and watching videos on my phone so I'm not a screen expert but to me it is really nice. The physical size/weight of the phone is about the same as the old Note 4 but without the bezels the screen is much bigger (which is great for aging eyes). Again I am not a heavy duty user so the battery lasts 2-3 days and when I do need a charge the quick charging is a plus. So far I am very pleased with the phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Sorry that it does not have a microphone jack"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is a nice phone:
* Fast
* Smooth (scrolling is responsive)
* Small (not Ultra version)
* Camera (takes good photos)
* Price (reasonable)

But:
* Not the same build quality as the older phones
* Screen Mirroring is Broken (cannot override DEX desktop interface)
* Slow/Unreliable Face ID (sometimes even refuses to try)
* Flaky fingerprint sensor
* Funky button layout (reversed)

(a) cannot take selfie right-handed using Volume button as shutter, because the power button is on the bottom near right index finger, and volumes buttons are out of reach at the top!

(b) software buttons are reverse order of a Pixel layout (which in subsequent versions, removed all, but one)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","beautiful phone. people complain about the material make up in comparison to the S20. I actually prefer this over the S20. The camera on S21 is more clear, sharp, and natural in colors compared to the S20 photo quality is more saturated. It's all to your preference. I also like the design. Not too crazy about the back being plastic compared to S20 glass back - in the end I just use phone cases anyways.

Only thing I dislike a little is the battery life. Though it takes a few days to optimize, it is lacking. I enable 120hz display which does drain the battery, however, compared to my 2017 Razer phone which also is 120hz - the battery life on Razer performed far better than S21. There is an option to switch to 60hz display which optimizes long life for battery. This is all based on your preference. I choose to have a 120hz display so I expect the battery to drain a little.

Bottom line - I would recommend to ignore reviews who complain about battery life, material, etc but do not provide substantial reasoning."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","We really like these new phones, my wife and I both purchase the Samsung Galaxy s21 & the plus thru T-Mobile."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great screen and very good camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Don't believe all the reviews that say this phone is bad, not worth the money, or a downgrade. The S21+ is a powerful, flagship device. Superfast, no lag, beautiful display, powerful camera. The face recognition is superfast. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the fingerprint reader. It is rather slow and not always accurate. Certainly not a deal breaker. I got phone at a great price after trade-in at AT&T. Love this phone. Best phone I have ever owned."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Only worth if you are getting it free as a trade in. Missing items or features: charger, SD card slot, headphone jack, lower resolution, plastic back even tho s+ is listed as glass, non replaceable battery. Samsung is chasing Apple when most Android users avoid Apple for a reason. Two stars are for the 5g and removing Bixby button."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente producto, sin embargo como todo, tiene su pro y contra.
Muy buen audio, pantalla aceptable aunque bajarla a Full HD si es algo absurdo, rapidez perfecta, como era de esperarse de un celular Samsung, un celular genial y más si vale 800usd (como lo compre)
No incluir cargador ni audífonos si es algo que afecta, aunque ya tengas uno y la cámara, siento que pudo haber mejorado un poco más."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone was working great until 7 months later, the top speaker started crackling...I looked online and its a common issue for all samsung phones! This will be my last samsung phone I'll ever buy and will never buy a samsung again. Garbage pile of junk!! I'm buying an apple iPhone to replace this junk."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I'm not sure if I just got a faulty device, but my phone shut off after 3 months and unable to turn back on no matter what I, and the tech support, tried. My provider ended up exchanging it for a new device (same model) and said that it is a known issue, though rare. Outside of that, the phone worked well and the camera was great!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","About time samsung fingerprint face recognition battery life all to great Upgraded from the s10 this is definitely a phone that's worth heads up it run fhd ➕ plus no micro SD card so be prepared to backup and transfer using smart switch"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone itself is great! I love it. The problem is it only comes with a charging cord not a brick . So I had to buy the charger separate. It also doesn't have a headphone jack. I paid 1000$ through my carrier so you are getting a really getting a good price.

The fingerprint reader is inconsistent and for me doesn't work that often. The face recognition is decent it not great.

The phone is very fast. I love the fact that I can play real xbox games through their cloud gaming service on my phone that I am really enjoying.

All in all I love samsung phones my galaxy s7 edge lasted me over 5 years that is why I went with another galaxy s phone because I know I will last long."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Doesn't have a plug for head phones. I don't like too use my air pods outside of my house so when I got this phone I was disappointed. Graphics are good though. Camera shots are amazing. Apple is a bit better."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Lo puedo activar en México"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","UPDATE!!! 03/15/2121 I got an email from Samsung saying that my trade in phone was not what they were expecting. I even called Samsung to verify that my phone was the 5G because I wasn't sure. They told me it was and that I was good to go. Now I'm Being told that it is not, and that I'm going to be charged $550. WTF is with this company. People need to stop buying Samsung products because of the issues they're having and Samsung throwing us to the curb!!!! Do not buy the Galaxy S21!!! I got the phone on Tuesday and found out today that the Bluetooth doesn't work. I called Samsung Tech. support and found Bluetooth to be faulty. She said that because I've had the phone for a few days, that they would do an exchange. I was transferred... I was told that Samsung does NOT do exchanges or repairs. I have to return the phone and then buy the phone all over again after the return goes through. I set up a Verizon account with insurance, and a partial payment plan. Now I have to get rid of the account, and then start from scratch with another phone. I've always bought the Galaxy S models for phones, but this is Bullsh#t, I'm now moving to Apple. Never again. Bad customer service and policies!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Es excelente"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Why not include the charger then how can I charge?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Network cell connections drop frequently. Not to panic, nothing wrong with your Sim card and don't waste money buying new one or time replacing it.
likely a tech issue with SIM Card and Network capability.

Had this phone for 6-7months before without issues.

November Software update killed the recommendation and goodness of this phone.

Your network cell will disconnect very often in 15 minutes; interim user fix would be to switch to slower 2G/3G network.
Pretty sure you didn't buy a nearly 1.5K phone for a 2G/3G speed right?

The glitch is unacceptable; Samsung is unhelpful with customer support; offering scripted resets (which many have tested themselves to reset) with no luck.

Poor service and follow-up."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I am writing with 12 percent left on this brand new Samsung. Let me just say IT DOESN'T MATTER which cell phone company you have, it doesn't matter if you have an iPhone. The cellphone companies are flat our ripping us off and they don't care if we know because there is nothing we can do about it. I have gone through 3 different phones, 9, NINE different chargers and two different cell phone service providers. They intentionally make their phones flimsy so you can either buy more of their products, or use your insurance (the fee you pay monthly?) To (again) PAY for another phone. I'm not one of those people that that their phones poorly, my screens are never cracked. Yet a Samsung brand charger never seems to fit into my charger ports. After a while of playing with it to finally get some charge, it'll drop back down to regular charging.

A Playstation costs $500 and it'll last you 14 years until the next generation. Yet they make these cellphones out of Styrofoam and charge you TRIPLE the price, only for a new model with 3 new features and an extra 300 dollars tacked on to come out the very next year. Rip off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Simply bad product for the money, just got it and will return right away. Bad camera, okey screen , no sd slot, no normal Samsung pay (no magnetic strip transponder in this phone , s20 have it), no charger in box, no earphones, phone looks and feels cheap compare to any older Samsung phone ( s7 edge looks like a spaceship compare to this ""flagship"" ). Even s20fe is better than s21/s21plus and has more futures ( s20fe has sd slot, charger, MST - S21 does not). S21 ultra has better screen but other than that also lacking flagship futures. Camera is bad in it too. I had S21 ultra - returned it already, now got s21+ - will return it ASAP. I usually don't write long reviews but I am really disappointed in latest Samsung phones and have to say it loud. I had every Samsung s phone since s5. No innovations in them since s10. Sad."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","After 3 months it just died. Wake up one morning with the phone unresponsive. I have abused several phones in the past, this was not one of them. It was in mind condition. Going back to my old OP until I can buy a Pixel 6pro."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I was really looking forward to this phone. Sadly, once I got it it really underperforms. I don't remember ever being someplace I did not get a signal on Verizon with my old S8. The S21+ has such poor reception that I can't even make phone calls from several places in Champaign Illinois. I get such poor reception that I have to actively search for a place I can use the internet without Wi-Fi. After getting the phone they told me that wound they have 5G coverage all through the area it's not really 5G coverage and I should just be happy with 4G. Even though I'm paying for 5G. Even though my phone is 5G. They say that when they eventually upgraded that I'll already have a 5G phone. Of course if that's for five years from now I probably won't still have this phone anyway. Actually, if it's 5 days from now I won't still have this phone because I'll be returning it. If I can't use the internet"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This is a great phone, EXCEPT when it isn't. Mine often gets into a mode where immediately after pressing Send to start a call it just plays a little tune and immediately disconnects/does nothing! This happens time after time to any number. This has happened 7 times over 2 months of ownership.

Samsung support seems to think that this is perfectly OK. Their solution is to ""reset network settings"". That works, but it also (for me) involves adding 5 WiFi passwords and 5 Bluetooth devices.

First and foremost this should be a phone that works the first time and every time it is within range of a tower. It doesn't. If that happened during an emergency situation I'd definitely sue Samsung for every penny they have. If you multiply this problem by all the users of this phone I suspect that the odds of this happening during a life and death emergency are 100%

BTW, face recognition is horrible. Fingerprint recognition is sort of OK. It often doesn't work and you end up needing to enter the passcode."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","There is only two things my wife wants in a phone, To be able to make a call and hear her music. This phone will not play music. I've tried the player that comes with phone and several on Play Sore. Needles to say when wife is not happy, no one is. If you want to use finger print reader you cannot use screen protector."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Congratulations to the Xiaomi mi 11 that does have a charger. I bought an S21 and now I have to search the internet for a charger for my cell phone and hope that it does not damage me because I do not know if I buy the original. Xiaomi won them in that they should learn more about the competition or even leave the option of choosing or not the free charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Bought this phone as a gift and and it came out of normal packaging as if it was a refurbished phone and then within 2 weeks of normal usage the screen went blank and stopped working which proves it was refurbished... I dont recommend this seller... They sending refurbished phones and charging brand new price... I want my money back"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Went to look at these phones in person and discovered Samsung made the stupid decision to, yet again, kill the micro SD card slot. They tried this once before with the Galaxy S6 and it hurt them. For some moronic reason Samsung is trying to be like Apple. Here's a hint Samsung, if people wanted Apple, they would buy Apple. The SD card slot was/is a HUGE differentiation between Apple and the Galaxy phones. Bring it back or lose customers. It's just that simple!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone is not worth 800 it looks nice and all but no I could have went elsewhere DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The s21+ great phone I have being using this phone for 1 week I'm ⅘satisfy before making a review and I could say a wonderful experience. The disadvantage with this phone you don't have a Sd card. If you a person that do midium browsing and love great photos s21+ can do well for you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love love love! Got a great deal purchasing unlocked through Amazon versus my carrier's month to month plan AND still under Samsung's manufacturer warranty. Like everyone else, I miss the ultimate flex of expanding the memory via SD card but surprisingly I don't miss the headphone jack. I was so ready to whine about it along with everyone else until I realized, I already only used wireless headphones with my S8+ (yes, S8+). Having said that, Samsung definitely needs to include the charging brick. Get a fast charging usb-c option because your old faithful just won't do it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I have been using the Samsung Galaxy phone since the very first one and have had no other phones since then. I find this version to be the easiest to use. The processor is super fast, the camera(s) are powerful and high level, and ANDROID and Samsung have streamlined the OS and user interface to make the phone pleasant to use.The battery life is much improved, but it is still not stellar (compared to, say, the iPhone).Overall, I am a bigger fan than ever!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Having a new phone is a thrill for most. It would be if it wasn't forced down our throats by the carriers. Problem is that id the case and there lies the rub. I digress. The phone isn't the problem. It is just something else to learn and that isn't a problem. I like the phone. I will get used to it. Now that my carrier has it identified in their system, I can maybe get rid of the buggy operation. For those whose life revolves around their phones, this is blissful. As for me, it is a tool. This is a pretty nice tool too!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Very upsetting I bought this not too long ago to replace a cheap phone that I'm trying to use as a backup and my sim card won't work for some reason so gotta deal with the carrier. I use it for work and it's really disruptive that this just randomly broke. I protected it with a heavy case and screen protector. I was simply scrolling through a web page when it shut off."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've ALWAYS loved android, but this phone is the best one yet!! For starters the battery life is amazing I can be on my phone all day then let my son use it for YouTube and by the end of the day my battery life will be at like 48% or HIGHER! The clarity/color of pictures and videos are so nice very clear and bright! The camera is great as well, has a lot of options for vloggers starting out this would be a nice phone to use to record on your phone! I also think this is one of the best layouts/styles that Samsung has done on a phone to date, it's very sleek!! I LOVE IT and very happy with my purchase!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Every phone I've purchased has been an apple phone and I didn't realize how much I was missing out on until I purchased the galaxy s21+. I love retro gaming and this phone holds all my favorite emulators! My favorite feature is when you hook it up to a television using a hub. Samsung dex mode turns your phone into a computer when hooked to a TV! Best phone ever!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I moved from a S10 non 5g phone to the S21Plus 5 g phone..fantastic 6.7 large screen very fast with Android 12.Absolutely worth the price of this new phone, especially since I use a phone for several years.Received it very fast..Perfect condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love this new phone...great camera fir clear, sharp pictures. Great Battery Life!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it, and was really fast delivery and very good condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like the phone a lot. Very useful and fast. I love the ability to customize and I heard the new samsung UI that is coming out in september is going to be nice enough to replace my custom nova launcher."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Couldn't pass up the sale. This phone is working out great for me. Long battery life is a plus. I'm still finding out all it can do. Love the violet color. 💜"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Should have came with a wall travel charger for the price, but does everything you would want it to and plenty more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I contacted the seller for pics of this used S21+ and he provided those in less than an hour, plus also verified compatibility with my cell service carrier. The merch shipped out the same day and I received it 2 days later. The charge port is a tad bit wonky, but so far no other issues with the phone. And at a price of less than 50% of the cost of a new phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","My S21 does everything great except make a phone call! I have the hardest time just making a phone call. It's very frustrating that this phone just won't pick up a signal well at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love this S21+. It is really a nice phone. Great pictures. good sound."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Really good new phone prior I had an s9. The only thing is I had to buy a part. It didn't come with a new cube."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The battery life is great last all day. The camera is good still getting used to it. When I put on the screen protector is when I had problems with the Fingerprint reader."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Amazing device! Doesn't always detect my fingerprint quickly though. It reflects light so beautifully."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This 21+ works great with cricket!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Love it! Everything is great. It runs smoothly and Good Lock adds even more functionality."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The battery life is not as good as i thought it should be,the phone is a nice phone but if your on you phone for any length of time,you will have to charge it ....the phone does not come with a sim card,or the charger for the wall only USB"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Have had no complaints"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Good 👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great phone but taking time to learn"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Lo compré para un regalo y le encanto!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It appears to be a very good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Pequeña"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The best smartphone that I ever had. The pictures are gorgeous. The battery life is long. The 5G makes it fast online. I liked the Samsung Galaxy 21+ more than the iPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I honestly hate this phone. You can't record with an external mic unless you use a separate app or Pro Mode, and then you lose the ability to use half the modes, filters, and telephoto lenses.. If I knew that at the time of purchase, I wouldn't have gotten it. Awful battery life as well. I honestly regret spending money on this. I would def pick something else if I could go back in time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I'm Samsung Fan & had purchased a dozen for myself in the past 10yrs.. The Galaxy S21+ is over priced for what it actually can do & what you get.. But mine in particular has poor battery life! (I don't do games, watch movies Or do social media applications).. Yet- the battery drains quickly & heats up.. NO memory card slot- just ridiculous!.. Its heavy! The camera is no where near as good as advertised. A step down from the S20 Note & Ultra.. You don't get a power block, just the cord: for $1000, just ridiculous. (One of many reasons why I don't buy an apple).. No Headphone Jack! Ear Buds cause my ears to ring, no matter the quality.. I'm disappointed & Not Happy that these missing key aspects are Not Boldly addressed in product description. Terrible Value! Face & Finger tip reader is just medioce at best.. I Do Not Recommend!.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love the color and in my opinion this is one of the best designs samsung has made. The camera quality is really good! Every poc I've taken looks great! So does the video. The battery last the whole day and charges fast with the fast charging cube I bought. I highly recommend this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought this phone because my pixel 4xl left this world. I was allowed to trade in that phone for this for only 400 bucks so I decided that's fine. I'll rock this till the new pixel comes out. This phone is such a joke, the customization is cool and battery is good. Those are only somewhat redeeming qualities. The face recognition rarely works. The wifi is crap, I'll be sitting at home on wifi and 5g and the phone will struggle to play a YouTube video on 720p. The speaker sucks, and only one of them is interesting. The Bluetooth is unresponsive at times. Also the having two different setups for Android is annoying. I know not everyone is a user of Google. But if I set up my Google account in my android phone. I should be able to delete samsungs apps. I don't want to use Samsung store, or Samsung notes. There's more problems, just don't wanna keep going on about it. Unless you just need a phone. I would not recommend this one. I'll be trading in very soon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love this phone. I pick the s21 plus because I really don't care for the camera upgrade on the s21 ultra. This phone is freaking amazing it's fast and smooth. It has all kinds of bells and whistle. I'm still waiting YouTube videos to get familiar with all the settings and tricks this phone have to offer. I can't see why anyone would leave a negative review. Yes I got this phone off of Amazon and I have had zero issues with this phone. This phone came in perfect condition new in the box. And when I went to register it at Samsung it was all ready register with them and I have over a year warranty."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Extremely fast shipping. Phone in great shape and condition. Working on setting everything up on Phone.Would definitely recommend to others."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I bought it about half years and it is pretty good to use! The only problem is the charge time is quite long, but Samsung is still the best Android phone in this world. Just buy it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","It's a darn good phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I never dreamed a smart phone could cost over $800, and still be well worth the price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone works lovely. Just as described"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I like my new cell phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Have not had it long but it is working great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Everything good 👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Awesome"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","this smart phone is really good problem is shutting it off. the volume and on do not usually shut it down, if your fingers as a woman tiny it takes minutes to shut it why they just did not shut down like the old ones its a mystery"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Now I know why people like Samsung phones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","This phone always searches for mobile network. You always have to select cancel. Very annoying"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","She said it takes the best pictures. Clear and concise."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I absolutely love this phone. I upgraded from the Galaxy A21, so it's a big jump in quality and features. The fingerprint reader works every time and quickly. The camera is great, the night mode is especially impressive. The phantom silver color is beautiful. I prefer prepaid phone plans and had Boost Mobile. Once I got the phone and entered the IMEI, I realized it didn't work with Boost. But no big deal. I just started a Cricket Wireless account and got a SIM card in the mail the next day and voila! Phone service. I keep finding new features to love the more I play around with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","The phone is brand spanking new and crisp right out of the box. I'm so happy and satisfied with the product. I got exactly what I ordered and the phone works like a charm. The finger print reader works like a charm and everything about this phone is amazing I am a happy CUSTOMER this seller Rocks. Remember to buy a USB phone jack and / or bluetooth earphones, a galaxy s21 plus case and a 25W fast charger with your purchase and you're good to go, 👍😊😁."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love the phone so far, it has everything I could ever need and the battery especially is amazing. The phone lasts forever and I can use it nonstop for a whole day and not worry about it getting close to dying. Everything works great, phone looks clean and nice, amazing overall."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","La cámara es buena pero no es super woow!!Lo único bueno es el modo de noche :)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Great battery life"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I've had this for a few weeks now and I must say, one of the best phones I've had. I've had an S8 for about 4 years and this was a significant upgrade! I use my phone mainly for multitasking and social media and it only drops down to around 80-90% depending on how much I multitask. It's almost crazy how much of an upgrade the battery was. Refresh rate of the phone makes it ultra smooth to navigate, photos are high quality, and overall performance of the phone is snappy (everything loads immediately).Only con I can think of is the fingerprint reader. I honestly prefer an external fingerprint reader than an internal one that's built into the screen. I find it quite unreliable as it struggles to read my fingerprint most of the time as compared to an external one where I can feel exactly where to place my finger. This doesn't deter me too much though, as I mainly use the passcode as security and fingerprint as a secondary. The other thing I'm finding is that it struggles to read fingerprint with tempered glass screen protectors, even though sensitivity is turned higher. This issue goes back to the fingerprint reader behind the screen situation, but also not related to the phone as there's a screen protector, so I'll end it there.Overall, one of the best flagship phones you can get out there right now if you're looking to get a high quality and high performing phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Did ok limited to 128 internal memory. Ok if you don't a big memory. Watch out it doesn't get too hot. Something was wrong with mine & I returned it within a week. I GOTTA GO BACK TO U.S. MADE"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","I love my new phone. Needed an upgrade from the s8 and I was excited to see this price. It came in one day packaged perfectly."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","First phone purchased through Amazon. Very happy, perfect phone. Have had for a little over a month now. It's got a great battery life and I got a great price. I was worried about having the fingerprint being in the screen as opposed to behind the phone but it works perfectly. I have had it now for I'm guessing 5 or 6 months now. I am so happy with my purchase. I look to reviews before I buy things and I leave reviews. My opinions will always be honest. Hope I can help someone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Exactly what I was looking for"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Tenia dudas si adquirirlo por Amazon USA, pero me decidí hacerlo por el precio y por el tipo de procesador (Snapdragon) y quedé satisfecho. Gran telefono.Tuve un pequeño imprevisto al momento de recibirlo de paqueteria (UPS). Cuando llegó vi que traía los sellos de Amazon violados no lo iba a recibir, pero el de paqueteria me comento que en la aduana lo abrieron, por eso estaba marcado con letras rojas y le pusieron una cinta con letras verdes de la aduana que decia UPS MEXICO para sustituir la de Amazon que habian roto (también en las notificaciones de envio del paquete aparecia que habia entrado a revision en la aduana), asi que, lo recibí y efectivamente solo abrieron la caja que pone Amazon, la caja donde venia el telefono estaba intacta con sus sellos de garantia. Asi que, me quede tranquilo y comprobe que el teléfono estaba intacto, nuevo y sellado.El teléfono a mi parecer es algo grande, aun no me acostumbro, pero de que vale la pena, la vale.Lo unico que no me gusto y para mi es notorio es que, redujeron la resolución de pantalla; viniendo de una 2k me quedo un poco desilusionado teniendo una pantalla mas grande en éste movil.En general lo he probado menos de un mes, pero estoy satisfecho.Le puse mi chip de Telcel (México) y no he tenido ningun problema, funciona sin ningun problema y lo mejor sin ninguna app de Telcel que solo estan ocupando espacio.Mi experiencia ha sido muy buena al comprar productos vendidos y enviados por Amazon Estados Unidos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","En un inicio tuve mis dudas al querer comprar un producto importado por la posibilidad (he visto varios casos así) de robo o extravío del celular, aunque Amazon siempre respalda todas las compras.Confiando en el azar, pasé de la incertidumbre a la acción y no me arrepiento. Llegó en menos de un mes, aún cuando decía tardaría más. Efectivamente, es la versión de 256 GB de almacenamiento y procesador Snapdragon. La versión vendida desde EE. UU. no viene con el power bank como dice el título, pero no lo necesitarás, de veras que no.Pasando entonces al celular, no tengo mucho que decir. Vengo de un S10 plus y nada extraño, ni siquiera la tarjeta micro SD o el jack de auriculares. El diseño, presencia y velocidad de este móvil harán que pases por alto esos detalles.Hay que tener ojo de águila para notar la resolución de pantalla más baja que sus antecesores (lo probé al lado del S10 plus). La carga ultrarrápida se hace notar y, por lo poco que lo he usado hasta ahora, parece dar batalla con sus más de 4 mil miliamperios de batería.La cámara rinde en todo sentido.En resumen, si vienes de un celular de más de dos años de lanzado al mercado y puedes darte este ""lujo"" quedarás más que satisfecho con tu compra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","El paquete llego bien sellado y el celular venia super seguro en su papel burbuja, se agradece que se considere esa seguridad a la hora de hacer los envíos.De los demás ni hablar, es un teléfono de gama alta, nada se le discute, un excelente equipo, también recalcar que la caja venia sellada, ningun sello violado ni nada por el estilo.Muy satisfecho con mi compra y muy recomendable!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","El artículo llegó rápido pero la caja no contiene los sellos originales de Samsung al igual que el teléfono se encontraba con huellas digitales y sin la etiqueta del número de serie e imei, eso me hace dudar mucho si es un teléfono nuevo o usado e incluso si es reacondicionado, para mi es algo muy molesto ya que acabo de tener in percance con un s20 plus que devolvió porque le entro agua ya que era reacondicionado y compre este para remplazar al otro y tengo miedo que me pase lo mismo con este dispositivo necesito contactarme con Amazon y el vendedor para que me aclaren si es nuevo y si no lo devolveré no me arriesgare de nuevo a que me falle en menos de un mes un teléfono"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Tenía mis dudas para comprar este celular por amazon, dudaba que realmente fuera la version americana, ya que yo andaba buscando esta versión con procesador Snapdragon y ademas que tenía muy buen precio para ser cierto. Pero la verdad todo salió excelente, el celular llego tal cual las especificaciones y pude validarlo sin problemas. Excelente celular, lo que más me gusta es el refresh rate de 120hz."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Todo en perfecta condiciones, funcionalidad al 100%, me encantó el 21+, el único detalle es que no entregan la Power Bank 10,000 mah, únicamente llega el celular S21+, lo entregaron antes de lo programado"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Chulada de telefono, tenia mis dudas si valdría la pena ya que venía de un Galaxy S9, que es una brutalidad y seguía rifando, pero si tienes la oportunidad de comprartelo, adelante, quedarás encantado, detalle en cuanto a sonido pues escuche que sonaba potente, sin embargo suena igual que el S9, de ahi en fuera, una brutalidad de telefonoP.D. Escrito desde mi Galaxy S21 Plus 😁"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Muy bueno llegó en 1 semana, ya cumplí otra semana de uso y ha rendido perfectamente la batería aguantando incluso más de un día. La pantalla es grande pero seguramente podras sostenerlo y escribir con una mano. Viene sellado y funciona perfecto con la red de Telcel aquí en México. (Ojo trae cable pero no adaptador de corriente)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Me llego en perfecto estado, original 100%, la power bank no venía pero amazon supo arreglar ese inconveniente.Este equipo si fue Snapdragon, desbloqueado. Llevo unos 15 días aproximadamente de uso y hasta el momento todo perfecto con el celular y a un excelente precio comparándolo con los equipos que se ofrecen en México.Mas adelante estare actualizando este post."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Llevo ya un mes con el celular y es bastante rápido, en efecto trae el snapdragon. La cámara está increíble aunque si debo decir que el zoom de 30x falla, pero el celular está que mola."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Muy buen teléfono, entrega todo lo que esperarían de un insignia de Samsung, me detectó el VoLTE y la red 4.5G justo al colocar el SIM card de Telcel, la pantalla de 120Hz es excelente, aunque noto que el consumo de energía aumenta al habilitar esa opción."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Me gusto la gran cámara, el tamaño de la pantalla y el precio"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente equipo me funciono bien, llego en buen estado, más rápido de lo que decía la fecha de entrega estimada, estoy en México y fue compatible con telcel"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente celular, su procesador snapdragon es bastante ponte, la bateria del celular dura practicamente todo el día"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Para el precio en que estaba, tenía dudas de si era confiable pero ahora que tengo el producto no me arrepiento para nada."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Funciona perfecto en Mexico, un gran precio y yo le puse Chip Telcel y funciona de maravilla. Una buena compra"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente producto, llegó antes de tiempo, sellado, lo único que le hace falta al celular es que pueda volar :v"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Llegó en excelente estado. Funciona totalmente bien. Con la funda Crystal de spigen se ve súper bien."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Está buenisimo!! Me encanta todo lo que hace y la facilidad de nanejo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Compré el celular en Febrero 2021 y para Julio ya no prendió la pantalla, lo reparé en Samsung y ahora en octubre nuevamente no prende la pantalla, si eres de MX no te van a hacer válida la garantía en Samsung MX y el costo de la reparación es de 7 mil pesos y el dictamen del daño es que algunas actualizaciones no son compatibles con la pantalla… si eres de MX u otro país diferente a USA no lo compres, ahórrate dinero y molestia."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Excelente servicio y excelente teléfono."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Producto de calidad"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","El celular solo funcionó 3 meses apartir de este tiempo presento falla se apagó la pantalla y hasta ahora me doy cuenta que no es la primera vez que sucede ya que hay mas comentarios al respecto.Mal por amazon deberian tener un mejor filtro con sus vendedores ya que tiene mas de 2 semanas que se devolvió el aparato y no tengo respuesta de nadie ni reembolso alguno."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Increible producto"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","Pedí soporte a SAMSUNG y vía remota se conectaron al teléfono y me indicaron que no es doble sim...MUY MOLESTO POR ESTA SITUACIÓN"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus","El dispositivo 10/10 pero no llego la powerbank y Amazon no me soluciono nada de echo se hicieron de la vista gorda."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Last year I was required by AT&T to switch to a 5G phone because they will shutdown their 3G service soon. In Oct, 2021 I purchased this phone (a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, SM-G998B/DS 256GB 12GB RAM International Version) from Amazon because in its ""Product Description"" it said clearly that ""This phone will work with GSM SIM cards like AT&T,..."" It worked, however, only to June, 2022. Since this month (July, 2022) it stopped making or receiving phone calls or text messages. I went to AT&T store. They tried everything until finally discovered that AT&T system doesn't recognize it as a 5G device, which means, this phone can't be used by AT&T 5G network. I thus asked the seller to either refund or replace this phone with one that can be worked for AT&T, but they rejected because ""the returns/replacements period for your order had expired a very long time ago"" - However, the problem didn't appear until this month when AT&T completely shutdown their 3G service! The mistake was due to the wrong information provided by the seller and Amazon in their ""Product Description"" so why should a customer pay for their mistake??!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","This phone is very fast. Has very colorful display, great resolution. The only thing I need is to buy fast charger and see how fast it is."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","This is the best phone I have ever used, fingerprint reader very fast, It lasted for a day and half also screen quality very bright, I actually love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Face recognition, fingerprint & battery life are so absolutely good. I gave it all 100/Percentage"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","When I ordered this phone it had the number I was looking for and the 5g I was looking for. It was a Christmas gift. After Christmas when we went to T Mobile to change to the 5g network, we found out that this phone does not work on the US 5g network. There was absolutely NO WARNING telling us that information. When we printed out the label to send it back we saw someone else had posted the same experience. I was charged over $200 for a restocking fee which makes me angry as I feel this was falsely advertised and the other poster had only had to pay $60. This experience has made me feel very skeptical of what I see on Amazon and made me cautious and distrustful about dealing with them."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Falsely advertised as 5G capable to work on at&t, T-mobile or any US carrier, it does not have any of the required 5G Bands in use in the US, it took me a while to figure it out, with hours on carrier tech support and store visits, finally gave up and returned the phone, unfortunately on the free return, with a $60 restocking fee, which wasn't clearly described either, beware."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","It is smart I like it very much it’s camera"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Great phone no complaints"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Camera goes above and beyond"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Very good all fine"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Yo estaba satisfecho con mi telefono pero ya no recibe llamadas, creo que por haber pagado tanto fallo muy pronto eso no me permite volvcer a confiar"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Open box"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Director's view is awesome."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","The battery life is very short. It's literally melting while I take photos or videos. And it's heating up so quickly. Dont know the reason."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Yeah, until February 2022. Because this phone only supports 3g on American networks. Now that the 3g networks are being shutdown, this is little more than a fancy camera that can't be used as a phone in the USA.

Update: as of June 1st 2022, Voice will also no longer work on this phone on the AT&T Network in the US."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Hi, this product is not what is stated on the description, it has no dual sim capability, it can have two sims in but cannot work simultaneously. Also contacted a Samsung specialist and told me the phone was not internationally unlocked only US unlocked phone. I would not recommend anyone buying this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","5G does not work with Bell Canada and wifi always sleeps when the phone is locked."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Product stop working after two month. They sell me this product factory unlock phone and after two month can not make call or receive call."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","I was looking for dual sim unlocked phone.
This one is absolutely success!
It works perfectly with At&t and sim card from a different country together!
Great camera, great look with my favorite curved screen!
Thanks to this seller!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Love this cell phone. Very easy to set up and use all the features. Takes fantastic pictures!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Es ral y como lo esperaba me encanto no duden en comprarlo🙂"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excellent"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","It works well looks and feels new.. no starches or anything. I'm satisfied. Thank you"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Pros:
1. Order received in great condition. 2. Phone works very well
3. Great camera
4. Nice features

Cons:
1. No charger included in the box
2. Phone is a bit heavier and more clonky than previous models
3. Battery life iffy....got teo full days on the first charge (with music streaming)......now only 2 weeks in and am getting 1.5 days ( with less streaming).

All in all, a decent phone....with a few things to pay attention to.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","As expected, great phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Phone is really good. Camera I feel is best. And it is the last ever (maybe) samsung with infinity screen. Pen works (bought separately). Yes and camera, macro is fantastic.
The seler is local Singapore. Item was new, likely from M1"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excelente, el equipo llego antes del tiempo esperado, de acuerdo a las especificaciones, con sus empaques con sellos originales. Volveria a comprar mis equipos con este vendedor y lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","El celular me llegó antes de lo planeado en perfecto estado, en caja cerrada con sellos de Samsung, para mis necesidades esta perfecto, excelente servicio, recomiendo ampliamente a Karlitashop, ya que también me envío mi factura en tiempo y forma."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Excellent price, prompt communication, fast delivery. Three big pluses and nothing to complain about - not bad at all if you ask me. I recommend the seller. Thanks so much."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 21 Ultra","Muy mal el zoom,muy feas las fotos!!!!,una desilusion,para el precio!!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The battery life is not that good. I got a moisture error and it never went away so I couldn't charge my phone. I had to send in my phone to Samsung to fix. It came back within a week and it's fixed, however it seems like a fail that a brand new phone would have this issue."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Love the new phone it has all that i want and need on a phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","drops calls, needs to be restarted far to often. wifi calling is nice. unless you lose WIFI. then you cant just call them back with service. no you have to restart the whole phone even with 5g service. just to make a phone call. you can still send and receive text. just not phone calls. i bought this Samsung because one plus was getting expensive and not as niche as they use to be. everyone cares about stupid features. just make a phone that works. i don't care about camera that much. i don't care about stupid features like wireless charging or in screen finger print reader. i just want a phone that does what it is suppose to do. why did i think Samsung can deliver?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Great phone but not enough improvement to go from Note 9."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Coming from using a Pixel phone, I had hoped that the reception/antenna function might be better. It was not. It also came loaded with bloatware and now the speaker is intermittently failing to the point of incomprehensibility. I advise against this product."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","for the price, I expected this phone to come with a charger. It comes with a cable, but both ends are tiny. It would make sense for one end to be a regular USB so you could use an outlet or car charger that you already own!Instead, once you realize you can't charge it, you are forced to purchase adapters. The least they can do is explain that in the description!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Changes from previous ones take getting use to."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","More battery life for me, this is not cutting out, I'm planing on returning it for the ultra, just because of the battery itself, it's so bad, I think I might have gotten a defective one? The phone is amazing, and the camera is great, awesome sound with dolby atmos."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Product came as described and in excellent condition"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The media could not be loaded.
 Not sure why all the big tech reviewers praise this phone. My experience has been quite negative. Battery life is awful. I heard you should wait a week or two for the phone to figure out usage, but I have waited and the battery is still awful. I am averaging using 150% battery per day. A lot of the battery drain happens just with the phone in standby. I took a nap with the phone under my pillow and woke up with the phone super hot, just cooking away doing nothing. Lag is present everywhere, but by far anything that involves the camera causes tons of stuttering. I use Snapchat a lot to send photos of my daughter to my parents and I have to wait 5-10 seconds every time I open the app before the camera stops being a stuttering mess. Outside of these issues the phone is quite good, but all the good aspects get outshined by the depressing experience. Video attached of Snapchat lagging."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Comfortable to use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This case fits perfectly and has a good grip feel."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Nice phone but, for the price, you would think it included a charger. Or even the stylus pictured in the instruction booklet."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Love my new samsung s22"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Great batter life, best camera out there, fastest processor. Order a case with it so you don't risk scratches."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Was hoping to enjoy this phone but learned rather quickly that the battery life is very poor. Just using it to take a few photos, search the Internet, send a few texts, and listen to the radio drain the battery fast. On average, about 10% would drain per hour of light to moderate use. Sometimes in 30 min the phone lost 10%. That is with all sorts of battery optimization and app settings to remove background use, etc.

The cell signal avg. 1-10Mbs compared my prior phone on the same phone plan that ranged from 10-400 Mbs.

All-in-all, Samsung didn't do a great job with this phone. I think the new idea of these phone companies putting new phones out each year is just a game to generate revenue based on the ""what will the next year phone give me..."" mindset. But, that doesn't really give them time to truly develop a high quality product and/or implement improvements on existing phones. It is a game between Samsung, Apple, and Google to sell the most at each annual launch. Don't launch something and you become outdated. Not a great strategy when you see the countless reviews of these new phones coming out - many with less than ideal reviews."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Do not buy this product, the battery life is so bad even though it says that it battery life is long. It doesn't even last at all, also the nightography feature also doesn't work so well. The cell reception is just as bad, it is so slow and takes forever to load and connect. I used it for a month now, and I can't stand this phone anymore but I can't return it either. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! TRASH, TRASH, TRASH."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Is the phone coming without an original charger, original type-C cable and headphones."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","the battery heats up, the fingerprint does not work very well. The speaker in this phone has a life of its own. after a month of using this phone, my speaker began to make noise. use my phone carefully"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The Camara is amazing , and the phone is in excellent condition."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Could be revised"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Looks pretty, upgraded from an S9"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The battery life is a joke watch a few videos and it's at 50percent like that. I don't like the upgrades merged my contacts with WhatsApp contacts I hate that so much and wanted to keep them separate."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Crackling noise started after less than 2 months of use. Phone is unusable now. Common problem with all new s22 and no solution on the horizon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This phone cost me almost $700. In the prome day. Save like $200 Unfortunately this phone the video camera didn't have the high quality they advertised. Very poor resolution and when you upload the video everything comes out distorted. I want to replaced and they refuse because retur policy was expired one day. Advise Don't buy telephones in Amazon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Descent phone with Terrible Battery and Price, Apple 5se is better than this ,
I don't recommend it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Battery is horrible. Worst phone battery I've ever had. The phone claims to hold dual sim card BUT IT DOES NOT! Do not buy! It also overheats."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Spekers sounds distortion"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I get 2 days out of the battery before re-charging is needed. Some here say it has bad battery life but that is not the case with me. But then I do not sit staring at my cell phone all my waking hours like I see most people doing. I'm not about to waste my life away constantly playing games, watching videos, doing social media madness, texting and calling friends for hours and hours every day. The other day I was a stop light and looked over at the car next to me and the driver was staring at his phone and the passenger was staring at his phone till the light turned green. I wondered if they did that at every light they had to stop at. It was crazy. I am in the sign business and I use this phone for business and personal use making calls, texting customers mostly and friends. I seldom get online with it, maybe 10 times a month to look something up. I use Google Maps maybe 15 times a month for driving directions to customers locations to survey the building for new signage they need for their business. I don't have 62,000 friends to call and socialize with like many Facebook members do. I wonder if they remember the names of their 62,000 friends or if they have even met most of them in ""Real Life"". I have owned the Galaxy Note series phones since the Note 4 came out but always carried them in the Otterbox Defender case with the belt clip. I decided I was tired of the HUGE phablets and decided to try the smallest Samsung S22 that I could get in my pocket, and I now wonder why I waited so long to get a small phone. I LOVE THIS LITTLE PHONE AND WILL NEVER GO BACK TO A HUGE PHONE PHONE!!! I hope Samsung and other Android phone manufactures start making more smaller cell phones. If you waste your life away on a cell phone all day every day then maybe the battery life may not be as long for you and you might want to consider a phone with the largest most powerful battery in the world in it so you can waste your life away all day on a phone without having to recharge it till you go to bed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I want to buy one closer to Android 14 update for 579.00!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from an S9. The S22 has an amazing camera but must be noted that the battery life is sub par. If you are constantly on your phone you get 5-7 hours of on screen time and I get about 5.5 hours. If you aren't on your phone constantly you may get a full day use.. I think this is kind of similar to my 4 year old phone but I would expect an advancement in battery and not the same or a down grade. On a positive note the phone supports rapid charge and can fully charge in about 1 hour or maybe less. The speakers are louder then my old phone which is great for listening to music. I've owned the phone about 1 week and a few times I've had crackling sounds. This doesn't happen daily but is annoying when it happens. The camera is amazing and having the 3x optical zoom and even using the digital zoom at 20x produces good images and there was no way my Galaxy S9 could compete with that. There hasn't been any major advancements in technology besides the camera. I posted some images. Two photos were edited in lightroom mobile. One is cropped and the rest are natural images produced by the camera."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Poor battery life but otherwise OK."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","The phone is fine but I wish they would offer a refund for the lower prices"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from a moto z after always being a Samsung guy. I'm so happy I came back after the upgrade from Verizon. 5g works awesome. Great reception everywhere. The battery life isn't as great as I'd like but that issue doesn't really bother me. Great size and not to heavy in the hand."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I went from 100% to 91% in 10 minutes of scrolling Amazon and then writing this review. I have had an S7, S9, S10, S20, and S21. Loved them. This S22 battery is so bad, I am going to Apple. Shame on you Samsung for letting this out on the market. The only reason it gets a high rating here is people write them when they first get the phone. Stay away or buy a good backup battery with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Most confusing phone I ever owned...My other Samsungs were easy to work with."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I had to get a new phone when my Galaxy S10 broke. I went to a Verizon store and they said a compatible device would be the Galaxy S22. When I bicycle I use an app to follow a route. With my old phone, I was able to use the app and still have enough battery power to keep the phone charged for the remainder of the day. The Galaxy S22 battery my phone loses power in 4 hours. I went back to the Verizon store and asked for a phone with a better battery. They said they don't track battery strength and the previous phone, the Galaxy S10, has been discontinued. Why do they make new phones with inferior batteries?"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","In the details section above it says this phone has a long lasting battery in capital letters. What a joke, this is the worst battery in a cell phone I have ever had, period! I would not recommend buying this phone because of the battery, and also the screen is on the small side for today's smartphones. Screen is good, camera is good, but the size of the screen is very small, and the battery is just horrible!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","since there is no more micro sd for extra memory i will no longer buy samsung. just disappointing. booooooooo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","AWESOME"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Samsung really delivered a poor product with this year's S22 line and the base S22 is the perfect culprit of this. Not sure about the 22+ and S22 Ultra. This review is only for the S22.

The S22 has such poor battery life, it's nearly unbelievable that it was rolled into production. I had this phone with POWER SAVING and dark mode turned on and I estimated about 5 hours of screen-on-time with light use like refreshing my email inbox. Without a charger handy, it'll be nearly impossible to get a full day's use out of this phone especially with 120hz display. Watching YouTube, scrolling Instagram, Facebook, or memes will require you to charge up to last the day. I did not have the phone long enough for it to learn my usage patterns as an FYI.

The phone did come fully unlocked which is great but I did not see space for dual-sim card use so most likely you'll have to use e-sim. I have T-Mobile and regularly use the S21 FE which has never had an issue with reception. The S22 however continuously lost signal for whatever reason. It wouldn't last long but I may have had a defective unit.

Not all bad news: the camera really is great. Clear photos, 8k video recording, the whole 9 yards here. No complaints in the camera department. Similarly, I didn't experience any issues with the processing power (no glitches or hiccups). With Android 12 out the box, it meant that software updates were next to nil also.

Size: the size is pretty amazing if you're a fan of one-handed use. The screen is fairly small at only 6.1"" but if you're small-handed, this is the phone for you. Your thumb should easily reach all 4 corners making one-handed typing easy.

Lastly, the fingerprint reader was another issue. It wasn't as quick or as responsive as my S21 FE surprisingly. This was without a screen protector as well. I registered my thumb only once so maybe if I had registered it twice, it'd be a different story but from my experience, it wasn't as quick as I would've hoped. Face unlock works super quickly though.

I really wanted to like this phone. I had every intention of making this my daily driver but I couldn't ignore that poor battery life even with my love for its smaller size. I want to try the S22+ but I think I'll simply stick with the S21 FE as it's been my favorite phone out of all the Galaxy line (battery size and screen size coupled with near-flagship specs)."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","This is the worst phone I've ever had. I still owe $600 on it and both the front and back screens are cracked despite using a rubber case. Now there's something wrong with the charging port and it will only charge wirelessly and won't plug I to my computer. I have to find another solution for a cell phone because someone had the bright idea to make a cell phone that you have to treat as if it were an egg.

The insurance through Verizon/assurion isn't even worth it anymore. They want as much to replace it as a good used phone. For the first time I'm considering getting an ""eye""phone. Shame on you Samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","Excelente 👍👍👍"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","just a great phone, just keeps getting better. Set up easily"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22","I upgraded from the S10 to the S22. I'm not going to lie I love the S10 but needed a new phone. My problem with the S22 are 1 battery life rundown too fast. 2 after paying so much money for a phone I had to buy a AC adapter to charge my phone. Tell me now Samsung !! Why can't you guys at the company give a USB port that can just go directly in a USB port. Come on now that's just crazy! I had to spend more money after spending so much money to buy the phone. 3 Why you guys stop making phone with put the Mico sd slot!! 😒.. Otherwise from those problem phone takes great pictures."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Battery life seems to be good so far. I like the bigger screen. Coming off the S9 there's a lot of improvements: camera, screen, fingerprint reader, battery life and super fast charging. Not happy that for almost $1000 they don't include a plug and they took away the ability of adding an SD card. I guess Samsung is taking a cue from Apple..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","La confiabilidad se uso y con las mejoras que se publicitan en cámara y pantalla. El aumento de tasa de refresco se siente. La batería sería el punto débil, porque aunque no es mala, sí se siente corta para un teléfono en el tope de gama."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","It's overall a good phone but it is not 5G as advertised. Was disappointed with that."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Upgraded from a Samsung S8+ and the difference is incredible. This is about as large and heavy a model as I'd want in a phone form factor. The ultra is just too large for me to want to lug around as a phone. Screen quality is great. Battery life is excellent. Very quick and responsive. Samsung has also stated the S22 line is eligible for 4 OS upgrades, so about as future-proof as you can get. Only negatives I have are that it's a bit on the heavy side, but still workable/comfortable for me and the inability to add internal (SD card) storage.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Fingerprint on the front is great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Everything is fine, good phone with good functionality, much more better than iphones, but there is few moments, first there is no factory display cover you should additional buy it and also very poor complication, only cable inside, my device before was galaxy s10+, and that device was really excellent, i think s10 was the last masterpiece from samsung."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone was priced right, it has all the right things that I need on a phone ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","So I loved my S10e but the battery life! This is a little larger and the battery lasts all day now. The fingerprint reader was better on the S10e but not a big problem with the S22+. Went with 256gb. The 30x telephoto is really nice."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I love that the phone loads all my apps really fast, has a long lasting battery and has a good speaker but the camera isn't the best."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Bought two of these phones, both set up the same, but one only gets 16 hrs of battery life and the other gets over 2 days."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Replaced an old phone that was low on storage. So far the phone has been working well. A lot bigger storage. Can be a little tricky when you try to speak your messages."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The Good:
S22 Plus Screen brightness is superior, the phone is light, the battery charges fast.

The Bad:
The battery drains fast with medium use. Touch display is glitchy, at times it would not respond when I tapped. Phone gets hot. Touch display didn't function as expected when using the recommended screen protector. Face recognition never worked.

Summary:
In the box I got some paperwork, a usbc to usbc cable, a sim card tool and no charging brick - as expected. Overall I was pleased with the look and feel. The form factor is good in the hand and the light weight won't tire you out with extended use and the bright screen is probably the brightest I've ever seen.

But that's about where the goodness ends. First of all, unlocking a device should be the one function that always serves its purpose without fail but not the case with the S22 Plus. It just did not work well. Fortunately, the fingerprint reader was fine but only after removing the screen protector. After applying the screen protector the fingerprint reader would not respond so I didn't keep the it on. The display in general seemed very glitchy. When trying to tap around within any app, for example; YouTube, GMAIL, TikTok, the phone would not recognize my taps or gestures. I would need to close the app and reopen. That could probably be patched with a software update but this glitchy behavior is not what you would expect on a flagship phone from a Tier 1 company.

As far as how much I use my phone during the day, I'm somewhere in the middle: I use my phone quite a bit for general checking of email, work communications and watching video content via YouTube for about 1 hour a day while at the gym. I don't do much phone gaming, maybe a casual sudoku or the like but nothing intense. Nor do I watch streaming media for extended periods of time. Even with this medium level usage, I would have around 45% battery or less by 5pm, which is not good for a new phone. It's worth mentioning that this phone charges up fast but I prefer a long lasting battery.

The hot running, fast draining, non functional face ID, and glitchy touch screen was enough for me to return the phone. Instead I went with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. To add some perspective with the battery life, while the iPhone may not change as fast, it charges fast enough and by 10pm I still have like 85% battery or more."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Was easy to setup with metropcs."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Face recognition doesn't work most of the time although in setting up I tried w glasses & without.
Fingerprint reader you have to touch the finger in just the right spot for it to work although SETTING up required multiple positions and touches.
Battery life is OK! Better since you can speed charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I lost my S10+ in the bottom of the ocean. This phone is better in a lot of ways than the S10+. It is faster, brighter, and the flat screen is better than curved edge.
I bought it on sale for $799 factory unlocked direct from Amazon. No way would I pay a higher price for it.
The lack of headphone jack and SD card slot will probably make this my last phone. A few brands will continue to offer these features to capture the market for those that insist on them and I will be one of them.

Note that even on the 256GB version, the OS takes up 33GB of storage so you only really have a little over 200GB."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Great phone. You won't regret it! Unless you are not smart - then you will"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Sin duda es un excelente equipo, quizá la autonomía de su batería no es la mejor, pero su cámara, procesador y en especial la pantalla no tiene nada que envidiarle a otros terminales."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Muy bonito, materiales premium, excelente fotografía nocturna, tamaño adecuado, es rápido, la batería no dura tanto por el precio..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","It's taking me a while to get everything set up as my 9+ this is far superior. I use for business and when I transferred data I had so much more memory left, got the 256. Speed depends on internet, better when I'm home. Love that my windows office files are on here connected with my computer"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Battery doesn’t last as long as I thought it would. But, longer than my old phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","So Samsung advertises long battery life but this is not the case. 24 hours is max. If you are lucky. I use this phone as much as my S10+ and the batteries lasted about the same length of time. Disappointing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I really like this phone. This is my first Samsung. The screen is bright and responsive. The camera is top notch. It has a fast processor. It's a keeper!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","The phone has meet its required standard."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am a long time BlackBerry user and since BlackBerry is no longer in demand or will ever be a 5G I decided to purchase the Samsung Galaxy 22+. It is taking some getting use to not having the query board but I like the phone as a whole. It is fast, has lots of storage even though the micro slot isn't there anymore. I have an android charger anyway so not receiving one from Samsung is fine with me. The camera is on point, the phone handling is good. The hardest thing I have to learn is what all this phone is capable of doing. There is a lot to learn. So any past BlackBerry users who chooses this phone might be intimidated at first but in the long run it will be a great choice to make."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Like phone, good price."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","upgraded from a galaxy s9+
they got rid of the mic jack, no big deal
everything is bluetooth now
no more sd card slot, kinda sucks
updates seem to fix the minor bugs here and there
but the biggest issue with this phone is the battery, i need to have it charging in my car, at work, at home or the battery just drains terribly quickly, tried turning off all the extra amenities like wifi, blutooth, cell phone data when in not using it, but it still drains super fast
my galaxy s9+ still last like 2 days without a charge, I'm lucky if i make it to mid day with the s22+

Update: i can't take it anymore, it's only been a few months since i bought this phone and the battery is atrocious, just terrible, it doesn't last at all, i even did the let it die a few times when you first get it trick to get the battery going but now when ever i hit 10% i have maybe a few minutes, and i mean less then 5 to get to a charger, the thing is I'll charge it fully and take it off the charger and not even an hour goes by and I'm at 85% I've bought the s21FE and will be selling this phone to some poor fool. stay away from this phone if you need somthing you can rely on all day without having to stay wired.
if you read forums you'll see many are doing the same and finding this phone practically brand new for dirt cheap isn't uncommon
it's for a reason, again stay far away!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I like the phone and its camera"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Love the phone❗️great deal at 799
Don't waste more on the iphone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","El teléfono tiene un modelo muy bonito 10, el peso, la calidad dw los materiales. Pero no son suficientes a la hora de comparar precio y calidad.
La pantalla en comparación con oytos celulares se ve con un poco menos de brillo en la luz, lo compré ya que pensaba que era la mejor opción para fotografías y videos y sigo creyendo que si, pero hah aspectos igual de importantes a la hora de elegir y quedarse con un celular, sobre todo si te cuesta en promedio $1200 usd. Toda la comparativa la realizare con mi antiguo huawei 30. Su batería extremadamente deficiente, duraba a lo mucho 5 horas con pantalla encendida y eso que cambie la configuración para ahorro de energía.
El teléfono se calienta con solo mantener una video llamada, eso hace que también la batería se consuma más rápido, me llego con un defecto dd fabrica una pequeña mancha en la pantalla que no era algo alarmante continúe utilizándolo por qué mientras estuviera encendido era casi imperceptible, el audio no es el mejor y lo peor, un dia tome un avión y por alguna razón al bajar del mismo la bocina se había roto, desconozco los motivos pero definitivamente opte ppr regresar a mi antiguo pero buen huawei."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Muy bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I upgraded from the galaxy s9. This was a huge upgrade for me and I'm throughly impressed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I have had the phone for 3 months now and it is plagued with problems. First and biggest if you increase in elevation like driving over a mountain pass or up a steep hill if it is used in direct sunlight for a couple of minutes or just look at it the wrong way the water proofing on the inside warps and causes the phone to stop working. The speakers will just Crackle and the microphone won't pick up anything. There is temporary fix that is so stupid it will make you realize Samsung doesn't have any engineers working for them. You have to remove the sim card tray to let the pressure equalize. But at least 3 times a week I have to open the tray to get my phone to work.
Second. The software it is better then it used to be but honestly that was such a low bar its not a compliment. It is just so so far from being a good experience. Things that you can do on any other phone are if not impossible so deeply buried you will have to spend hours to find simple things like shortcuts to turn on the flashlight ect.
There are more but honestly save your money and get something else. Probably the last Samsung you will ever buy it sure is for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","very poor battery life. brand new phone and battery doesn't last. called support and they won't send replacement phone and won't refund my money.
Called support and nothing was accomplished, they are supposed to call me back with resolve on Monday........I hope it happens. I just want what I paid for! disappointing."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I upgraded from a OnePlus 6 and so the difference has been huge. Everything about it is better than the previous phones. Samsung just took everything that worked in S21 and improved it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Do not buy if you fly often. If you are a frequent traveler you will notice how the speakers crack after flights. That's because issues due to pressure change. Same thing happens with extreme temperature changes. The only fix is to remove the sim card and release the pressure which allows speakers to let speakers vibrate freely again. Not worth to buy for someone who catches 5+ flights per week. Samsung has not recognized the issue but you will be able to confirm this problem with a short internet search."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Perfect"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Excelente producto vale la pena cada centavo invertido"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I have purchased Samsung phones for many years now, but this phone might be the last one. This 1K phone didn't meet or exceed my expectations for its price point. It is an Ok phone. One thing that I was pretty disappointed is that it doesnt have a micro SD card for expandable memory"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Great Android 12 features, build quality and really good camera. I'm pretty happy with it, though, wish the battery was better (I have to charge it 1-2 times a day, and I wonder how it will perform after a couple years). Hopefully Samsung will come up with an upgrade in the future, where performance would vary just like fps of the screen, to preserve battery. As I had better phones 6 years ago, it's hard to say it's the best phone out there."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Overall good phone but you can barely use it because it has such horrible battery life, after you use it continually for a few hours you will be at 40 percent battery. I had an older version of a Samsung Galaxy phone and it had better battery life than this it phone and it was only 500 dollars."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","My first expensive phone and I can't even charge it!! I'm about to send out back just because of this reason. Over $800 and no charger. Super disappointed!!"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Did not include usb cable as advertised in description"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am a loyal Android Samsung phone user and I absolutely love this phone (and so does my Apple user daughter)! The screen quality is amazing!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I purchased this phone from my carrier and it stopped working after 30 days (phone wouldn't boot up). I contacted Samsung and returned the phone for a warranty repair. The phone was practically brand new without a single scratch. Samsung reported the phone had a failure on the PBA, product board assembly and charged me $470 for the repair. When I questioned them on why the charge they told me the PBA was not covered by the 1 year warranty. This board controls pretty much all operations of the phone so if they don't warranty it their warranty is worthless. I'll never own another Samsung device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I've used Samsung phones for years. Must look elsewhere, the lack of an SD card slot is a deal breaker."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I am not impressed. I've had my S22 for a couple months and I like the S9 I had better. I hate that it doesn't have a jack for headphones. Sometimes I need that. You can't measure your pulse with Samsung health like I could with the S9. I wish I didn't upgrade"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","When I first got my s22+ I was really enjoying it. Great screen, good battery life, and great performance. But a few days after I received it, the speaker started making a crackling sound and notifications were no longer audible. After rebooting, the problem remained so it was not a software issue. I did some experimenting and found that when I pressed the middle of the screen, the sound was fine. The minute I let go, it started crackling again.

Clearly these early units have not been put together very well. Samsung support is useless and would not offer a replacement. Instead they wanted me to take the phone to the repair shop. Really? A brand new phone and you want *me* to be inconvenienced due to your own issues? No thanks. I returned the phone instead.

Reading other comments on their forums, this is not a unique problem and Samsung has not yet admitted they have an issue. For those that are outside of the return window, their only option is to send it in for repair which essentially means getting back a refurbished unit.

I'd stay away from this phone until they fix the QA issues which will probably be in ~6 months, at which point the phone will be cheaper anyway!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","A lot better than 4G. On my TMobile 4G S10+ I was only getting around 70Mbps download and 9 to 50Mbps upload. With this S22+ this bad boy can go to 700Mbps and 70-120Mbps upload. Very happy with the speed.

I do not have issue with back of walls. My connect is still the same speed. I notice TMobile using 5G NSA, Which is 5G+LTE. I even have the same speed when I go to my restroom with the door closed. Also, both test i have 0 visual line of sight of the 4G and the 5G tower. I am not sure why people test on youtube have such a huge issue. Outside I get around 750-800Mbps download, and 80 -120Mbps upload."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","Very nice battery life and camera. So far very satisfied with the upgrade from an S10"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus","I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy S22+ as a replacement for a Galaxy S5 which was about 8 years or so old. This new phone has been very good even with a new learning curve for a number of functions. The big issue, battery life, has been great. I recharge it every other day. I will say that I don't play games, stream very little and don't use much data. Also, I do not use the fingerprint reader and that's just me. So far, I very much like the phone and would purchase it again."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love this phone so far. I had been using an S9 and it was starting to act up. There really is no comparison. The S22 Ultra is so much better all around. It's bigger and somewhat bulky though by the time you put it in a case. Supposed to have super fast charging but no wall or car charger comes with it. Just a cable with a C port on each end that I can't use yet because all my wall and car chargers have USB ports. Even my cars built in charging ports take USB cables and it's a Subaru Crosstrek bought brand new in 2019. Seems petty on Samsung's part to not include a charger to fit the included cable. Shame on you Samsung! These phones are expensive and you're acting like a cheapskate!! And that's why 4 🌟 review."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone has good specs and good performance and can run multiple apps at the same time without slowing down. For the money it should have a wireless charger (it only comes with a USB A to C cable and no charger of any kind). I also think that for the amount of money you pay it should have 16 gigs of RAM but it has only 8. It's a toss up between this and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The iPhone 13 is more like a box and much thicker while this one is the usual lesser thickness."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","just get it. Cameras are awesome, stylus is awsome, its fast and works great."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I got this for my bf and he is totally satisfied. He still familiarises himself with the features. Seems to get 2 days of full battery life!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excellent build quality and materials. Responsive, smooth and keeps me productive. Camera can take remarkable photos. S-Pen is very useful. I could care less about the decision to exclude wired headphones and SD card support. There's always a work around.I have access to my home server via SSH. (I will never use any cloud storage service for anything ever.) If storage ever becomes an issue, I can upload everything to my home server. If i need to access anything from my home server, I connect via VPN and browse for what I need on my home LAN. Music, again from my digital audio collection via Plex and the PlexAmp for android.The screen clarity and brightness has not lost its magic. I still find myself whispering, ""Wow, thats just amazing"" from time to time. WIFI, Bluetooth and Cell audio quality all exceptional. Battery life at 50% brightness @ WQHD+ 3088 x1440 last me about 2 1/2 days with moderate usage. ""Usage"" is subjective though. I received mine literally the next day and it was 300.00 less than Samsung and another local big box store.I love the weight too, its balanced and feels soooo quality.My only regrets are between me and the Gods, and have nothing to do with this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I'd like to first note that the transaction was amazing, received in under 24 hrs after ordering, came in perfect condition.5 star phone▪︎Amazing cameras,100x zoom,8k24 compatible▪︎Amazing display , 1440p 120fps(can go all the way down from 1hx to a max of 120hz, I must say the display is so beautiful especially when watching UHD HDR videos!▪︎S pen, I personally haven't used it too much but it can be very useful for artists, writing signatures, taking pictures along with many other tasks.▪︎fast chip!! It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 1 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously, I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters.▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've been using this product for about 3 weeks no problems except connecting to services Worth your money 10 out of 10 recommend"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","For the price we pay they should have included a charger and made a better battery usage ratio (lasts less than a day). However except those 2 well knows issues, the phone is great and super fast !"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone is everything Samsung says it is and I would highly recommend it, but I have a bone to pick with Amazon. I pay an exorbitant annual fee for Aazon Prime which includes 2 DAY SHIPPING. ARE YOU LISTENING AMAZON, 2 DAY SHIPPING! Yet, this was listed as Amazon Prime sold by Amazon and took a week to get to me. I don't want to hear about Covid crap. If you can't ship everything in 2 days like you promised, you should give annual fee rebates instead of raising the subscription fee every year. Wise up Amazon!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Just out of the blue product stopped working. One minute it worked the next it didn't. Nothing functioned, would not start, plugging it in also had no effect. Cell phone was only 5 weeks old"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This seems to be the fastest phone I have ever used, and that means it is faster than my wife's iPhone 13 Pro Max. The screen and the cameras were a huge step up from the Galaxy Note 9 that I have been using before getting this phone. The only down-side I have found so far is the in-screen fingerprint reader. The one on the back of my Note 9 was more convenient, and I have not yet found a screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader on the S22."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I got a great price from Amazon and am very happy as I haven't upgraded in 5 years.I bought the phone because of the camera and display size. I can honestly say I wish I had bought the s22+, because I do not need or use the stylus, and the stylus adds quite a bit of weight to the phone.The phone is super fast and the display is incredible. The only complaint I would really raise is that it seems it gets worse 4g reception than my s9+, but does well if it can pick up a 5g tower.I never found myself in any dead area when traveling near my phone before, but it's happened twice now, which is very stange."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone. Nothing negative to say. Phone arrived on time, new and unblemished. Very happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Very expensive works well so far fingerprint reader is in the screen and not on the back so fancy. I'm 22 and technologically has never been my Forte this is. Pretty simple easy to use phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Well made and high functioning. It has met or exceeded all my expectations except for speech to text and fingerprint reader. The reader has problems with screen covers, even after calibration. Speech to text is not exactly Star Trek but that could also be the online engine.I had a Samsung S21 FE and hated it. Returned after 2 months with the gracious complicity of Amazon. Even when manufacturers and distributors fail, Amazon always goes above and beyond.~JSmith"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I ordered this Samsung s22 ultra 256 gb to replace my iPhone 11 Pro Max because of water damaged . The phone was used liked new from Amazon warehouse . It came with no scratches, everything works and functions like new . No complaints ! I recommend the Amazon warehouse deals and maker sure it works before 30 day period is up to return if something is wrong ."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone came on time look and works great"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I purchase this phone a few weeks ago and it's working really well. Everything that was mentioned came in the box and it was really fast to be delivered (less than 3 days and I don't have amazon prime). Had some doubts because I have brought one a few years ago and it didn't arrive and they charge me (not Samsung another brand) When they deliver somebody must sing, consider that. Have a really good camera and it's similar to the S20 Ultra I had for the last 2 years!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I upgraded from a s9 which I loved to the s22,totally awesome phone even better than I expected,finger print reader very responsive battery life is about 2 days strong as it was said to be I'm very happy with my purchase"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone, great Features but has a few minor issues that I find irritating but I love this phone.Cons:*Face reader is great until you put on a pair of glasses.*Fingerprint reader only works if you rest entire surface of finger on it.*Battery dies quickly if your a heavy user. watch alot of streaming apps, tiktok etc.*Camera is great but is difficult to master you need a master class in how to take a good picture with it.Pros:It's a Samsung Flagship phone. More features than you probably need but can do it all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Me esperaba mejor el rendimiento pero esta bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's ok device"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Camera system is great on this phone. Finferprint sensor is fast and easy to use. I play a lot of games on mobile and they look great and phone battery is very respectable while gaming for hours. Just great performance overall!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The price was a lot but quality was a a good deal. Would have been better of it came with a physical manual and a wall wart to charge phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I owned the first 4 Samsung S phones and I`ve always felt like the devices were not very good. And after the S4, I bought other brands. This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G, and pretty much everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet. The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.I bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love the phone and the speed of the apps loading. However, for a phone that costs $1,000 or more, not having a charger is disappointing. If it would have been included, I would have given a 5 star rating."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Luv the camera. Not user friendly. Try n take a screen shot...laughable"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It feels so nice while holding it, the phone feels prenium again. It doesn't get sticky or doesn't get fingerprints all over."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bought this S22 Ultra 256GB phone to replace my S10+, which is still a great phone, but wanted the better camera and video, and the notepad functionality is cool. No issues so far. Still need to learn how to use all the options the stylus provides, but the phone is solid. I hope to keep this bad boy for a few years, until the ones that have VR capability that syncs with your brain waves.. LOL. Ha, ha."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I upgraded from my OnePlus 7 Pro to the S22 Ultra and have to say it blows OnePlus out of the water. Charges pretty quickly. Maybe not as fast as the one plus, but close. The camera is amazing and clear so far. Still experimenting with sports pictures. The phone is very fast and has a lot of awesome features. Didn't think I would go back to sansung, but the new OnePlus with all the issues wasn't worth the price."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra"," pretty good phone all around. amazing speaker,graphics.."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone (s22 ultra) is not dual SIM. Things like this needs to be front page description. Its not enough for me to return but I would imagine its needed for others. Otherwise its OK so far. Early to say for sure. Prob will adjust rating after a month of use."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Very good phone. Love the quality of the pictures, much better than IPhone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I limit my comments to the use my limited vision permitts. A large, bright. high quality screen. The Samsung accessability settings offer a number of very helpful features including large bold print a special keyboard. and . Talk Back. The phone also permits answering a phone call by pressing to up volume key. Depending on use. battery has always lasted the day and then some. It has been a good purchase continually offering useful surprises as I fumble along."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone was packaged good and is very nice no problem putting in my Sim card or working. Very clear pictures. 5G is considerably fast on TMobile . Awesome phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excelente choice no regrets"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Awesome phone, but I don't like how settings are hidden behind a console. There are basic settings available on my S7 that are non-existent on the S22, unless you download some software and practically hack into it. But all-in-all a good phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I must commend this supplier. The phone was packaged excellently, very secured and came as ordered, factory sealed. Will definitely do business with them again."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's a really nice phone however, I am disappointed with the accessories that came with it. The package doesn't even have an adapter. Just a USB, how am I supposed to charge my phone? The phone is also quite slow. I am surprised at how slow the phone is. The phone didn't come with the pin to open the sim card slot, how am I supposed to get my sim card in or out of the slot. Just so much I am disappointed in. I've been a loyal Samsung client for over 8 years and I've never been more disappointed 😞"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I came from a Note 8...so this phone is just fabulous and fast!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've been using this phone for a week or two now. Very satisfied with my purchase. I used the note 9 (which I enjoyed quite a bit) and an s20ultra (which I did not enjoy as it was plagued with software issues, mainly issues with Bluetooth and the cameras) and finally ended up on this phone. This phone is actually very solid in terms of performance and stability. The screen is very sharp and bright, the inscreen fingerprint reader is quick, the battery life is average on 75% brightness, the camera is great and the spen is back and as good as ever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Una buena compra y un 10 de 10"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone is definitely the ultimate Android phone. Best screen, best cameras, latest processor, and the S-Pen. I absolutely love this phone. I have no regrets whatsoever."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","What I do not like, have to hold volume down button and of button same time to get to power down"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The Galaxy S22 Ultra is an excellent phone with everything, plus the kitchen sink. The phone feels great in my hands (I probably have average man hands), and the fingerprint sensor works faster than my old S20+. The screen refresh rate is at a default of 120 hertz and does drain the battery a tad bit more quickly. The phone can get to 25% by 6 pm with a full charge. If you are a fan of Galaxy or looking for something different from Apple, the S22 Ultra is the way to go."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Finally decided to make the switch from iOS to Android. Very happy with the decision. Obviously a bit of a learning curve but other than occasional issues with the fingerprint reader, this has been an awesome phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Simply the best camera phone. 🤳 👍 zoom 10x and 100x. Can even capture the moon"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","La batería dura bastante si no lo usas, pero el uso regular que le doy al celular consume mucho la batería, pero de todo lo demás me encantó el celular"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Honestly the face recognition is not bad at all, in fact its very good, but the fingerprint scanner is so very very bad. I have to try 5 to 7 times to unlock my phone even after I update the software. On top of all that, the sound quality is horrible, I have a Samsung S9+ My S9+ sound quality is way better than S22 Ultra!!!
Aside from all these which I could understand, and wait for a software update and hope for the best for me was the battery which was getting too hot even for day to day tasks, so I sent it back, I expected the best from Samsung specially when you pay almost $1500."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is worth the money"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I have used a Galaxy S series for the last 7 or 8 years.. I always got the top of the line every year.This Phone has the worst battery life I have ever seen. To me it was such a problem I returned it, spent $500 to replace the motherboard on my S21 ultra and will use it again. SORRY"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","When im trying to sign documents the pen doesn't work on certain parts of the screen"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Battery life sucks. I don't like the one side only controls nor the Bluetooth only headset option. Pictures are much nicer than my older version and videos are nice. But if the phone is dead or dying most of the time, having all the extras is pointless because you can't enjoy them without worrying your phone will die."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This replaced a Note 10. Loving this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Fue lo mejor
Excelente servicio"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Everything about this phone is awesome. I upgraded from a Samsung note 10+"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's not much diferent than my previous Note 10+, only hw upgraded, with the latest software upgrades both are almost identical, but it's an excelent phone, i'm very satisfied."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The picture quality from the camera is amazing. The screen is crystal clear and the birghtess I've ever used. The refresh rate is second to none. And being an avid Note owner, I love the stylis being included. It is truly a Note worthy device."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Todo bien en tiempo y forma"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great for the price"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Samsung claims 45W charging on the S22 Ultra, but using a USB C test meter, I've never seen more than 30 W. Maybe there's some point in the charger cycle where it hits 45W for a few minutes, but it's definitely not a sustained charging rate. You can find videos online showing that using a 25W charger vs using a 45W charger barely makes any difference. Don't waste your money buying a high power charging brick. You won't benefit from anything over 25W."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Me encanta, se siente muy bien. Todo funciona de maravilla. Super recomendado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The screen should have privacy features and the charger cord is too short.and for that price throw in some ear bugs OK (Lol)"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","5/5 best phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Phone box was not sealed both security stickers were missing phone seems to be good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I didn't get a chance to try it out . Would not work with xfinity system."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I like the photo options"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","As I Galaxy Note fan since the Note 2, I finally decided to upgrade from my beloved Note 8 to the Ultra 22. I am sooooo glad I did not trade my phone! The Ultra 22 started out promising with zest and a premium feel. I spent at least $200 trying to find the perfect case and screen protector for my 4-5 year, $1271 investment only to have it give me the black screen of death on day 29. I called Samsung who sent me to UbreakIfixit. They pronounced my phone d.o.a. Samsung then played hot potato after telling me it would cost me to have them service the phone. I then called Amazon only for them to try to shift it to Samsung. Samsung had already told me about the 30 day Amazon money back guarantee. The Amazon rep tried to say it had been more than 30 days when I called them on day 30. Now I am stuck waiting for UPS to pick up the dead phone to process a full refund. It has been 3 days now. My local UPS driver did not have the shipping label on day 1. They didn't bother to show on day 2. What a world!

I have never been let down by Samsung before. By far my worst experience with any phone! I am even thinking of switching to Apple now. As much of a Note/Android/Samsung fanatic I have been over the years, I am not sure what to do next. But I am sure that I will hold to my fully functional Note 8 until it dies. It surely has lasted me for more than 29 days!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I love yhe phone and would recommend it. The Camera and The Pen are just Amazing"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone but pricey!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Red flashing dot appears on screen and blinks. There is no registered 5g service anywhere. Asked for a replacement since I paid in full for this product and it was expensive and supposedly brand new. Amazon said they would replace and I send old device back.
I then received and email explaining that the phone was a high value item and could not be replaced. I could purchase another. However the new one cost $100 more currently and would not reach me in time for the data transfer from phone to phone. Amazon states I need to return the phone within 3 days. However a new device through Amazon would not reach me for weeks. I stated that's not really fair. Amazon states that's too bad and proceeds to hang up because there is nothing else to be done. Bad phone, bad service, bad all around. Still waiting over a month for refund and they won't give it back. Still fighting with them.
Update: still fighting 30 days later for a refund. They received the item back Sept 16th and refuse to examine it or update file so that I may get refund. 30 day minimum wait for them to even look at it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Fast, battery life is great, great design, beautiful vibrant display as well as fantastic speakers. Overall a great phone and happy with it so far."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","All I can say is, WOW! This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. Only complaint I have is the phone gets a little warm when I wireless charge it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Fast shipping and absolutely great product"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Has alot of cool stuff and can run games very well but that not what I need a phone to do when a need my phone I NEEED MY PHONE TO CALL PEOPLE this phone has too much horse power not enough Battery to handle it!!! Camera is THE BEST the only thing that I think makes this phone worth anything at all...."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Connects to 3G towers instead of 5G towers.
Callers get weird “out of the coverage area” message, when I supposedly have full signal.
When my phone occasionally decides to ring, the audio quality is terrible and frequently drops calls.
When I try to place a call, it takes 20+ seconds before it even starts ringing the other person.
Says “emergency calls only” with active service plan.
The digital compass won’t stay calibrated in Google Maps.
S Pen doesn’t automatically wirelessly connect for air actions."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!
After 2 months the phone started oveheating. Never been used for gaming or anything similar, never has any tab left open, and always kept updated. When this stated the phone will not charge and the battery will be depleted in minutes, charging has to be done in increments and the phone will not charge once it gets hot!!
Amazon refused to accept the item back since you only have a 30days return window, said to contact Samsung or pay $200 restocking fees to return this defective, fire hazard device.
I had many Samsung devices (S4, S6, S9, S20) and never had this happened, I wish I did more research before getting stuck with this mess!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The battery life on this thing is basically the same I was getting with my 3 year old S9, constantly plugged in.

The stylus in place of a headphone jack? Who's brilliant idea was that? It's not 2005 anymore and this is not a blackberry.

Several other annoying little things; during a call, the phone will lock the screen which doesn't allow you to return to the number pad so you best not be needing to type something for your phone call, most of the cases for this thing do NOT support wireless charging, the texts from different people in my life are seemingly all random colors, it's weird af, literally cannot prevent several apps from sending me notifications (like Samsung pay? Who uses that), just all around annoying small things.

Will probably not be buying another Galaxy in the future."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","So disappointed, I bought this for my wife for our anniversary.When I tried setting up the phone, it kept boot looping.So now I have a nonfunctional gift to give my wife and no time for another one to reach my country.So disappointed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The media could not be loaded."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone is glitchy, drops phone calls, delayed texts, and emails. I have had the phone for a month and in my opinion it would have been better to go to an AT&T store."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Way to expensive to not come with a charger."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Had the phone for less than 10hrs and the phone has dies 20x times. I've never had an iPhone ever but the frustration that this BRAND NEW phone has caused me is more than I wish to deal with. Beyond frustrated. I don't think I've ever written a bad review, but how isn't that I spend $1,000 on a product that doesn't work?!! Complete waste of my time!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Main camera failed within 6 months. Took the device to Geek Squad, they assessed no damage and cannot figure out why the hardware failed."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I purchase this phone thinking it’s brand new. When I got it, no charging cable, camera doesn’t work as describe pictures aren’t clear and then the speaker is going in and out. Not worth it"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bought phone and it came with a broken screen."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Android still not working properly after all these years. Phone loses signal and has to be restarted everyday. Weak cellular signal when you do get it and just a ton of bugs with the phone. Notifications only work half thr time. Beautiful looking phone, just doesn't work half the time."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I ordered this used but in like new condition but this phone I got is definitely not like new. Deep two scratches in the screen followed by a few minor scratches. This is not a like new condition at all."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","No sirve no le dura la batería nada"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The phone arrived too late, so I buy another one in another place and little less price 👀"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","If you have S21 do not upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've had this phone for about 4 months now and love it. I bought it because of the superb cameras and also for the 5g. I upgraded from a lg v20 and I'm amazed at the speed of the processor and fast charging time that gets me fully charged in minutes and not hours. The camera is better than I hoped for. The pictures are of excellent quality, even at the 100X setting, although at that magnification a super steady hand or some support is needed. I bought a Doxlion Case Case with Camera Cover on Amazon which has a clever sliding door that covers the lens when not in use for perfect protection. I'm really enjoying taking pictures again wihout the need to carry a heavy camera and hoping I have it when a photo op arises. Samsung is really producing some winners with this phone plus the flip and fold phones. They've left Apple in the dust with their monotonous selections."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","screen scratches easily. zero improvement over S21. Square edges are I think required by the s/pen, which is basically useless; and the square edges are a hassle and more damage prone. No discernable difference in picture quality. side by side with my (cracked screen) S21, the S21 screen is brighter and nicer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've had the phone since March. My previous s10+ that I had for 3 years will give me a longer battery life than the s22 ultra. What's really frustrating is once this phone hits 5% battery you only have minutes to place it on a charger or it will die. While on my s10 it seemed like the last 15% the phone would last even longer than normal this one just dies super fast. I have watched and updated different settings to try and improve the battery life but this thing barely makes it through the day with me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I was really nervous switching from my Apple phone to Samsung. The last Galaxy I had was 4 and it really sucked. But I gotta say, it's $150 cheaper than when I bought it but It was totally worth it. I love this phone!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is by far the worst phone I have ever purchased. With WiFi on this phone will not download phone apps or pictures/images from websites or Facebook. I have to turn off the WiFi and used the mobile network to download. The battery life is terrible. The battery will not last a day with normal use. I have to charge the phone before the end of day. The camera takes blurry and grainy pictures. Face recognition does not work. For the price, this phone is just not worth it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Most reviews say nothing about the improved modem over the past few years x50 to x55 x60 x65 etc.. It is HUGE as far as connectivity to LTE and 5G network bands. Now they are incorporated into the CPU instead separate like on the note 20 ultra and prior and are absolutely monumental for good reception and speed. One of the most important features taken for granted and never reviewed. This phone with series 8 gen 1 has the most advanced CPU/modem to date for excellent connectivity and speed in the most remote places."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is an unfortunate downgrade. I went back to the Note 20 Ultra.

Reasons include:
1. Speaker is terrible compared to the Note 20 Ultra. I'm not alone in this assessment. Softer, less rich, and staticky when pushed. The Note 20 Ultra (I had access to three of them) speakers are significantly better.

2. No SD storage card expansion.

3. Credit Card MST capability removed which means I cannot use the phone for credit card scanners which are still very commonly used.

The camera is an improvement for sure - probably the main improvement I liked. But not enough to offsett the losses, especially the speaker which I use very often. The Note 20 Ultra is as capable except for the camera which only goes to 5X instead of 10X."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","If you liked the S21, this phone is a noticeable upgrade, albeit some of the benefits are definitely subtle.

I bought this series of phone for the Camera, and having gone through a few iterations of the ""S"" line I'm so far very happy with the update to the S22 Ultra.

The caveat. This is a brittle phone. Yes, I'll repeat that. This is a brittle phone.

I would go so far as to say, that if you get the phone and don't have a screen protector, do be extra extra extra careful. One drop on the pavement and you'll be hating life... $1k to a pile of ugly glass in minutes. Buyer be warned..."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Cannot transfer ANYTHING to PC. The minute you connect your phone to your PC, it starts charging your phone without giving you the option to transfer files."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I got an overheated phone after texting msgs on fb messenger in 20 mins. Other things were good. Fast delivery and good Amazon services. I decided to return it. This problem made me change my mind. I thought I would re order another SS Ultra 22 but I already have many phones with me. SS Note 10+ it's still a great phone until now I think. Iphone xs, iphone 13Pro. First annoying experience can make me stop buy SS ultra 22 although I wished to have. Next year I will buy Ultra 23."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","The year is 2022 and yet the Bluetooth have major bugs. I haven't owned this not even a month and yet it has major bluetooth bugs everytime I use it. The previous phones like samsung note 10+ had way better connection on bluetooth. Sometimes the bluetooth drops down on certain times. The 5G isn't even better than 4G with connection to the internet is slow and sometimes you cannot connect and browse. Unless wifi. This phone is a major let down. I don't recommend unless you wanna pay arm and a leg for something that isn't fully fixed or said to have been made into. Better this and better that. This phone is major going backwards."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is probably the worst phone I have ever purchased.
For someone not used to Galaxy phones it is probably fine, but for me the changes RUINED this phone.
Having to turn it on from the side, the new icons, etc... all horrible.
The case is super slippery.
Reception is far worse that my old Note 9+, and sound quality is noticeably worse.
For some reason with this phone my device files (music) will not show up on YouTube music on my Android Auto.
Buying this phone was a HUGE mistake for me."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Have no idea, why Samsung suddenly decided to remove SD cars from 21&22, I'll will not buy new one until they do understand, people need more space for just watch/listen music/TV shows and the easiest way is just put SD card with Gb of data and watch/listen on demand. Who is in Samsung thinking like a moran? Really sad, will send it back."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Bruh I knew all the specs were a complete lie bro. I had Samsungs in the past and this one is no different. I mean 8k camera quality? That doesn’t even exist. 45w charging? Your battery can’t even hold that capacity or it would degrade in like less than a month I mean it’s an okay enough phone just don’t expect any of the specs to be accurate"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've been a SAMSUNG customer/fan since the Galaxy S III in 2012. I Ordered/Purchased the Galaxy S22 Ultra from Verizon on 3/2/22 with scheduled delivery setup for 4/8/22. Phone arrived and was setup using WiFi/Smart Switch on 3/28/22. I immediately noticed that phone was running ""Mad Hot"" during calls/use/charging (Very sadly reminiscent of the SAMSUNG Galaxy S7 debacle, which I also owned/returned). Next, my new SAMSUNG phone started shutting off and on, at a very rapid rate, by itself. I contacted Verizon, and an exchange was setup, at my local Verizon store. Verizon had endless problems transferring my personal data from the defective S22 Ultra to the new replacement S22 Ultra, due to the defective S22 Ultra constantly shutting down. I ended up successfully doing Smart Switch transfers, at home, using my WiFi. Next, I had to trek to FedEx to return the defective phone. Just after FedExing the defective phone, I attempted to photograph my FedEx receipt, as I needed to get my sales tax on the defective phone refunded....YES, I NOW HAD TO PAY SALES TAX ON TWO PHONES!!! Unfortunately, THE CAMERA on the replacement S22 Ultra phone was inoperable. The Camera App was BLANK!!! I immediately contacted SAMSUNG Customer Service/Tech Support, and a Tech fixed my replacement Galaxy S22's camera function. All in all, not an enjoyable, albeit uber time-consuming break-in period with my new SAMSUNG product. I really looked forward to upgrading from my SAMSUNG Galaxy 9+, but the experience thus far, has been one catastrophe after another. I felt very let-down by SAMSUNG and their product quality control. Now, I only hope that I can update this review with some positive updates."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This is a good looking phone but it is very heavy compared to the Note 10 plus. It is also much thicker and not comfortable to hold for long periods. There is no real perceptible performance difference while using.
The camera is amazing and the zoom is unbelievable but in my opinion it is not worth the cost. My Note 10 plus performs all other functions just as well and is much easier to carry around.
Things to be aware of are the lack of SD card slot and if you are on Verizon or ATT you can't turn off 5G without a third party app.
Bottom line is I'm returning this to Samsung. My 10 Plus is just as good 3 years on and I just can't justify the huge price tag for what is essentialy a camera upgrade."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Recomiendo este celular"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I have this phone for two weeks already so far very good!
This is my first Samsung phone.
The Galaxy S22 surprised me, with all the functions.
Before I always was using IPhones.
No issues, fast charging, battery life is great, modern design, beautiful vibrant display, and fantastic camera.
Great phone, happy with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","There is nothing to dislike about this phone you won't regret it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Great phone overall, wish the battery would longer."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Do not buy Samsung electronic devices, especially from Amazon. Samsung is a dishonest and deceptive company that makes defective phones and does not honor their warranty guarantees. They do not consider Amazon receipts to be valid proof of purchase, so if you buy a phone here they won't honor warranties or do any repairs on it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","İt was good experience"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Oh ya"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Entrega muy ágil y el precio fue muy bueno"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Lo mejor en cámaras y rendimiento en el mercado."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Big downfall is that you cannot screen incoming phone calls
Besides it having an amazing camera 100x zoom and great macro and nighttime camera great photo editing features I think this photo is about average and overpriced."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I've only owned this for about a month, but I'm really liking this phone so far. The size is as expected. If I hadn't expected the handful of a phone I may have had other thoughts as to how large it is. I'd say it's exactly as expected though. It is a bit heavy, but the battery is lasting me 2-3 days usually. I'm not watching lengthy movies on it yet so that would probably affect how they last. It's a fast and responsive phone though. It updates quickly over 5G and Apps seem to run quickly. I'm very pleased with it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Husband loves this phone! Many features. Battery life phenomenal! Pricey as is the iPhone but worth
It! Fingerprint reader works well."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Samsung makes great phones. I still havent used many of the features on this phone but am amazed at its speed to go online. Never used my phone for online before this phone."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","This phone is super cool 😎
Samsung did a amazing job
They're definitely better than Apple iPhone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Perfect."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","It's an awesome phone. Camera is awesome. Battery could be better but if you set the phone apps properly it'll work well. I really like the S22 altra by Samsung a lot. Peace ✌️"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","I like this phone, it has 5 cameras, you can zoom in a second object from far away, it can open with fingerprints or your face, battery life is good"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Does not overheat and shut down like my Xperia 1 used to. Video zooms smoother than my Note 10 plus. Nice moon shots. Love it."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Como dispositivo móvil no puedo desear más, sus especificaciones de ultima generación, su buena durabilidad de bateria (a esta hay que darle una semana más o menos para que se adapte a tu manera de usarla ya que es inteligente), sus excelentes materiales de construcción e incluso sus cámaras no me dejaron con nada que desear."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Perfect for the upgrade i needed was easy to transfer my information from another phone..the camera is incredible more space available to store additional information i needed .....only thing is no adaptor head was available only the cable for charging purposes"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","And now it won't even let me upload a photo, says that it is an ""unsupported file type"" even though I took the picture with this phone. Takes amazing pictures, Battery life is ""OK"" it is not as good as my old phone with the same size battery. Lose connection every time I walk into a building. Fingerprint scanner is another Let down, text talk still sucks. So basically you get a really nice camera for more than a $1000. Screen display is pretty good, Screen sensitivity is pretty good."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Like my review states my phone was damaged out of the box! I wanted a replacement and was told I had to just get a refund because a replacement was impossible! The phone itself is actually GREAT! This review is due to amazon! :("
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Amazing phone I bought 2 one for me and my gf. We've never had phones this nice before"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Nice phone"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","El equipo ya lo conocía y es una maravilla sin embargo el vendedor primero dice que tiene garantía internacional y en samsung no hacen valida la garantía, tendría que tener una factura de USA para que pudiera hacer valida mi garantía y seria un problema hacer todo eso, desafortunadamente el vendedor miente en esa parte y tuve que devolver el producto."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excelente, todo bien empaquetado y llegó antes de lo estimado"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excelente celular!! Me encanto!!"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Es muy buen teléfono para sacar fotos, videos y sobre todo ver películas y poder dibujar con el spen, pero para lo que realmente lo compre que es para jugar juegos como Mobile Legends y Lol su rendimiento no me gustó"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Estoy muy satisfecho con el equipo, viene sellado la caja y todo nuevo como lo anuncia la publicación 1000% los recomiendo, llego antes de tiempo y todo bien"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Llego sellado y nuevo. Todo en orden y hasta el día de hoy es un avión. No hubo temas en la compra ni con la entrega ya con código, eso si lo abrí frente al repartidor y como que no le gusto pero entiende que han tenido malos manejos algunos. Igual pude facturar sin temas la compra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excelente celular, el mejor Android de 2022. Vale la pena y es confiable este vendedor, el equipo me llegó nuevo"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Lo mas importante ! Llego en perfecto estado ,nuevo y sellado de fabrica , muy buen telefono , el unico detalle seria el rendimiento de la bateria , en mi caso me llego con procesador Qualcom"

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Todo en orden"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Llegó sellado, el color correcto, la pantalla espectacular. El dispositivo se encuentra desbloqueado y acepta la red 5G sin problema. La versión es correcta con la de USA, mi única sorpresa (no para mal) es que este celular es dual SIM."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Excelente compra, lo agarre en promoción, por 25 es una buena compra, se calienta un poco cada cierto tiempo, la batería no dura mucho, uso continuo quizá unas 4 hrs con batería llena, aun así es buena compra"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","El paquete llegó bien, piden contraseña, el teléfono está en excelente estado, sellado, nuevo. Los S22 no traen cargador, solo el cable tipo C. Hasta el momento el teléfono funciona perfecto, y llegó en el tiempo estimado por la App."

"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Compra 100% recomendada, llego sellado el equipo y en perfectas condiciones. Una buena compra"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Cuidado de ser estafado, si vas a realizar esta compra antes de dar el código para recibir el paquete, toma evidencias del repartidor y unidad. Ya que en mi caso me tocó recibir el paquete sin el equipo dentro, venía únicamente caja del celular con cable USB y manuales. De ser posible grábate abriendo el paquete para que tengas todas las evidencias necesarias en caso de que te pasé lo mismo. Ahora estoy en ascuas y en espera de que me hagan el reembolso de mi compra."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","El celular no parece ser nuevo, viene rayado de lo lados, y no trae los sellos originales de Samsung"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Me enviaron el color equivocado; incluso la caja está marcada como Phantom Black. Desconozco si el teléfono es reacondicionado; los sellos que venían en la caja me parece que no son los originales de Samsung. El teléfono aparece en venta como ""nuevo"". Por lo demás el teléfono ha funcionado bien."
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","1. El color que dice la publicación es negro y me llegó un color gris

2. El celular es de Canada no de US.

Lo devolví ya que no fue lo que yo pedí con base a la publicación"
"Samsung","Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra","Dicen q es dual sim y no es cierto"
