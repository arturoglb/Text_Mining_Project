The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare the treatment of Apple and Samsung phones by consumers on Amazon's website, as well as the vocabulary used in the reviews. The focus is on three years of reviews, from 2019 to 2021. 

In the first section, we will describe the data and the steps we took to clean and transform it into a corpus. We will also provide graphical analysis of the corpus throughout this section. In the second section, we will perform sentiment analysis to understand how consumers react to these brands over time and depending on the model. In the third section, we will use unsupervised learning techniques, such as LSA and LDA, to identify clusters and similarities in the reviews and to analyze topic attribution based on the model being reviewed. In the fourth section, we will use supervised learning techniques, such as Random Forest, to predict future values such as sentiment prediction based on the brand. Finally, in the fifth section, we will provide our conclusion.
